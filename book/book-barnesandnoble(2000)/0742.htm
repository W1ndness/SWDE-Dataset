Both the twelve-year-old and his father become fugitives, forced to run from Coos County&#8211;to Boston, to southern Vermont, to Toronto&#8211;pursued by the implacable constable. Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them.<br><br>In a story spanning five decades, <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b>&#8211;John Irving&#8217;s twelfth novel&#8211;depicts the recent half-century in the United States as &#8220;a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course.&#8221; From the novel&#8217;s taut opening sentence&#8211;&#8220;The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long&#8221;&#8211;to its elegiac final chapter, <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b> is written with the historical authenticity and emotional authority of <b>The Cider House Rules</b> and A <b>Prayer for Owen Meany.</b> It is also as violent and disturbing a story as John Irving&#8217;s breakthrough bestseller, <b>The World According to Garp.</b><br><br>What further distinguishes <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b> is the author&#8217;s unmistakable voice&#8211;the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller. Near the end of this moving novel, John Irving writes&#58; &#8220;We don&#8217;t always have a choice how we get to know one another. Sometimes, people fall into our lives cleanly&#8211;as if out of the sky, or as if there were a direct flight from Heaven to Earth&#8211;the same sudden way we lose people, who once seemed they would always be part of our lives.&#8221;
</p><h3>The New York Times - 
												Michiko Kakutani</h3><p>Mr. Irving uses coincidences, cliffhanger chapter endings and other 19th-century novelistic devices to hook the reader, while at the same time orchestrating them to underscore the improbable, random nature of real life. Some of his inventions&#8230;are ludicrous at first glance, but the reader gradually comes to understand that they are writerly metaphors for the precarious nature of life in "a world of accidents," that the volume we hold in our hands is, in fact, the creation of Danny, who is trying to make sense of the unlikely trajectory of his life through the act of writing. In this respect <i>Last Night in Twisted River</i> emerges not just as a tall tale, but also as an entertaining, if messy and long-winded, commentary on the fiction-making process itself.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>John Irving's novels can sneak up on a reader -- you might begin by laughing at his eccentric characters but be in tears by the end of the book.

											I love John Irving and I think he is a great writer, however, this book was not his best.  The beginning and end were the best parts but the middle became tedious to get through.  Some of his content was very political and he touched on things like the Vietnam War and September 11th.  If you are a John Irving fan, it is worth reading because of how great of a writer he is but some who have not read him before might find it boring and too long.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>John Irving: Last Night<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-2"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1334404_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781400063840_BK_1_1334404" href="#previewReview_1334404" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>March 13, 2010: 
											I've been a great Irving fan since his first novel, Setting Free The Bears, when I was one of about 4,000 people who might have read that book. I've enjoyed all of his books since  (that I've read) until this one, that just feels like it was written into a tape recorder.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35705228.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>John Irving</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>John Wallace Blunt, Jr.</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Vermont</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>March 02, 1942</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Exeter, New Hampshire</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A., University of New Hampshire, 1965; also studied at University of Vienna; M.F.A., Iowa Writers' Workshop, 1967</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>American Book Award for <i>The World According to Garp</i>, 1980; Academy Award for <i>The Cider House Rules</i> screenplay, 2000</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>It was as a struggling, withdrawn student at Phillips Exeter, the New Hampshire prep school where his stepfather taught Russian history, that John Irving discovered the two great loves of his life: writing and wrestling. Modestly, he attributes his success in both endeavors to dogged perseverance. "My life in wrestling was one-eighth talent and seven-eighths discipline," he confessed in his 1996 mini-memoir <i>The Imaginary Girlfriend</i>. "I believe that my life as a writer consists of one-eighth talent and seven-eighths discipline, too." <p>    Certainly, patience and stamina have served Irving well -- in both wrestling (he competed until he was 34, coached well into his 40s, and was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1992) <i>and</i> writing. His first book, <I>Setting Free the Bears</I>, was published in 1968 to respectable reviews but sold poorly. Over the course of the next ten years, he wrote two more unsuccessful novels (<i>The Water-Method Man</I> and <i>The 158-Pound Marriage</i>).<p>    Then, in 1978, Irving hit the jackpot with <i>The World According to Garp</I>, a freewheeling comic saga incorporating motifs he would revisit many times over -- feminism, adultery, violence, grotesquerie, and an overriding sense of impending doom. <i>Garp</i> received a National Book Award nomination and became an instant cult classic. It also paved the way for a string of bestsellers, including <i>The Hotel New Hampshire</i>, <i>The Cider House Rules</I>, <i>A Prayer for Owen Meaney</I>, and <i>The Fourth Hand</I>, to name a few.<p>     While none of his novels are strictly autobiographical, Irving has never denied that certain elements from his life have seeped into his books, most notably the pervading "presence" of his biological father, John Wallace Blunt, a man Irving never knew. Raised by his mother and a stepfather he loved dearly, Irving had denied for years any curiosity about his absent parent, but the figure of the missing father haunted his writing like a specter. In 2005, he laid the ghost to rest with the publication of <i>Until I Find You</I>, a searing story that took shape slowly and painfully over the better part of a decade. Writing the novel also allowed the author to wrestle with a closely guarded secret from his past -- just like the novel's protagonist Jack Burns, Irving was sexually abused as a preteen by an older woman. In an eerily timed coincidence, while he was crafting the novel, Irving was contacted by a man named Chris Blunt, who identified himself as the son of Irving's biological father. Twenty years younger than Irving, his half-brother told Irving that their father had died in 1995. Although Irving was devastated by the experience, he now feels as if he is able to turn the page and move on.<p>    In addition to his novels, Irving has also written a collection of short stories and essays (1995's <i>Trying to Save Piggy Sneed</I>) and several screenplays, including his Oscar-winning adaptation of <i>The Cider House Rules</I>. He chronicled the experience of bringing his novel to the screen in the 1999 memoir <i>My Movie Business</I>.</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><li><b>Irving struggled in school</b> with a learning disability that was probably undiagnosed dyslexia. Today, he considers it something of a blessing. Forced to read slowly, he savored each word and literally fell in love with language and literature.<p>     <li><b>In a 2001 interview</b> with the now-defunct <i>Book</i> magazine, Irving confessed, "The characters in my novels, from the very first one, are always on some quixotic effort of attempting to control something that is uncontrollable -- some element of the world that is essentially random and out of control."<p>    <li><b>Although the results have been mixed at best,</b> film versions have been made of several Irving novels, including <i>The World According to Garp</I>, <I>The Hotel New Hampshire</I>, and <i>The Cider House Rules</i>, which won for Irving a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. In addition, the movie <i>Simon Birch</I> was loosely based on <i>A Prayer for Owen Meaney</I>, and the first third of Irving's novel <i>A Widow for One Year</I> became the acclaimed film <i>The Door in the Floor</I>.<p>    <li><b>One of Irving's great literary influences</b> was Kurt Vonnegut, his teacher and mentor at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The two writers remained close friends until Vonnegut's death in 2007.<p>    <li><b>Irving has two tattoos:</b> a maple leaf (in honor of his Canadian wife) on his left shoulder, and the starting circle of a wrestling match on his right forearm.<p>    <li><b>The influence of Charles Dickens</b> is evident in Irving's novels, sprawling epics with huge casts of colorful, eccentric characters and lots of complex plot points that crop up, disappear for hundreds of pages, then resurface unexpectedly. He writes voluminously and in great detail; he refuses to use a computer; and he begins at the end, writing the last sentence of each novel first. He describes himself as a craftsman and claims that he owes his success more to rewrites, ruthless editing, and infinite patience than to artistic genius.<p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>In 1954, in the cookhouse of a logging and sawmill settlement in northern New Hampshire, an anxious twelve-year-old boy mistakes the local constable&#8217;s girlfriend for a bear.

								Michiko Kakutani</h3><p>Mr. Irving uses coincidences, cliffhanger chapter endings and other 19th-century novelistic devices to hook the reader, while at the same time orchestrating them to underscore the improbable, random nature of real life. Some of his inventions&#8230;are ludicrous at first glance, but the reader gradually comes to understand that they are writerly metaphors for the precarious nature of life in "a world of accidents," that the volume we hold in our hands is, in fact, the creation of Danny, who is trying to make sense of the unlikely trajectory of his life through the act of writing. In this respect <i>Last Night in Twisted River</i> emerges not just as a tall tale, but also as an entertaining, if messy and long-winded, commentary on the fiction-making process itself.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Irving (The World According to Garp) returns with a scattershot novel, the overriding themes, locations and sensibilities of which will probably neither surprise longtime fans nor win over the uninitiated. Dominic &ldquo;Cookie&rdquo; Baciagalupo and his son, Danny, work the kitchen of a New Hampshire logging camp overlooking the Twisted River, whose currents claimed both Danny's mother and, as the novel opens, mysterious newcomer Angel Pope. Following an Irvingesque appearance of bears, Cookie and Danny's &ldquo;world of accidents&rdquo; expands, precipitating a series of adventures both literary and culinary. The ensuing 50-year slog follows the Baciagalupos from a Boston Italian restaurant to an Iowa City Chinese joint and finally a Toronto French cafe, while dovetailing clumsily with Danny's career as the distinctly Irving-like writer Danny Angel. The story's vicariousness is exacerbated by frequent changes of scene, self-conscious injections of how writers must &ldquo;detach themselves&rdquo; and a cast of invariably flat characters. With conflict this meandering and characters this limp, reflexive gestures come off like nostalgia and are bound to leave readers wishing Irving had detached himself even more. (Oct.)
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Irving's 12th novel&mdash;following Until I Find You (2005), also available from Books on Tape and Random Audio&mdash;covers five decades in the lives of three highly memorable characters. Most of Irving's usual themes and icons appear here, from bears to wrestling to unseen fears, as he uses the character of a writer to define his own fiction writing process. Narrator Arthur Morey (The Ministry of Special Cases) shows an impressive grasp of the language in his reading of this father-son love story touched with loss and humor; he especially captures well the cantankerous logger Ketchum, who serves as the book's political compass. Long and demanding but highly worth it; recommended for contemporary fiction audiences. [The New York Times best-selling Random hc was described as being "interesting, funny, and original," LJ 11/1/09; the pb will release in June 2010.&mdash;Ed.]&mdash;Joyce Kessel, Villa Maria Coll., Buffalo
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Irving's new doorstopper (Until I Find You, 2006, etc.) addresses a strong theme-the role accident plays in even the most carefully planned and managed lives-but doesn't always stick to the subject. His logjam of a narrative focuses on the life and times of Danny Baciagalupo, who navigates the roiling waters of growing up alongside his widowed father Dominic, a crippled logging-camp cook employed by a company that plies its dangerous trade along the zigzag Twisted River, north of New Hampshire's Androscoggin River in Robert Frost's old neighborhood of Coos County. The story begins swiftly and compellingly in 1954, when a river accident claims the life of teenaged Canadian sawmill worker Angel Pope, whom none of his co-workers really know. Irving's characters live in a "world of accidents" whose by-products include Dominic's maiming and the death of his young wife in a mishap similar to Angel's. All is nicely done throughout the novel's assured and precisely detailed early pages. But trouble looms and symbols clash when Danny mistakenly thinks a constable's lady friend is a bear, and admirers of The Cider House Rules (1985) and A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989) will anticipate that Large Meanings prowl these dark woods. The narrative flattens out as we follow the Baciagalupos south to Boston, thence to Iowa (where we're treated to a lengthy account of Danny's studies, surely not unlike Irving's own, at the Iowa Writers' Workshop), and an enormity of specifics and generalizations about Danny's career as bestselling author "Danny Angel." The tale spans 50 years, and Danny's/Irving's penchant for commentary on the psyche, obligations and disappointments of the writer's life makes those yearsfeel like centuries. Will entertain the faithful and annoy readers who think this author has already written the same novel too many times.

Dear Readers,<br><br>

In January 2005, I was driving north to Rutland, Vermont, on a snowy road. An old Bob Dylan song was yowling away on the car CD-player.
<br><br>
I was thinking about my next novel, my twelfth. It's about a cook and his son. They live in a rough place, a sawmill and logging-camp kind of town. Something awful happens; they have to leave town in a hurry. But something else happens later; the cook's son is compelled to go back to the town he and his father ran away from. That's all I knew. I didn't know what made the son return to the scene of the crime, or what made the father and son leave in the first place. The Bob Dylan song on my car CD-player was "Tangled Up in Blue." I've probably heard that song a hundred times, but on that cold, early morning one stanza jumped out at me.<br><br>

"I had a job in the great north woods / Working as a cook for a spell / But I never did like it all that much / And one day the ax just fell."
<br><br>
By the time I got to Rutland, I knew the last sentence of my novel -- that's where I begin a book, with the last sentence. From there, I work my way back to where the story begins. In eleven out of twelve novels, the last sentence has come first.<br><br>

I wrote the last sentence of my next novel on a pad of prescription paper in my orthopaedic surgeon's office. Here it is: "He felt that the great adventure of his life was just beginning -- as his father must have felt, in the throes and dire circumstances of his last night in Twisted River."<br><br>

And there, too, of course, was the novel's title: <i>Last Night in Twisted River</i>.<br><br>

--<i>John Irving</i><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><b>I. <br>
COOS COUNTY, <br>
NEW HAMPSHIRE, 1954 </b><br><br>

C H A P T E R 1 <br>
UNDER THE LOGS <br><br>
The young canadian, who could not have been more 
than fifteen, had hesitated too long. For a frozen moment, his feet had 
stopped moving on the floating logs in the basin above the river bend; 
he'd slipped entirely underwater before anyone could grab his outstretched 
hand. One of the loggers had reached for the youth's long 
hair-the older man's fingers groped around in the frigid water, which 
was thick, almost soupy, with sloughed-off slabs of bark. Then two 
logs collided hard on the would-be rescuer's arm, breaking his wrist. 
The carpet of moving logs had completely closed over the young 
Canadian, who never surfaced; not even a hand or one of his boots 
broke out of the brown water. <p></p>
Out on a logjam, once the key log was pried loose, the river drivers 
had to move quickly and continually; if they paused for even a second 
or two, they would be pitched into the torrent. In a river drive, death 
among moving logs could occur from a crushing injury, before you 
had a chance to drown-but drowning was more common. <p></p>
From the riverbank, where the cook and his twelve-year-old son 
could hear the cursing of the logger whose wrist had been broken, it 
was immediately apparent that someone was in more serious trouble 
than the would-be rescuer, who'd freed his injured arm and had managed 
to regain his footing on the flowing logs. His fellow river drivers 
ignored him; they moved with small, rapid steps toward shore, calling 
out the lost boy's name. The loggers ceaselessly prodded with their 
pike poles, directing the floating logs ahead of them. The rivermen 
were, for the most part, picking the safest way ashore, but to the cook's 
hopeful son it seemed that they might have been trying to create a gap 
of sufficient width for the young Canadian to emerge. In truth, there 
were now only intermittent gaps between the logs. The boy who'd told 
them his name was "Angel Pope, from Toronto," was that quickly 
gone. <p></p>
"Is it Angel?" the twelve-year-old asked his father. This boy, with 
his dark-brown eyes and intensely serious expression, could have been 
mistaken for Angel's younger brother, but there was no mistaking the 
family resemblance that the twelve-year-old bore to his ever-watchful 
father. The cook had an aura of controlled apprehension about him, as 
if he routinely anticipated the most unforeseen disasters, and there 
was something about his son's seriousness that reflected this; in fact, 
the boy looked so much like his father that several of the woodsmen 
had expressed their surprise that the son didn't also walk with his dad's 
pronounced limp. <p></p>
The cook knew too well that indeed it was the young Canadian 
who had fallen under the logs. It was the cook who'd warned the loggers 
that Angel was too green for the river drivers' work; the youth 
should not have been trying to free a logjam. But probably the boy had 
been eager to please, and maybe the rivermen hadn't noticed him at 
first. <p></p>
In the cook's opinion, Angel Pope had also been too green (and too 
clumsy) to be working in the vicinity of the main blade in a sawmill. 
That was strictly the sawyer's territory -- a highly skilled position in 
the mills. The planer operator was a relatively skilled position, too, 
though not particularly dangerous. <p></p>
The more dangerous and less skilled positions included working 
on the log deck, where logs were rolled into the mill and onto the saw 
carriage, or unloading logs from the trucks. Before the advent of mechanical 
loaders, the logs were unloaded by releasing trip bunks on the 
sides of the trucks-this allowed an entire load to roll off a truck at 
once. But the trip bunks sometimes failed to release; the men were occasionally caught under a cascade of logs while they were trying to 
free a bunk. <p></p>
As far as the cook was concerned, Angel shouldn't have been in any 
position that put the boy in close proximity to moving logs. But the 
lumberjacks had been as fond of the young Canadian as the cook and 
his son had been, and Angel had said he was bored working in the 
kitchen. The youth had wanted more physical labor, and he liked the 
outdoors. <p></p>
The repeated thunk-thunk of the pike poles, poking the logs, was 
briefly interrupted by the shouts of the rivermen who had spotted 
Angel's pike pole-more than fifty yards from where the boy had vanished. <p></p>
The fifteen-foot pole was floating free of the log drive, out 
where the river currents had carried it away from the logs. 
The cook could see that the river driver with the broken wrist had 
come ashore, carrying his pike pole in his good hand. First by the familiarity 
of his cursing, and only secondarily by the logger's matted 
hair and tangled beard, did the cook realize that the injured man was 
Ketchum-no neophyte to the treachery of a log drive. <p></p>
It was April -- not long after the last snowmelt and the start of mud 
season -- but the ice had only recently broken up in the river basin, the 
first logs falling through the ice upstream of the basin, on the Dummer 
ponds. The river was ice-cold and swollen, and many of the lumberjacks 
had heavy beards and long hair, which would afford them some 
scant protection from the blackflies in mid-May. <p></p>
Ketchum lay on his back on the riverbank like a beached bear. The 
moving mass of logs flowed past him. It appeared as if the log drive 
were a life raft, and the loggers who were still out on the river seemed 
like castaways at sea -- except that the sea, from one moment to the 
next, turned from greenish brown to bluish black. The water in 
Twisted River was richly dyed with tannins. <p></p>
"Shit, Angel!" Ketchum shouted from his back. "I said, 'Move your 
feet, Angel. You have to keep moving your feet!' Oh, shit." <p></p>
The vast expanse of logs had been no life raft for Angel, who'd 
surely drowned or been crushed to death in the basin above the river 
bend, although the lumberjacks (Ketchum among them) would follow 
the log drive at least to where Twisted River poured into the Pontook
Reservoir at Dead Woman Dam. The Pontook Dam on the Androscoggin 
River had created the reservoir; once the logs were let 
loose in the Androscoggin, they would next encounter the sorting 
gaps outside Milan. In Berlin, the Androscoggin dropped two hundred 
feet in three miles; two paper mills appeared to divide the river at 
the sorting gaps in Berlin. It was not inconceivable to imagine that 
young Angel Pope, from Toronto, was on his way there. <p></p>
Come nightfall, the cook and his son were still attempting to 
salvage leftovers, for tomorrow's meals, from the scores of untouched 
dinners in the small settlement's dining lodge -- the cookhouse in the 
so-called town of Twisted River, which was barely larger and only a 
little less transient than a logging camp. Not long ago, the only dining 
lodge on a river drive hadn't been a lodge at all. There once was a traveling 
kitchen that had been permanently built onto a truck body, and 
an adjacent truck on which a modular dining hall could be taken 
down and reassembled -- this was when the trucks used to perpetually 
move camp to another site on Twisted River, wherever the loggers 
were working next. <p></p>
In those days, except on the weekends, the rivermen rarely went 
back to the town of Twisted River to eat or sleep. The camp cook had 
often cooked in a tent. Everything had to be completely portable; 
even the sleeping shelters were built onto truck bodies. 
Now nobody knew what would become of the less-than-thriving 
town of Twisted River, which was situated partway between the river 
basin and the Dummer ponds. The sawmill workers and their families 
lived there, and the logging company maintained bunkhouses for the 
more transient woodsmen, who included not only the French Canadian 
itinerants but most of the river drivers and the other loggers. The 
company also maintained a better equipped kitchen, an actual dining 
lodge- the aforementioned cookhouse -- for the cook and his son. 
But for how much longer? Not even the owner of the logging company 
knew. <p></p>
The lumber industry was in transition; it would one day be possible 
for every worker in the logging business to work from home. The 
logging camps (and even the slightly less marginal settlements like 
Twisted River) were dying. The wanigans themselves were disappearing; those curious shelters for sleeping and eating and storing equipment 
had not only been mounted on trucks, on wheels, or on crawler 
tracks, but they were often attached to rafts or boats.<p></p> 
The Indian dishwasher -- she worked for the cook -- had long ago 
told the cook's young son that <i>wanigan</i> was from an Abenaki word, 
leading the boy to wonder if the dishwasher herself was from the 
Abenaki tribe. Perhaps she just happened to know the origin of the 
word, or she'd merely claimed to know it. (The cook's son went to 
school with an Indian boy who'd told him that <i>wanigan</i> was of Algonquian origin.) <p></p>
While it lasted, the work during a river drive was from dawn till 
dark. It was the protocol in a logging operation to feed the men four 
times a day. In the past, when the wanigans couldn't get close to a river 
site, the two midday meals had been trekked to the drivers. The first 
and last meal were served in the base camp- nowadays, in the dining 
lodge. But out of their affection for Angel, tonight many of the loggers 
had missed their last meal in the cookhouse. They'd spent the 
evening following the log drive, until the darkness had driven them 
away -- not only the darkness, but also the men's growing awareness 
that none of them knew if Dead Woman Dam was open. From the 
basin below the town of Twisted River, the logs -- probably with 
Angel among them -- might already have flowed into the Pontook 
Reservoir, but not if Dead Woman Dam was closed. And if the Pontook 
Dam and Dead Woman were open, the body of the young Canadian 
would be headed pell-mell down the Androscoggin. No one 
knew better than Ketchum that there would likely be no finding 
Angel there. <p></p>
The cook could tell when the river drivers had stopped searching-from the kitchen's screen door, he could hear them leaning their pike 
poles against the cookhouse. A few of the tired searchers found their 
way to the dining lodge after dark; the cook didn't have the heart to turn 
them away. The hired help had all gone home -- everyone but the Indian 
dishwasher, who stayed late most nights. The cook, whose difficult 
name was Dominic Baciagalupo -- or "Cookie," as the lumberjacks routinely 
called him -- made the men a late supper, which his twelve-year-old 
son served. <p></p>
"Where's Ketchum?" the boy asked his dad. <p></p>

"He's probably getting his arm fixed," the cook replied. <p></p>
"I'll bet he's hungry," the twelve-year-old said, "but Ketchum is 
wicked tough." <p></p>
"He's impressively tough for a drinking man," Dominic agreed, but 
he was thinking that maybe Ketchum wasn't tough enough for this. 
Losing Angel Pope might be hardest on Ketchum, the cook thought, 
because the veteran logger had taken the young Canadian under his 
wing. He'd looked after the boy, or he had tried to. <p></p>
Ketchum had the blackest hair and beard-the charred-black 
color of charcoal, blacker than a black bear's fur. He'd been married 
young-and more than once. He was estranged from his children, 
who had grown up and gone their own ways. Ketchum lived year-round 
in one of the bunkhouses, or in any of several run-down hostelries, 
if not in a wanigan of his own devising-namely, in the back of 
his pickup truck, where he had come close to freezing to death on 
those winter nights when he'd passed out, dead drunk. Yet Ketchum 
had kept Angel away from alcohol, and he'd kept not a few of the 
older women at the so-called dance hall away from the young Canadian, 
too. <p></p>
"You're too young, Angel," the cook had heard Ketchum tell the 
youth. "Besides, you can catch things from those ladies." 
Ketchum would know, the cook had thought. Dominic knew that 
Ketchum had done more damage to himself than breaking his wrist in 
a river drive. <p></p>
The steady hiss and intermittent flickering of the pilot lights on 
the gas stove in the cookhouse kitchen -- an old Garland with two 
ovens and eight burners, and a flame-blackened broiler above -- seemed perfectly in keeping with the lamentations of the loggers over 
their late supper. They had been charmed by the lost boy, whom they'd 
adopted as they would a stray pet. The cook had been charmed, too. 
Perhaps he saw in the unusually cheerful teenager some future incarnation 
of his twelve-year-old son-for Angel had a welcoming expression 
and a sincere curiosity, and he exhibited none of the withdrawn 
sullenness that appeared to afflict the few young men his age in a rough 
and rudimentary place like Twisted River. 
<p></p>
This was all the more remarkable because the youth had told them 
that he'd recently run away from home.<p></p> 
"You're Italian, aren't you?" Dominic Baciagalupo had asked the 
boy.<p></p>
"I'm not from Italy, I don't speak Italian -- you're not much of an 
Italian if you come from Toronto," Angel had answered. <p></p>
The cook had held his tongue. Dominic knew a little about Boston 
Italians; some of them seemed to have issues regarding how Italian 
they were. And the cook knew that Angel, in the old country, might 
have been an Angelo. (When Dominic had been a little boy, his 
mother had called him Angel�-in her Sicilian accent, this sounded 
like an-geh-LOO.)<p></p> 
But after the accident, nothing with Angel Pope's written name 
could be found; among the boy's few belongings, not a single book or 
letter identified him. If he'd had any identification, it had gone into 
the river basin with him -- probably in the pocket of his dungarees -- and if they never located the body, there would be no way to inform 
Angel's family, or whoever the boy had run away from. <p></p>
Legally or not, and with or without proper papers, Angel Pope had 
made his way across the Canadian border to New Hampshire. Not the 
way it was usually done, either-Angel hadn't come from Quebec. 
He'd made a point of arriving from Ontario -- he was not a French 
Canadian. The cook hadn't once heard Angel speak a word of French 
or Italian, and the French Canadians at the camp had wanted nothing 
to do with the runaway boy -- apparently, they didn't like English 
Canadians. Angel, for his part, kept his distance from the French; he 
didn't appear to like the Qu�b�cois any better than they liked him. 
Dominic had respected the boy's privacy; now the cook wished 
he knew more about Angel Pope, and where he'd come from. Angel 
had been a good-natured and fair-minded companion for the cook's 
twelve-year-old son, Daniel-or Danny, as the loggers and the saw-mill men called the boy.<p></p> 
Almost every male of working age in Twisted River knew the cook 
and his son- some women, too. Dominic had needed to know a number 
of women-mainly, to help him look after his son-for the cook 
had lost his wife, Danny's young mother, a long-seeming decade ago. 
Dominic Baciagalupo believed that Angel Pope had had some experience 
with kitchen work, which the boy had done awkwardly but 
uncomplainingly, and with an economy of movement that must have 
been born of familiarity -- despite his professed boredom with 
cooking-related chores, and his penchant for cutting himself on the 
cutting board. <p></p>
Moreover, the young Canadian was a reader; he'd borrowed many 
books that had belonged to Dominic's late wife, and he often read 
aloud to Daniel. It was Ketchum's opinion that Angel had read Robert 
Louis Stevenson to young Dan "to excess" -- not only <i>Kidnapped</i> and 
<i>Treasure Island</i> but his unfinished deathbed novel, <i>St. Ives,</i> which 
Ketchum said should have died with the author. At the time of the accident 
on the river, Angel had been reading <i>The Wrecker</i> to Danny. 
(Ketchum had not yet weighed in with his opinion of that novel.) 
Well, whatever Angel Pope's background had been, he'd had some 
schooling, clearly-more than most of the French Canadian woodsmen 
the cook had known. (More than most of the sawmill workers 
and the local woodsmen, too.)<p></p> 
"Why did Angel have to die?" Danny asked his dad. The twelve-year-old was helping his father wipe down the dining tables after the 
late-arriving loggers had gone off to bed, or perhaps to drink. And although 
she often kept herself busy in the cookhouse quite late into the 
night, at least well past Danny's bedtime, the Indian dishwasher had 
finished with her chores; by now, she'd driven her truck back to town.<p></p> 
"Angel didn't have to die, Daniel-it was an avoidable accident."<p></p> 
The cook's vocabulary often made reference to avoidable accidents, 
and his twelve-year-old son was overfamiliar with his father's grim 
and fatalistic thoughts on human fallibility -- the recklessness of 
youth, in particular. "He was too green to be out on a river drive," the 
cook said, as if that were all there was to it. <p></p>
Danny Baciagalupo knew his dad's opinion of all the things Angel, 
or any boy that age, was too green to do. The cook also would have 
wanted to keep Angel far away from a peavey. (The peavey's most important 
feature was the hinged hook that made it possible to roll a 
heavy log by hand. ) <p></p>
According to Ketchum, the "old days" had been more perilous. 
Ketchum claimed that working with the horses, pulling the scoots out 
of the winter woods, was risky work. In the winter, the lumberjacks 
tramped up into the mountains. They'd cut down the trees and (not 
that long ago) used horses to pull the timber out, one log at a time. 
The scoots, or wheelless drays, were dragged like sleds on the frozen 
snow, which not even the horses' hooves could penetrate because the 
sled ruts on the horse-haul roads were iced down every night. Then 
the snowmelt and mud season came, and-"back then," as Ketchum 
would say -- all the work in the woods was halted. <p></p>
But even this was changing. Since the new logging machinery 
could work in muddy conditions and haul much longer distances to 
improved roads, which could be used in all seasons, mud season itself 
was becoming less of an issue -- and horses were giving way to crawler 
tractors. <p></p>
The bulldozers made it possible to build a road right to a logging 
site, where the wood could be hauled out by truck. The trucks moved 
the wood to a more central drop point on a river, or on a pond or lake; 
in fact, highway transport would very soon supplant the need for river 
drives. Gone were the days when a snubbing winch had been used to 
ease the horses down the steeper slopes. "The teams could slide on 
their haunches," Ketchum had told young Dan. (Ketchum rated oxen 
highly, for their steady footing in deep snow, but oxen had never been 
widely used.) <p></p>
Gone, too, was railroad logging in the woods; it came to an end in 
the Pemigewasset Valley in '48 -- the same year one of Ketchum's 
cousins had been killed by a Shay locomotive at the Livermore Falls 
paper mill. The Shay weighed fifty tons and had been used to pull the 
last of the rails from the woods. The former railroad beds made for 
firm haul roads for the trucks in the 1950s, although Ketchum could 
still remember a murder on the Beebe River Railroad --  back when he'd 
been the teamster for a bobsled loaded with prime virgin spruce behind 
a four -- horse rig. Ketchum had been the teamster on one of the early 
Lombard steam engines, too-the one steered by a horse. The horse 
had turned the front sled runners, and the teamster sat at the front of 
the log hauler; later models replaced the horse and teamster with a 
helmsman at a steering wheel. Ketchum had been a helmsman, too, 
Danny Baciagalupo knew -- clearly, Ketchum had done everything.
