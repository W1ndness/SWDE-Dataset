No more following in her six older sisters' footsteps. No more going to class with kids who've seen her grandma doing jujitsu in the front yard next to the headstones of her four dead husbands. And no more worrying about keeping her deep, dark secret hidden. </p> <p> Sparrow makes a new best friend and has her eye on an irritatingly appealing guy in her history class. She feels like she's well on her way to a normal life. But it's another boy&#8212;a dead one&#8212;who wants Sparrow's attention, and he won't let her be till she's helped him Move On. </p> <p> You see, Sparrow Delaney's secret is that she's a psychic. And there's one very persistent ghost who won't let her forget it. </p>
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Harper's (<I>Boitano's Edge</I>) polished debut novel couches an unexpectedly poignant meditation on loss in a quick-moving plot about ghosts and the spiritual mediums who communicate with them. Fifteen-year-old Sparrow Delaney is the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter and therefore highly gifted in the psychic arts. The only problem: she wants nothing to do with her talent. She trains herself to ignore the ghosts that compete for her attention, at least in the presence of her family and fellow citizens of Lily Dale, N.Y., a (real-life) town that attracts tourists with its famous spiritualists and Spirit meetings. But how can Sparrow shake off the teenage ghost who refuses to stop haunting her unless she helps him, and what does he have to do with the cute boy in the new school she's transferred to in hopes of escaping the Lily Dale weirdness? A steady stream of wit refreshes familiar-seeming story elements. Harper serves up pitch-perfect dialogue from high school athletes and teachers; squabbling mediums; and such clever flourishes as the grandfatherly baker, the 19th-century young Indian gentleman and the exacting female professor who serve as Sparrow's spirit guides. Surprise turns add to the plot's pleasures, but what makes this book stand out most is Harper's attention to the pockets of sorrow in her characters' histories, each of them handled with care. For all of the imagination the author displays in inventing a spirit world, she shows equal skill in probing the nuances of tender emotions, too.

											The only reason I purchased The Secret Life of Sparrow Delaney was because Barnes and Noble had it on sale. I expected the book to be just ok and probably one I would just finish and move on from. I was pleasantly surprised though, when the book far exceeded my expectations. Sparrow is a relatable character who doesn't fall into the stereotypical gender role. This book is not only a fun, easy read for teens, but young adults and even adults as well. The Secret Life of Sparrow Delaney is has humor, and other emotions. The writing makes you smile or laugh at times, and feel the sadness of events at others. Great Read :)</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/My-Soul-to-Save/Rachel-Vincent/e/9780373210046/?pv=y">My Soul to Save (Soul Screamers Series #2)</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Just-One-Wish/Janette-Rallison/e/9780399246180/?pv=y">Just One Wish</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Everlost/Neal-Shusterman/e/9780689872389/?pv=y">Everlost</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Taken-by-Storm/Angela-Morrison/e/9781595142740/?pv=y">Taken by Storm</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Way Better Than I Thought!<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1112323_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781616823917_BK_8_1112323" href="#previewReview_1112323" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>April 11, 2009: 
											When I took out this book I thought it looked alright, I didn't think it was going to be good.  But once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The topic about ghosts was so different and interesting. It was kind of predictable but it was well written. I thought that the ending was really nice.

</p><h3>Children's Literature</h3><p>Sparrow Delaney has a secret from the rest of her family. She can see and hear ghosts. She keeps this a secret, not because her family will not believe her, but because they will. Sparrow Delaney comes from a long line of psychics and, as she is the seventh daughter, she is supposed to be the most psychic of all. All Sparrow wants is to be normal and non-psychic. For years she has kept this secret from her family and refuses to talk to the ghosts who approach her, except for her three spirit guides. Now that Sparrow is starting at a new school, this is her chance to be completely normal, as no one will know her older psychic sisters. However, normal is not in the cards for Sparrow. A very insistent ghost will not leave her alone and pulls pranks like filling her locker with Jello until she will listen to him. When Sparrow discovers a link between the ghost and Jack, a very annoying and cute boy with whom she is partnered for history class, she is forced to reconsider her policy of not helping ghosts. While psychics abound in young adult literature, Sparrow Delaney stands out with her humor and unique problems, making this a fun, touching, supernatural adventure.
</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>Fifteen-year-old Sparrow is the youngest of seven sisters living with their mother and grandmother in Lily Dale-a town where spiritualism thrives. The women possess varied psychic powers and act as mediums, providing the family income. Sparrow denies to her family that she has any psychic abilities as she wishes to live "normally." She starts at a new high school where no one knows her or her family and is soon paired for a history project with Jack, a surly classmate. Jack chooses Lily Dale as the topic, and Sparrow must hide her connection to the town. Simultaneously Luke, the spirit of a seventeen-year-old boy, begins to visit Sparrow and beg for her help. She is drawn to him and his plight, especially after she discovers his connection to Jack. Ultimately Sparrow must decide whether it is more important to deny her gifts and be normal or accept who she is and aid a friend. The story is a bit overpopulated with offbeat characters; however, it gives the reader a sense of the mayhem in which Sparrow lives and illustrates her confusion about the direction of her life. Teen readers will identify with Sparrow's wish to fit in and will find this story to be neither too heavy nor too fanciful but an entertaining read.
</p><h3>KLIATT</h3><p>To quote the review of the hardcover in KLIATT, July 2007: There's no getting around it: Sparrow Delaney's family is eccentric. She, her six older sisters, her mother and her grandmother live together in an old house that contains one bathroom, four graves in the front yard, bamboo skulls on the porch�and a room for communicating with ghosts. That's because the Delaney family is one of the oldest families of mediums in the very old town of Lily Dale. Out of all the mysteries within her family, though, the biggest secret actually belongs to Sparrow. For the past 15 years, she has been consoling her family, who are sorry that her own psychic abilities seem to be nonexistent, in spite of her potential as the seventh child of a seventh child. She's been lying. The only "people" from whom Sparrow cannot hide her abilities are the spirits themselves, but up until her 15th birthday, she just ignored them: she has seen the impoverished, ridiculed life that comes from being a medium, and she wants no part of it. Then she meets Luke, a ghost who is haunting a mysterious (and very cute) boy in Sparrow's history class named Jack. As Sparrow gets to know both Luke and Jack, she wonders if she needs to rethink her stance on being a psychic after all. Sparrow Delaney is the sort of character who is exactly calculated to make the reader fall immediately and irrevocably in love with her, and the book's mystery-laden plot demands "just five more pages" of its reader all the way to its end. Harper alludes to <I>Pride and Prejudice</I> several times throughout the book, and any Jane Austen fan will appreciate the similarities between that story and this one (including a rather unexpected and satisfyingending!). With its masterful charm and superbly creative storyline, the only possible fault with this book is that Harper has not already written two or three sequels to it. Reviewer: Cara Chancellor
</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p><P>Gr 7-10 Sparrow Delaney, 15, lives in Lily Dale, NY, a town populated with mediums who generate income by "serving Spirit," or hosting s&eacute;ances. Her mother, grandmother, and six sisters are all professional channelers of the other realm. Sparrow has had the ability to see, smell, hear, and communicate with ghosts since she was five, but, much to her family's chagrin, she denies these talents. Embarrassed by her town, dubbed "Spookyville" by outsiders, the girl attends school a few miles away. When her history-project partner, moody and handsome Jack, wants to research Lily Dale, Sparrow hides her knowledge of the place. Then she begins to be haunted by a teenage ghost named Luke, who happens to be Jack's missing brother. Luke refuses to be ignored and insists on using Sparrow to send messages to the living. On the first anniversary of his disappearance, his family decides to hold a televised s&eacute;ance in Lily Dale. Despite her refusal to embrace her "gift," Sparrow reveals Luke's messages, resulting in varied emotions from his parents and the townspeople. Readers will enjoy this combination of mystery, adventure, and romance, with enticing twists and turns. Harper seems to have studied Spiritualism and the real town of Lily Dale rather well, creating an accurate atmosphere. The ending, although somewhat sappy, is touching and effective.-<I>Marie C. Hansen, New York Public Library</I> </P>
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>What high-school kid wants to be a freak, especially the kind who talks to dead people? Not Sparrow Delaney, which is why she's keeping the secret from her family of seven women, all skilled mediums, that she can see and talk to ghosts. Evidently, as the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter, she has a special psychic gift, but when the ghost of a teenage boy appears to her in her classroom and pleads for her help, she can't ignore him. The current abundance of supernatural and occult books usually have historical settings, but the clever twist in this offering casts Sparrow's family in contemporary time in Lily Dale, N.Y., a Spiritualist community. Early references to thrift stores and computers clue the reader as modern trappings enhance the confrontations and dilemmas between the dearly departed and the visionary living. Idiosyncratic sisters (all named for birds by their ornithologist father who's now missing), budding romance, a mysterious fatal accident and a live-wire grandmother all test Sparrow's own spirit as she faces her destiny. Sparrow's plight gives new meaning to "not a ghost of a chance"-an entertaining one. (Fiction. 12-16)

I pulled my pillow over my head to shut out the voices floating up from downstairs, but it didn't help. Tonight it was Grandma Bee, my mother, and my sister Oriole who were channeling messages from the Other Side. </p> <P> First I heard Grandma Bee. "I see an older woman. She's short, a little pudgy, her dentures don't fit well, and she's squinting. Looks like she has a migraine. Hmm. And maybe a touch of indigestion." </p> <P> Then the voice of my grandmother's visitor&#58; "That's my great-aunt Agatha! That's her to a tee!" </p> <P> "Hmmph." Grandma Bee loathes being interrupted. I can just imagine the irate glare she's leveling at her visitor. It's been months since we've had enough money to get my grandmother's glasses fixed, so they sit askew on her nose, one side held together with a large safety pin. The thick lenses magnify her eyes and make them look rather wild. The crooked tilt of the frames make her look slightly mad. The combination&#8212;plus Grandma Bee's death-ray stare&#8212;usually silences . . . well, everybody. </p> <P> This woman, however, kept gushing. "I can't get over it! It's absolutely uncanny! You've described her perfectly!" </p> <P> I knew what Grandma Bee would like to say&#58; Of <i>course</i> I've described her perfectly. I am after all a <i>professional medium</i>. And your great-aunt is standing <i>right here in front of me</i>. </p> <P> But it's not good business to snap at paying customers, so she contented herself with a louder <i>hmmph</i> and an irritable clack of her dentures before continuing. "NowI'm getting something else. . . . Oh, she says you're not using enough salt when you make her potato soup." A note of boredom entered Grandma Bee's voice. She hates it when ghosts talk about recipes; she only deigns to turn on the stove when she wants to brew some of her homemade weed killer. "And she says to add some bacon grease, for heaven's sake. A little fat won't kill you." </p> <P> "Oh, <i>thank</i> you!" The visitor sighed happily at this seasoning tip from beyond the grave. "Would it be all right if I asked just one more little question? It's about the number of onions she said to use. . . ." </p> <P> I threw my pillow on the floor and gave a huge, irritable yawn. Earlier in the evening I had sat at my bedroom window and peered down at tonight's visitors as they walked up our cracked front sidewalk.

Tomorrow was my fifteenth birthday&#8212;undoubtedly the begining of a new and brilliant future!&#8212;and right after that was the first day of school.
