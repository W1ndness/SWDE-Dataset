When the group makes an astonishing find, an ancient animal encased in solid ice that appears to a giant cat, the parent company quickly plans the ultimate spectacle�the animal will be cut from the ice, thawed, and revealed on live television. Ignoring the dire warnings of a local Eskimo group, the scientists make one more horrifying discovery&#58; the beast is no cat�it�s an ancient killing machine. And it may not be dead.<br><br><br><i>From the Compact Disc edition.</i></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>In this taut, suspenseful SF thriller from bestseller Child (<I>Deep Storm</I>), an obscure scientific expedition in Alaska's remote Federal Wilderness Zone stumbles on the frozen body of what appears to be a saber-tooth tiger in a cave, though only the eyes are clearly visible through the ice. When news of the find reaches the cable television network sponsoring the expedition, Emilio Conti, a legendary documentary filmmaker, rushes to the scene, where he plans to film the thawing of the animal on live TV. After the frozen creature disappears, Conti suspects sabotage, until horribly eviscerated corpses begin to pile up at the military base hosting the expedition. Paleoecologist Evan Marshall suspects that the prehistoric beast is responsible-and that the initial identification of it as a saber-tooth was mistaken. While the story line of a horrific monster picking off a shrinking group of survivors in a confined area is nothing new, Child's superior writing raises this above the pack. <I>(Feb.)</I></P>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

											Like all of Lincoln Child's books, they're good escapism reading but predictable and easily forgetable. Not the type of books you'd spend the money for in hardcover but paperbacks are ok. His characters are pretty sterotypical, there's always the element of good vs. evil (good ends up winning of course); a supernatural type of force; the good/likeable characters survive; the bad guys don't. His plots are basically all the same and interchangeable. Personally, I like his books done with Douglas Preston better, but Child does these escapism books ok and they're good for a long, rainy weekend.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/37160000/37161104.JPG" alt="" height="138" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Lincoln Child</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Westport, Connecticut</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A., Carleton College, 1979</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.prestonchild.com">* Lincoln Child's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Born in Westport, CT, in 1958, Preston Child grew up with a consuming interest in writing. (On his website, he acknowledges several short stories from his youth and two "exquisitely embarrassing" novels penned in high school -- and currently kept under lock  and key!) He graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota with a degree in English. In 1979,  he moved to New York to pursue a career in publishing and was hired by St. Martin's Press as an editorial assistant. By 1984, he had worked his way up to full editor. <p>     It was around this time that Child met Douglas Preston, a writer employed by the American Museum of Natural History. Author and editor bonded while working together on the nonfiction book <I>Dinosaurs in the Attic</I>; and when the project ended, Preston treated Child to a private midnight tour of the AMNH. The excursion proved fateful: Exploring the deserted corridors and darkened nooks and crannies of the museum, Child turned to Preston and said, "This would make the perfect setting for a thriller!" Although the book would not see print until 1995, the idea for <I>Relic</I> was born that night, cementing a friendship and launching a unique cross-country writing partnership. <p>    Child left St. Martin's in 1987 to went to work for MetLife as a systems analyst. Shortly after the publication of <I>Relic,</I> he resigned his position to become a full-time writer. Subsequent collaborations with Preston have produced an intriguing string of interconnected novels that are less a series than what the authors call  a "pangea." The books are self-contained, but the stories take place in the same universe and they share events and characters -- including many introduced in <I>Relic</I>. Readers obviously enjoy this cross-pollination, since the Preston-Child thrillers turn up regularly on the bestseller charts. <p>    In 2002, Child released his first solo novel, <I>Utopia</I>, the story of a futuristic amusement park held hostage by a group of techno-terrorists. Other solo works have followed, blending cutting-edge science and high-octane thrills. Preston, too, has produced fiction and nonfiction on his own, and the two men continue  their successful collaborations. It's an arrangement that suits both writers to a tee. <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>While at St. Martin's, </b> Lincoln Child assembled several collections of ghost and horror stories. He also founded the company's mass-market horror division.<p>    <b>On his website, Child lists the following among his interests:</b> pre-1950s literature and poetry; post-1950s popular fiction; playing the piano, various MIDI instruments, and the 5-string banjo; English and American history; motorcycles; architecture; classical music, early jazz, blues, and R&B; exotic parrots; esoteric programming languages; mountain hiking; bow ties; Italian suits; fedoras; archaeology; and multiplayer deathmatching. <p>    <I>In our interview Child shared some fun and fascinating personal anecdotes.</I> <P>    <b>"I try to write about things, places, events, and phenomena</b> I know about personally. That helps make the novels more genuine. My grandmother, Nora Kubie, who was herself a published novelist, always gave me that advice. And it's probably the best I've received, or for that matter given. I even try to make use of my personal eccentricities and quirks. I hate subways, for example, and in such works as <I>Reliquary</I> I tried to instill -- or at least convey -- that groundless but persistent fear."<p>   <b>"My first job out of college was as an editorial assistant</b> in a New York publishing house. Being an editorial assistant is the purgatory would-be editors must endure before they can ascend the ladder and begin acquiring books on their own. I spent a year filing paperwork, writing copy, and typing rejection letters."<p>    <b>"For me, writing never gets easier.</b> It's always hard work. It doesn't matter how many words you wrote the day before, or how many novels you've completed in the last decade: every day you start fresh again with that same blank page, or that same blank screen. As long as the work, and the finished product, remains fresh and important to a writer -- and the day it stops being important to me is the day I'll lay down my pen -- said writer can never allow himself to coast, or go soft, or recycle old material, or take the easy way out."<p>    <b>"I like exotic parrots, motorcycles, wine</b> from Pauillac, playing the piano and the banjo, the poetry of John Keats, the music of Fats Waller, collecting old books and new guitars, computer FPS and RPG games, and preparing dishes like caneton a l'Orange and desserts like souffl� au chocolat."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2005, Lincoln Child took some time out to talk with us about favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><p>    Probably the essays of E. B. White. Nobody has influenced my love for words and wordplay as much as White has. In his hands, essays become poetry, and poetry becomes music. I've wanted to be a writer from a very young age, but it was such essays in this book as "Farewell, My Lovely!'" and "Death of a Pig" and "Here Is New York" that fueled my resolve, kept me determined despite setbacks and wrong turns, and ultimately helped turn a fond dream into reality.<p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><p>  This is hard. Ask me tomorrow, and you'd probably get some different titles. But these are the ones that spring immediately to mind: <p>    <li><I> Bleak House</I> by Charles Dickens -- I love all of Dickens's novels, but   <I>Bleak House</I> seems to me to be particularly dense, profound, and passionate. <p>    <li><I>The Complete Plays</I> by William Shakespeare -- What need I say? Shakespeare's plays are rich enough to reward many lifetimes of study: just ask Constance Greene. <p>    <li><I>Paradise Lost</I> by John Milton -- Music for the ear, grist for the mind, manna for the soul. <p>    <li><I>Moby-Dick</I> by Herman Melville -- Vast, sprawling, eccentric, self-absorbed. <I>Tristram Shandy</I> meets <I>Finnegan's Wake</I>. It would take a dozen readings to plumb Melville's full intent here -- and even that might not be enough. <p>    <li><I>Heart of Darkness</I> by Joseph Conrad -- A wonderfully moody, haunting, and thought-provoking book. Of the many journeys it recounts, the internal journey is by far the most fascinating and rewarding to me, at least. <p>    <li><I>The Norton Anthology of English Literature</I> (Third Edition) -- This anthology has probably been the single most important reading resource in my life. <p>    <li><I>The Outsider & Others</I> by H. P. Lovecraft -- The author's first (albeit posthumous) and biggest collection, containing almost all his best work. Impossible to find now, of course, so pick up any of the new Arkham House collections, particularly <I>Colour out of Space</I> or <I>At the Mountains of Madness</I>. Lovecraft is in my opinion the greatest writer of supernatural fiction ever and was hugely influential for me from grade school on. <p>    <li><I>The Silence of the Lambs</I> by Thomas Harris -- Sleek, stylish, and wonderfully written. This is not just a great modern thriller: it is a great modern novel.<p>    <li><I>The Andromeda Strain</I> by Michael Crichton -- When it comes to technothrillers, Crichton was there first, and he showed us all how it should be done. <p>    <li><I>The Thirteen Clocks</I> by James Thurber -- As playful, luminous, and mesmerizing a story as I've ever read. Charming for both children and adults. If, alas, you can find it.<p>    <li><I>Pet Sematary</I> by Stephen King -- Books just don't get much scarier than this. <p>      <b>What are some of your favorite films?</b><p>    I love everything from drawing-room comedies to modern thrillers to art-house films. My favorites include, in no particular order:<p>    <li><I>It Happened One Night</I><p>    <li><I>Green for Danger</I> -- Pendergast owes a lot to the detective in this movie, but good luck finding it.<p>    <li><I>The Man Who Came to Dinner</I><p>    <li><I>Rashomon</I><p>    <li><I>Psycho</I><p>    <li><I>The Philadelphia Story</I><p>    <li><I>The Seven Samurai</I><p>    <li><I>The Third Man</I><p>    <li><I>Alien</I><p>    <li><I>Aliens</I><p>    <li><I>Woman in the Dunes</I><p>    <li><I>Rear Window</I><p>    <li><I>Roxanne</I><p>    <li><I>Grand Illusion</I><p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><p>    I love many types of music: classical music, R&B, soul, rock, bluegrass, jazz. Of the last five categories, I'm particularly partial to music composed and performed between 1940 and 1970. I can't listen to music while writing -- any such distraction would have dreadful consequences.<p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><p>    Probably great works of English, Russian, and French literature. There are still many important novels in the canon that have to date eluded me -- the formal structure of a book club would help give me the discipline necessary to pick them up at last.<p>      <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><p>    I'm very hard to buy for. As a collector, my favorite books to receive are obviously collectible titles: rare first editions, very old books, and the like.<P>    As for giving books to others, any book that has had a profound effect on me, or that I think the recipient will truly enjoy, is a delight to pass on or recommend. I recently gave Doug a copy of Kenneth Roberts's <I>Northwest Passage</I>, and it helped him get through a grueling period of touring in support of our latest joint book. I think most readers would agree that recommending books to people can be almost as rewarding as discovering the book for yourself.<p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><p>    My desk is cluttered with computers, phones, fax machines, printers, network storage devices, keyboards, and flat panel displays -- all sorts of technological flotsam and jetsam.<p>    As for writing rituals, I find that late morning through early afternoon is the best time for me to do creative writing. I can only do so many hours of that per day, however, both from standpoints of creative energy and simple logistics: there are numerous other chores that demand a writer's time, such as answering email, doing publicity....<p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><p>    As a former book editor, I had contacts in the industry among agents and publishers. That guaranteed that our first novel, <I>Relic</I>, would at least be given a sympathetic reading -- but it certainly didn't guarantee success. Our agent showed that manuscript to a long, long list of publishers over many months, and he was very patient, keeping hope alive when both Doug Preston and I began to despair of the book ever being published. In the end, Tor Books took a chance on us.<p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><p>     Be patient, and have fun -- it sounds like a truism, but the act of writing should be, in part, its own reward. Doug and I tried to have fun while we wrote <I>Relic</I>, and we also tried hard to make it the kind of book that we ourselves would like to read. Readers are very intelligent people, and they are quick to spot the difference between a book that was written with the genuine intent of pleasing the author and his/her readers, and a book written with the cynical intention of simply selling a lot of copies.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>On an Arctic expedition to research the effects of global warming, paleoecologist Evan Marshall and his team make a discovery destined to make front-page headlines around the globe.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>In Child's latest (after his last solo effort, <i>Deep Storm</i>), scientists studying the effects of climate change in the Arctic Circle find frigid temperatures-and something more. While exploring an ice cave, the group uncovers the remains of a frozen saber-toothed tiger. When documentary filmmakers learn of the find, they come up north to record the discovery for a television special; then, the director has the bold idea to thaw the creature out on live TV for a ratings grab. When one of the scientists realizes that their discovery is bigger than the big cat, he tries to stop the unveiling, but the director is thinking of awards rather than everyone's well-being. Child excels in creating strong characters, isolating them, and forcing them to overcome impossible odds. Readers will be reminded of the film <i>The Thing</i>, but this book has more hard science to back up the chaos. Highly recommended for all public libraries. [See Prepub Alert, <i>LJ</i>9/15/08.]</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Furry prehistoric beast thaws, then makes up for lost meals with human victims. Paleoecologist Evan Marshall leads a group of scientists into "The Zone" in northeastern Alaska. Working out of a small base known as the Mount Fear Remote Sensing Installation, his team from Northern Massachusetts University is doing research on global warming. The only other humans around are a small number of Native Americans, Tunits, to the north. Beneath the ice floor in a cave, the team spots a frozen creature, two fist-sized yellow eyes surrounded by black pupils-perhaps, as the team believes, a saber-toothed tiger. When Usuguk, an elder of the Tunits, arrives to warn the team of evil and advise them to leave, Marshall politely but firmly refuses. Meanwhile, in Virginia, Dr. Jeremy Logan discovers some ominous, though unspecified, information about Fear Base in top-secret documents from the 1950s. More turmoil rocks The Zone with the arrival of brash Emilio Conti, an executive producer with a documentary film crew, big as Marshall's and twice as boisterous, that promptly sets up a makeshift adjoining camp. The only respectful filmmaker is attractive producer Kari Ekberg. Marshall tries to oust Conti and company, but the producer's smug announcement that the film has financed the entire expedition effectively neutralizes any objections. After Conti sets about melting the block of ice, the creature inside proves much larger than a cat, though it disappears before anyone gets a good look. Then the tastefully depicted carnage begins. As the body count rises, an ice-road trucker named Carradine boldly drives most of the cast to safety while Conti prepares to film the beast and Marshall seeks help from theTunits. Child (Deep Storm, 2007, etc.) depicts his frigid setting with greater authority than his characters, diminishing his thriller's impact. Far from a classic, but a minor-league Jurassic.

Lunch?"<br><br>Evan Marshall put the ziplock bag aside and stood up, massaging his lower back. He'd spent the last ninety minutes with his face inches above the ground, collecting samples from the glacial sediment, and it took his eyes a moment to adjust. The voice had been Sully's, and now Marshall made him out&#58; a squat, slightly portly figure in a fur-lined parka, standing, arms crossed, thirty yards up the steep valley. Behind him rose the terminal tongue of the Fear glacier, a rich, mysterious blue riddled with white fracture lines. Large ice boulders lay scattered along its base like so many monstrous diamonds, along with daggerlike shards of ancient lava. Marshall opened his mouth to warn Sully against standing so close&#58; the glacier was as dangerous as it was pretty, since the weather had turned warmer and the ice front was calving off deadly chunks at an unprecedented rate. Then he thought better of it. Gerard Sully was proud of his position as nominal leader and didn't like being told what to do. Instead, Marshall just shook his head. "I think I'll pass, thanks."<br><br>"Suit yourself." Sully turned toward Wright Faraday, the party's evolutionary biologist, who was busying himself a little downslope. "How's about it, Wright?"<br><br>Faraday glanced up, watery blue eyes oddly magnified behind tortoiseshell frames. A digital camera dangled from a heavy strap around his neck. "Not me," he said with a frown, as if the thought of stopping to eat in the middle of a workday was somehow heretical.<br><br>"Starve yourselves if you want to. Just don't ask me to bring anything back."<br><br>"Not even a Popsicle?" asked Marshall.<br><br>Sully smiled thinly. He was about as short as Napoleon, and radiated a combination of egotism and insecurity that Marshall found especially annoying. He'd been able to put up with it back at the university, where Sully was just one arrogant scientist among many, but up here on the ice&#151;with nowhere to escape&#151;it had grown irksome. Perhaps, he reflected, he should be relieved that their expedition had only a few weeks to play out.<br><br>"You look tired," Sully said. "Out walking again last night?"<br><br>Marshall nodded.<br><br>"You'd better be careful. You might fall into a lava tube and freeze to death."<br><br>"All right, Mom. I'll be careful."<br><br>"Or run into a polar bear, or something."<br><br>"That's all right. I'm starved for some good conversation."<br><br>"It's no joke, you refusing to carry a gun and all."<br><br>Marshall didn't like the direction this was leading. "Look, if you run into Ang, tell him I've got more samples here for transport back to the lab."<br><br>"I'll do that. He'll be thrilled."<br><br>Marshall watched the climatologist make his way carefully past them, down the rubble toward the foot of the mountain and their base. He called it "their base," but of course it belonged to the U.S. government&#58; officially known as the Mount Fear Remote Sensing Installation and decommissioned almost fifty years ago, it consisted of a low, gray, sprawling, _institutional-looking structure, festooned with radar domes and other detritus of the cold war. Beyond it lay a frigid landscape of permafrost and lava deposits spewed ages ago from the mountain's guts, gullied and split as if the earth had torn itself apart in geologic agony. In many places, the surface was hidden beneath large snowfields. There were no roads, no other structures, no living things. It was as hostile, as remote, as alien as the moon.<br><br>He stretched as he looked out over the forbidding landscape. Even after four weeks on-site, it still seemed hard to believe that anyplace could be so barren. But then the entire scientific expedition had seemed a little unreal from the start. Unreal that a media giant like Terra Prime had picked their grant applications for approval&#58; four scientists from Northern Massachusetts University with nothing in common save an interest in global warming. Unreal that the government had given them clearance to use Fear Base, _admittedly at significant expense and with strict limitations. And unreal that the warming trend itself was occurring with such breathtaking, frightening speed.<br><br>He turned away with a sigh. His knees hurt from hours of crouching over the terminal moraine, collecting samples. His fingertips and nose were half frozen. And to add insult to injury, the snow had turned to thin freezing sleet that was now slowly seeping through three layers of clothing and settling into the most intimate crevices of his person. But daylight was brief these days, and their expedition's window was fast closing. He was keenly aware of how little time he had left. There would be plenty of food back in Woburn, Massachusetts, and plenty of time to eat it.<br><br>As he turned to retrieve the sample bags, he heard Faraday speak again. "Five years ago, even two, I'd never believe it. Rain."<br><br>"It's not rain, Wright. It's sleet."<br><br>"Close enough. Rain in the Zone, with winter coming on? Unbelievable."<br><br>The "Zone" was a vast stretch of northeastern Alaska, hard against the Arctic Ocean, sandwiched between the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on one side and the Yukon's Ivvavik National Park on the other. It was a tract so cold and desolate that nobody wanted anything to do with it&#58; temperatures struggled to get above zero only a few months out of the year. Years ago, the government branded it the Federal Wilderness Zone and promptly forgot all about it. There were, Marshall reflected, probably no more than two dozen people in all its two million acres&#58; their own scientific team of five, the base's skeleton crew of four, a small band of Native Americans to the north, and a scattering of backpackers and loners who were too hard-core or eccentric to settle for anything but the most remote. How strange to think there were few people farther north on the planet than their little group.<br><br>A sudden, tremendous report, like the crack of a cannon, shook the glacial valley with the violence of an earthquake. The sound echoed across the tundra below them, violating the profound silence, bouncing back and forth like a tennis ball, growing slowly fainter as it receded into endless distance. Above, the face of the glacier had shorn away, tons of ice and snow adding to the frozen rubble lying along its forward edge. Marshall felt his heart lurch uncomfortably in his chest. No matter how many times he heard that sound, its violence always came as a shock.<br><br>Faraday pointed toward it. "See? That's exactly what I mean. A valley glacier like the Fear should taper to a nice, thin ice front, with a minimum of meltwater and a healthy percolation zone. But this one is calving like a tidewater glacier. I've been measuring the basal melt&#151;"<br><br>"That's Sully's job, not yours."<br><br>"&#151;and it's off the scale." Faraday shook his head. "Rain, unprecedented melting&#151;and there are other things happening, too. Like the northern lights the last few nights. You notice them?"<br><br>"Of course. A single color&#151;it was spectacular. And unusual."<br><br>"Unusual." Faraday repeated the word thoughtfully.<br><br>Marshall did not reply. In his experience, every scientific expedition, even one as small as this, had its Cassandra figure. Wright Faraday&#151;with his prodigious learning, his pessimistic outlook on life, his dark theories and outrageous predictions&#151;played the role expertly. Marshall gave the biologist a covert glance. Despite knowing him casually as a university colleague, and now having spent a month almost continually in his presence, he didn't really have a good idea what made the man tick.<br><br>Still&#151;Marshall thought as he filled and sealed a fresh bag, recorded the sample's location in a notebook, then measured and photographed the extraction site&#151;Faraday had a point. And that point was one reason he himself was collecting samples at an almost frantic pace. A glacier was a near-perfect place for his kind of research. During its formation, as it accumulated snow, it trapped organic remains&#58; pollen, plant fibers, animal remains. Later, as the glacier retreated, melting slowly away, it gracefully yielded up those secrets once again. This was an ideal gift for a paleoecologist, a treasure trove from the past.<br><br>Except there was nothing slow or graceful about this glacier's retreat. It was falling to pieces with alarming speed&#151;and taking its secrets with it.<br><br>As if on cue, there was another ear-shattering explosion from the face of the glacier, another shuddering cascade of ice. Marshall glanced toward the sound, feeling a mixture of irritation and impatience. A much larger section of the glacier's face had fallen away this time. With a sigh, he bent toward his specimens, then abruptly swiveled back in the direction of the glacier. Among the fractured ice boulders at its base, he could see that part of the mountain face beneath had been exposed by the calving. He squinted at it for a moment. Then he called over to Faraday.<br><br>"You've got the field glasses, don't you?"<br><br>"Right here."<br><br>Marshall walked toward him. The biologist had pulled the binoculars from a pocket and was holding them out with a heavily gloved hand. Marshall took them, breathed on the eyepieces to warm them, wiped them free of mist, then raised them toward the glacier.<br><br>"What is it?" Faraday said, excitement kindling in his voice. "What do you see?"<br><br>Marshall licked his lips and stared at what the fallen ice had revealed. "It's a cave," he replied.<br><br><br>2<br><br>An hour later, they stood before the icy rubble at the Fear glacier's front face. The freezing rain had stopped, and a weak sun struggled to pierce the gunmetal clouds. Marshall rubbed his arms briskly, trying to warm himself. He looked around at their little group. Sully had returned, bringing with him Ang Chen, the team's graduate student. Except for Penny Barbour, their computer scientist, the entire expedition was now assembled at the terminal moraine.<br><br>The cave lay directly ahead, its mouth black against the clear blue of the glacial ice. To Marshall, it looked like the barrel of a monstrous gun. Sully stared into it, chewing distractedly on his lower lip.<br><br>"Almost a perfect cylinder," he said.<br><br>"It's undoubtedly a branch pipe," Faraday said. "Mount Fear's riddled with them."<br><br>"The base is," Marshall replied. "But it's very unusual to see one at this altitude."<br><br>Abruptly, another section of ice front calved off the glacier about half a mile south, collapsing in house-sized blue chunks at its base and throwing up a cloud of ice shards. Chen started violently, and Faraday covered his ears against the roar. Marshall grimaced as he felt the mountain shudder beneath his feet.<br><br>It took several minutes for the echoes to die away. At last, Sully grunted. He glanced from the ice face, to the mouth of the cave, to Chen. "Got the video camera?"<br><br>Chen nodded and patted the equipment bag slung over one shoulder.<br><br>"Fire it up."<br><br>"You're not planning on going in, are you?" Faraday said.<br><br>Instead of answering, Sully straightened to his full five feet six inches, sucking in his paunch and adjusting the hood of his parka, readying himself for the camera lens.<br><br>"It's not a good idea," Faraday went on. "You know how brittle the lava formations are."<br><br>"That's not all," Marshall said. "Didn't you see what just happened? More ice could calve off and bury the entrance at any minute."<br><br>Sully looked back at the cave indecisively. "They'd want us to."<br><br>"They" referred to Terra Prime, the cable channel devoted to science and nature that was underwriting the expedition.<br><br>Sully rubbed one gloved hand against his chin. "Evan, Wright, you can stay out here. Ang will follow me in with the camera. If anything happens, get the army guys to chop us out."<br><br>"The hell with that," Marshall said immediately, grinning. "If you discover buried treasure, I want a cut."<br><br>"You said it yourself. It's not safe."<br><br>"All the more reason you need another hand," Marshall replied.<br><br>Sully's lower lip protruded truculently, and Marshall waited him out. Then the climatologist relented. "Okay. Wright, we'll be as quick as we can."<br><br>Faraday blinked his watery blue eyes but remained silent.<br><br>Sully brushed stray flakes of snow from his parka, cleared his throat. He glanced up a little gingerly at the ice front. Then he positioned himself before the camera. "We're standing at the face of the glacier," he said in a hushed, melodramatic voice. "The retreating ice has exposed a cave, nestled in the flank of the mountain. We're preparing to explore it now." He paused dramatically, then signaled for Chen to stop recording.<br><br>"Did you really say 'nestled' just now?" Marshall asked.<br><br>Sully ignored this. "Let's go." He pulled a large flashlight out of his parka pocket. "Ang, train the camera on me as we go inside."<br><br>He started forward, the gangly Chen obediently following in his wake. After a moment, Marshall pulled out his own flashlight and swung in behind them.<br><br>They picked their way slowly and carefully through the debris field. A few of the blocks of ice were the size of a fist; others, the size of a dormitory. In the weak sunlight, they glowed the pale blue of an October sky. Runnels of meltwater trickled past. As the three continued, the shadow of the glacier fell over them. Marshall looked up apprehensively at the vast wall of ice but said nothing.<br><br>Close up, the cave mouth looked even blacker. It exhaled a chill breath that pinched at Marshall's half-frozen nose. As Sully had said, it was quite round&#58; the typical secondary vent of a dead volcano. The glacier had smoothed the surrounding rock face to almost a mirror finish. Sully poked at the blackness with his flashlight. Then he turned toward Chen. "Turn that off a moment."<br><br>"Okay." The student lowered the camera.<br><br>Sully paused, then glanced at Marshall. "Faraday wasn't joking. This whole mountain is one big pile of fractured lava. Keep on the lookout for any weaknesses. If the tube seems at all unstable, we turn back immediately."<br><br>He looked back at Chen, nodded for him to start filming again. "We're going in," he intoned for the camera's benefit. Then he turned and stepped into the cave.<br><br>The roof wasn't especially low&#151;at least ten feet&#151;yet Marshall ducked instinctively as he followed Chen inside. The cave bored straight into the mountain, descending at a gentle grade. They proceeded cautiously, flashlight beams playing over the lava walls. It was even colder in here than out on the ice field, and Marshall snugged the hood of his parka tightly around his face.<br><br>"Hold up," he said. The beam of his flashlight had caught a hairline fracture in the braids of lava. He let his light travel along its length, then pressed at it gingerly with one hand.<br><br>"Looks solid," he said.<br><br>"Then let's proceed," Sully replied. "Carefully."<br><br>"It's amazing this tunnel hasn't collapsed under the weight of the glacier," said Chen.<br><br>They moved deeper into the cave, treading cautiously. When they spoke, it was in low tones, almost whispers.<br><br>"There's a coating of ice beneath the snow here," Sully said after a minute. "Spans the entire floor. Remarkably even."<br><br>"And it's getting deeper the farther we go," replied Marshall.
