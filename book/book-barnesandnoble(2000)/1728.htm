In 1966, when Stoppard�s <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em> premiered, the type of radical literary revisionism that play embodied was just a nascent twinkle in the average postmodernist�s eye.  But Stoppard�s recasting of two bit players from <em>Hamlet</em> as the leads in a new �adventure� burst the dam holding back a flood of reimagined biographies of characters from canonical literature.  (Curiously enough, 1966 also begat Jean Rhys�s <em>Wide Sargasso Sea, </em> a spin-off of <em>Jane Eyre.  </em>There was certainly something in the air!) <br><br>
Any such attempt to meddle in the imaginary universe of a classic work has to contend with twinned yet antithetical urges and imperatives.  The author, if respectful, wants to honor the canonicity and continuity and tone of the original, while still offering his own unique spin and inventions, hopefully in the true spirit of the template.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="readFullReviewContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">Read the Full Review</a></strong><h3>Synopsis</h3><p><p><i>A Lion Among Men</i> complements the New York Times bestseller <i>Son of a Witch</i> in fleshing out the world of Oz, seen this time through the eyes of the Cowardly Lion-remembered from <i>Wicked</i> as a tiny cub defended by Elphaba.
While civil war looms in Oz, an ancient and tetchy oracle named Yackle prepares for death. Before she can return to dust, however, the Cowardly Lion, an enigmatic figure named Brrr, arrives in search of information about Elphaba Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the West. As payment, Yackle, who hovered on the sidelines of Elphaba's life, demands some answers of her own.</p>

<p>Abandoned as a cub, Brrr's earliest memories are only gluey hazes. But his path from infancy in the Great Gillikin Forest is no Yellow Brick Road. Seeking to redress an early mistake, he tumbles though a swamp of ghosts, becomes implicated in a massacre of trolls, and falls in love with a Cat princess. Sidestepping the laws that oppress talking Animals, Brrr cannily avoids a jail sentence by agreeing to serve as a lackey to the warmongering Emperor of Oz.</p>

<p><i>A Lion Among Men</i> traces a battle of wits between adversaries distracted by the armies approaching on either side of them. What does the Lion know of the whereabouts of the Witch's boy, Liir? What can Yackle reveal about the auguries of the Clock of the Time Dragon? Is destiny ever arbitrary? Can those tarnished by infamy escape their sobriquets-cowardly, wicked, brainless, criminally earnest-to claim their own histories, to live honorably within their own skins before they're skinned alive?</p>
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>The entertaining third installment of bestseller Maguire's Wicked Years series, a revisionist chronicle of L. Frank Baum's classic <I>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</I>, examines the tragically misunderstood life of the Cowardly Lion before and after his adventures with Dorothy and company. As all-out war looms between the Munchkinland guerrillas and the emperor of Oz's Emerald City soldiers, Brrr the lion, now working as an imperial spy, must somehow glean invaluable information from a crone named Yackle before she dies. But during his interrogation of the irritable oracle, Brrr, the proverbial loner and outsider, uncovers insights into his own mysterious past-and finally begins to understand what it feels like to belong. As usual, the author mixes some relatively weighty existential themes-the search for self, faith, redemption-into his whimsical story line. Newcomers to Maguire's Oz should probably begin with <I>Wicked</I>, the first entry in this darkly enchanting saga. <I>11-city author tour.

He composed his own stories from an early age and released his first book for children, <I>The Lightning Time</I>,  in 1978, just two years after graduating from the State University of New York at Albany. <p>    Several other children's book followed, but major recognition eluded Maguire. Then, in 1995, he published his first adult novel. A bold, revisionist view of Frank L. Baum's classic Oz stories, <I>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</I>  places one of literature's most reviled characters at the center of a dark dystopian fantasy and raises provocative questions about the very nature of good and evil. Purists criticized Maguire for tampering with a beloved juvenile classic, but the book received generally good reviews (John Updike, writing in <i>The New Yorker</I>, proclaimed it "an amazing novel.") and the enthusiasm of readers catapulted it to the top of the bestseller charts. (Maguire's currency increased even further when the book was turned into the  Tony Award-winning  Broadway musical <i>Wicked</I> in 2003.) <p>    In the wake of his breakthrough novel, Maguire has made something of a specialty out of turning classic children's tales on their heads. He retold the legends of Cinderella and Snow White in <i>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</i> (1999) and <i>Mirror, Mirror</i> (2003); he raised the ghost of Ebenezer Scrooge in <i>Lost</I> (2001); and, in 2005, he returned to Oz for <i>Son of a Witch</I>, the long-awaited sequel to <i>Wicked</i>. He has reviewed fantasy fiction for the Sunday <I>New York Times Book Review</I> and has contributed his own articles, essays, and stories to publications like <I>Ploughshares</I>, <I>The Boston Review</I>, the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>,  and <I>The Horn Book Magazine</I>.<p>     In addition, Maguire has never lost his interest in -- or enthusiasm for -- children's literature. He is the author of The Hamlet Chronicles, a bestselling seven-book series of  high-camp mystery-adventures with silly count-down titles like <i>Seven Spiders Spinning</I> and  <i>Three Rotten Eggs</I>. He has taught at the Center for the Study of Children's Literature at Simmons College and is a founding member of Children's Literature New England (CLNE), a nonprofit organization that focuses attention on the significance of literature in the lives of children.<p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>In our interview, Maguire shared some fun facts with us about his life</I>: <p>    <b>"While I pride myself on trying to be creative</b> in all areas of my life, I have occasionally gone overboard, like the time I decided to bring to a party a salad that I constructed, on a huge rattan platter, to look like a miniature scale model of the Gardens of Babylon. I built terraces with chunks of Monterey jack, had a forest of broccoli florets and a lagoon of Seven Seas salad dressing spooned into a half a honeydew melon. I made reed patches out of scallion tips and walkways out of sesame seeds lined with raisin borders. Driving to the party, I had to brake to avoid a taxi, and by the time the police flagged me down for poor driving skills I was nearly weeping. �But Officer, I have a quickly decomposing Hanging Gardens of Babylon to deliver....' Everything had slopped and fallen over and it looked like a tray of vegetable garbage." <p>    <b>"My first job was scooping ice cream at Friendly's in Albany, New York.</b> I hated the work, most of my colleagues, and the uniform, and I more or less lost my taste for ice cream permanently." <p>    <b>"If I hadn't been a writer, I would have tried to be one of the following:</b> An artist (watercolors), a singer/songwriter like Paul Simon (taller but not very much more), an architect (domestic), a teacher. Actually, in one way or another I have done all of the above, but learned pretty quickly that my skills needed more honing for me to charge for my services, and I'd always rather write fiction than hone skills." <p>     <b>"I steal a bit from one of my favorite writers to say, simply,</b> that I enjoy, most of all, old friends and new places. I love to travel. Having small children at home now impedes my efforts a great deal, but I have managed in my time to get to Asia, Africa, most of Europe, and Central America. My wish list of places not yet visited includes India, Denmark, Brazil, and New Zealand, and my wish for friends not yet made includes, in a sense, readers who are about to discover my work, either now or even when I'm no longer among the living. In a sense, in anticipation, I value those friends in a special way."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2003, Gregory Maguire took some time out to talk with us about some of his favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  While I didn't know it at the time, eventually I have come to believe that T. H. White's <I>The Once and Future King</I> was the most influential book. I observed in it several admirable attributes that I try to make hallmarks of my own work. First, the book is derived from a popular set of myths and commonly held stories that form part of our Western foundation myth (the King Arthur stories). Second, the book is by turns profound, endearing, and comical. Third, the story is unwieldy in a way that seems organic and special. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>    <li><I>Unleaving</I> by Jill Paton Walsh -- This award-winning novel for young adults comes closer to being a true "novel of ideas" than any other book for the young I've ever read, including <I>A Separate Peace</I> and <I>The Catcher in the Rye</I> (neither of which were published for the young originally, it must be admitted). The novel is sensuous, moral, dramatic, and makes a great case for the excitement of intellectual inquiry. It also is brisk, gloriously written, and evocative of Virginia Woolf (the author spent her formative years, during the Blitz, living a quarter mile down the hill from where Woolf, as a young child, had spent summers, gazing out at the lighthouse at Godrevy in Cornwall). <p>    <li><I>The Towers of the Trebizond</I> by Rose Macaulay -- My stepmother recommended this book and I tried it three times, revising  my estimate of my stepmother's taste in literature with each abandoned attempt I made. The fourth time I was old enough to apprehend the humor in the tone, and then the story rolled with furious comedy to its startling conclusion. I have never reread this book, but I have meant to for 20 years, and I hold it fondly in memory. <p>    <li><I>The Diamond in the Window</I> by Jane Langton -- This is a children's fantasy first published in the middle 1960s. The wry line drawings by Erik Blegvad add to the story's depth and humanity as two orphaned children pursue their missing relatives through a series of dreams that enlarge their transcendental sensibilities and coalesce their family. <p>    <li><I>Human Voices</I> by Penelope Fitzgerald -- I'd read one novel by Fitzgerald and found it rather damp and dispiriting, but when I came to this I was rewarded. Though it takes a while to digest the use of acronyms for two of the main characters (they go by the initials associated with their business titles) that small effort is worth it. The novel takes place during the Blitz in London, as members of the BBC struggle to broadcast under trying circumstances.<p>    <li><I>Morality Play</I> by Barry Unsworth -- This novel takes place in the 13th century, as I remember, and brilliantly imagines nothing less than the birth of the novel, happening more or less simultaneously with the end of feudalism and the growth of the understanding of particular character, one person at a time. <p>    <li><I>Howards End</I> by E. M. Forster -- I selected this book only because I had to select something. Indeed, I'm a fan of all of Forster's work, no matter what can (and often is) said about his lack of sympathy or ability to portray real female characters. In general his sensitivity to the small but urgent moral questions of his day, especially relating to individual moral choice in the context of wider social pressures, continues to delight and inform me. His prose style is understated and affectionately comic most of the time, too, which I admire. <p>    <li><I>To the Lighthouse</I> by Virginia Woolf -- Likewise, I might have chosen <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I>, or <I>The Waves</I>, or even <I>Between the Acts</I> as my favorite, but <I>To the Lighthouse</I> is my selection mostly because it was in reading this novel (not my first Woolf experience) that I first realized the range and nature of her genius. <p>    <li><I>Harriet the Spy</I> by Louise Fitzhugh -- A children's novel by someone who might well have written for <I>The New Yorker</I> in the '60s, given her mildly acid tone and her keen eye for the telling moment. This novel of a precocious sixth-grade girl and the diary she keeps (and loses to her friends) made me roar with laughter as a child but also inspired in me what is, by now, a  33-year habit of keeping my own journal. And keeping a childhood journal was a vast part of my own development as a writer. <p>    <li><I>The Children of Knowe</I> by L. M. Boston -- This is the first "chapter" book I ever read. I was in second grade (I was a precocious reader myself). The book has rather little by way of plot, but was my introduction to literary atmosphere and also, I suppose, the seeding of a lifelong love of literature written by English writers. (Seven of these ten recommendations are by English writers.) I also eventually went to live in London, and -- memorably -- had tea with the author at her home in Cambridgeshire. The manor house in which she lived, and about which she wrote in this book and its sequels, is the oldest continually occupied domestic dwelling in England. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>    I'm not as much of a film buff as I am a reader, but, with apologies for my perhaps less than startling choices: <p>    <li><I>The Wizard of Oz</I> -- Naturally!  <li><I>The Sixth Sense</I> For its deft plotting.  <li><I>The Crying Game</I> -- For the same reason.  <li><I>Babette's Feast</I> -- The only movie I can watch repeatedly and tear up at the end, without fail.  <li><I>The Sound of Music</I> -- Because it made being Catholic and being musical synonymous, which my experience as an altar boy in a Catholic church had not revealed to me.  <li>Franco Zeffirelli's <I>Romeo and Juliet</I> -- I'm not sure what I'd think of it now, but I loved it as a teenage boy and have never forgotten many scenes of it.   <li><I>Topsy Turvy</I> -- Mike Leigh's Gilbert and Sullivan homage. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I like classical music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and I adore Bach above all. The late Beethoven string quartets satisfy through their modernity, and they make the symphonies look like the work of a very talented adolescent. I listen to jazz (on the radio) and to Portuguese fado and, when on long trips in the car alone, to original-cast recordings of Broadway musicals. I listen to nothing when I write. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  I would force the book club to read all of Dorothy Sayers, as I have read almost nothing of her and I am eager to be well educated enough to read Jill Paton Walsh's continuation of the Peter Wimsey stories. <p>    What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?  Increasingly I like books of reference, to get, especially older dictionaries and lists of place names and common surnames etc. Such tomes are helpful in constructing a story with verisimilitude. I like to give autographed novels as presents. <p>       <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have too much on my desk while writing. Usually file folders having to do with household repairs (the air conditioning is broken at the moment). I sit under a 1950s-era reproduction calendar portraying a Punchinello character eating a huge plate of pasta, and the instruction below in orangey letters is "MANGIA!" So this reminds me that I write, in part, to eat. With three small children at home, I have no ritual except to write when I can, when they're looking the other way.<p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b>  I rather shockingly sold my first manuscript to Farrar Straus, and it was published -- a chapter book for the 12-to-15 set -- a quarter of a century ago. However it took me 17 years to write a book that would make me any money or earn me any attention as a writer. That was <I>Wicked</I>, which was written while I lived in London in the early 1990s. I had had the idea some years earlier -- to invent a whole life for a very famous and hugely unexplored character -- and when what the English call "financial embarrassment" set in, I decided it was now or never. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I believe hugely in the value of a journal to keep oneself honest as well as in practice. I also think, though, when the well runs dry for a while you oughtn't berate yourself. <p>  --------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>  <I>In the summer of 2004, we asked authors featured in Meet the Writers to give us a list of their all-time favorite summer reads, and tell us what makes them just right for the season. Here's what Gregory Maguire had to say: </I> <p>    <li><I>Unleaving</I> by Jill Paton Walsh -- This is a novel published originally for teenagers but reissued (in England anyway) as part of a two-novella volume for adult readers. Teens and adults alike will take much from it. It is set between the wars in England, at a summer home in St. Ives, Cornwall. A party of young students in the last summer before going up to Oxford gathers in a holiday venue to read, discuss, and to witness a tragedy of extraordinary moment. The final few pages of the novel (no fair skipping head, they won't work the same magic if excised!) are among my favorite words in all of English literature. It is a sober book, but sun-drenched and memorable, like the best of vacations. <p>    <li><I>The Once and Future King</I> by T. H. White -- Perhaps you read this when younger. It holds up. Look in again. What you may forget is how very smart it is about human nature. The deft shift of tones from comic to tragic, intellectual to romantic, fantastic to historic, has rarely been done better. You come away with a sense that no effort has been spared. This book, more than any other, was the prototype I used when conceiving how to write my novel, <I>Wicked</I>.<p>    <li><I>Morality Play</I> by Barry Unsworth -- I first read this five or six years ago. I got about a third of the way through, thinking "oh, a pleasant Brother Cadfael-type entertainment," when the book suddenly began to raise big issues in a big way. I thought: "Holy moley. I was wrong. This isn't an entertainment. This is a serious novel. I don't want to miss a thing." So I went back to the beginning and started over. Yes, it is entertaining (though I hear the movie based on it, with a different title, is less than wonderful), but it is also riveting morally and intellectually. It is about nothing so much as the birth of the individual consciousness and the birth of the novel--the idea that everyone's got a story, not just the ennobled or the sainted.<p>    <li><I>Mariette in Ecstasy</I> by Ron Hansen -- I was in Cambodia adopting my second son, and to still him I wandered up and down the halls of the Sunway Hotel in Phnom Penh, and murmured the soft lines of Hansen's elliptical, poetic prose to calm the baby. The book is about an early twentieth-century young novice experiencing stigmata and having devotional hot flashes. It is about passion, but is neither lewd nor dismissive of piety. The only problem with this book is that it will ruin the next four or five novels for you. It is that good. <p>    <li><I>Magic by the Lake</I> by Edward Eager -- A children's fantasy -- not the most famous of the Edward Eager books (that would be <I>Half Magic</I>). This is <I>Half Magic</I>'s sequel. Good summer reading because it takes place at a summer cabin in some cheesy peduncle resort, probably the 1920's though readers young and old won't get stuck in antique vernacular. It is, I think, the funniest of this very funny writer's books, and what could be better to read under a layer of Coppertone than <I>Magic by the Lake</I>? Isn't that why we go on holidays anyway? Remember to use the high-strength sunblock, by the way.<p>    <li><I>The Swing in the Summerhouse</I> by Jane Langton -- Another children's fantasy, and another one that takes place over a summer. Pay especial attention to the crisp line drawings by that underrated master of the type, Erik Blegvad. The story is by Concord's quirky apologist, Jane Langton, perhaps better known to the world at large as the author of the Homer Kelly mysteries for adults. This story takes two loosely guarded siblings through a series of fantastic episodes that point up the virtues and the perils of growing up -- something that in summer we all try to forget we're still doing. <p>    <li><I>The Hounds of the Morrigan</I> by Pat O'Shea -- I suppose my hand is being shown here. I love fantasy, and fantasy for children seems somehow more convincing than most fantasy for adults. <I>The Hounds of the Morrigan</I> is a grand comic tapestry of a novel, set in Ireland. Two siblings set out across Ireland in some rosily-remembered summer past, and the cast of characters they meet will have you laughing out loud and drowning out Howard Stern on the radio on the blanket next door. <p>    <li><I>Bat 6</I> by Virginia Euwer Wolff -- Want something less frolicy, but still fast-moving and summer-tinged? Baseball will serve. This is a novel about girls' baseball teams in the mid-century, the cost of war, the cost of apology. Loan this to your teenage reader and then grab it back again as soon as he or she is done. The author has laser-sharp control of her characters and the questions raised will be revisited around the dying coals of the hibachi well into the evening.<p>    <li><I>Senseless</I> by Stona Fitch -- All right, this is not for everyone. I'll be up front about that. But if you, like me, want your vacation to be a time in which you remember what the world is like and come to terms with it better -- rather than flinching at the headlines all year long and looking away -- <I>Senseless</I> is for you. It is about the kidnapping and torture of a mid-level American businessman in Europe. It is graphic and it is violent, but it is not excessive. Not for the weak-stomached nor for the sentimental. But you won't forget it. It may be the best book you read this summer.<p>    <li><I>The Keeping-Room</I> by Betty Levin -- For a change of pace, try this: get it from the library if your local bookstore hasn't got it in paperback. <I>The Keeping-Room</I> is a mystery for teenagers; adults will be riveted too, because of the understated and sympathetic characterizations. It involves a kidnapped child and a century-old mystery unearthed during a high school boy's local history project. The atmosphere of trendy New England suburbia is cuttingly evoked, and the pace is fast and the payoff worth it.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</h3><p>It all began, to some degree, with Tom Stoppard.<br><br>
In 1966, when Stoppard�s <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em> premiered, the type of radical literary revisionism that play embodied was just a nascent twinkle in the average postmodernist�s eye.  But Stoppard�s recasting of two bit players from <em>Hamlet</em> as the leads in a new �adventure� burst the dam holding back a flood of reimagined biographies of characters from canonical literature.  (Curiously enough, 1966 also begat Jean Rhys�s <em>Wide Sargasso Sea, </em> a spin-off of <em>Jane Eyre.  </em>There was certainly something in the air!) <br><br>
Any such attempt to meddle in the imaginary universe of a classic work has to contend with twinned yet antithetical urges and imperatives.  The author, if respectful, wants to honor the canonicity and continuity and tone of the original, while still offering his own unique spin and inventions, hopefully in the true spirit of the template. <br><br>
Gregory Maguire achieved this masterfully in his justly celebrated novel <em>Wicked</em> (1995).  He took a relatively undeveloped character, L. Frank Baum's Wicked Witch of the West from the Oz books, and built a Bildungsroman around her.  Given a name, Elphaba Thropp, our Witch became a tragic character of almost Shakespearian dimensions, while the land and society of Baum's imagination was fleshed out with deep sophistication. <BR /><BR />

Maguire offered an Oz that was both a stage for political allegory and a weird landscape of spiritual questing. He returned to its terrain ten years later with <em>Son of a Witch </em>and now continues his exploration with <em>A Lion Among Men, </em>the third in the newly christened <em>Wicked Years</em> series. <br><br>
Our focus this go-round is Brrr, the one and only Cowardly Lion.  We�ve seen him glancingly in the prior installments, but now we get to plumb his depths.  The real-time frame of the story is a mere 24 hours (a day some nine years onward from the close of <em>Son</em>) spent at the �mauntery of Saint Glinda.�  Brrr, a reluctant secret agent for the Emerald City under Emperor Shell (Elphaba�s brother), has arrived to interview a mysterious �maunt,� or nun, named Yackle, who might possess information as to the whereabouts of Elphaba's son Liir and his daughter, potential rivals to Shell.  Yackle�s price for cooperating is for Brrr to recount his life story, in flashback form.  <br><br>
It�s a tale of high naive ambitions and glorious dreams betrayed by innate vices like sloth and indecision, and a fair amount of sheer bad luck and human malice.  (Talking animals are second-class citizens in Oz.)  As he did with <em>Wicked</em>'s Elphaba, Maguire builds appealingly and daringly on Baum's original conception: Brrr emerges from the novel as a figure whose self-knowledge has only achingly accentuated his status as failure and misfit. <br><br>


The impulse to continue or revise the literary creations of others had been around, of course, for a long time before Stoppard.  No sooner was Dickens cooling in his grave than folks were trying to complete <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood.  </em>And the realm of folktales has always lent itself to anonymous extensions and elaborations by many disparate minds. <br><br>
Genre fiction in particular seems to encourage, by some element of its very nature, a writer�s desire to create (and an audience�s desire to read) alternate or extended scenarios for beloved fictional personages, adventures that elaborate or revise deep continuity. The Sherlockians led the way early on, by treating Doyle�s stories about Holmes as pieces of a biography, new bits of which could be uncovered by �scholarship.�  Ludic masters like Philip Jose Farmer were soon constructing enormous edifices like the Wold Newton Family Tree, which omnivorously amalgamated such diverse heroes as Tarzan, Solomon Kane, Lew Archer, and Philip Marlowe.  And what are superhero comics and franchise fiction like the hundreds of <em>Star Trek </em>books if not the ultimate many-handed literary beast? <br><br>
Of course, somewhere along the line comes fan fiction, that much-derided wart on the body of �real literature.�  Yet internet expert Bill Tancer recently estimated that fan fiction constitutes a full third of all fiction-related material available on the Web, testifying to its allure and power.  <br><br>

So what distinguishes a book such as <em>A Lion Among Men </em>from any teen�s Buffy-meets-Naruto maunderings? The same things that distinguish any good book of any stripe from its amateurish counterparts:  depth and clarity of vision, excellence of prose, richness of theme, intricacy of characterization, shapeliness of plot.  And while <em>A Lion Among Men</em> boasts all these virtues in greater-than-average abundance, I have to opine that it (and its immediate predecessor, <em>Son of a Witch</em>) don�t pack quite the punch of <em>Wicked </em>and indeed offer some frustrations typical of less-creative fantasy series. <br><br>
While many of the events of Brrr�s past will be new and intriguing to the reader, his backstory acquires an overall <em>Rashomon </em>aura:  it�s just another angle on the events of the first two volumes.  True, by novel�s end, we�ve discovered the secret identity of Liir�s long-missing half sister Nor, Yackle�s own secrets, and more of the motivations of the mysterious prophecy engine known as The Clock of the Time Dragon.  But the book seems stuck in a holding pattern, so far as the whole series� progress is concerned. <br><br>
Moreover, when characters are calling dessert �afters� or swanning about in Oscar Wilde fashion, an Anglophile element creeps into Maguire�s Oz.  Now, Baum�s Oz was famously an all-American fairy tale, the first real one of its kind, full of demotic vigor and frontier zest.  Losing that aspect is Maguire�s sole betrayal of the original books. <br><br>

	Happily, his prose remains an elegant delight, full of striking aphorisms and aper&ccedil;us and philosophical insights into life.  The dialogue is always crisp and pointed and droll.  Maguire's depiction of Oz approaches at times the bizarre dimensions and heft of China Mi&eacute;ville�s New Crobuzon, especially in such elements as the prison of Southstairs.  And he obviously knows the vast Oz mythos and alludes to many pieces of the14-book original -- watch for old favorite the Glass Cat in <em>Lion </em> -- as well as to the film, although he revises events and characters to his taste. The overall effect of his storytelling is a blend of the best of William Kotzwinkle, Walter Moers, Ray Bradbury, and Christopher Moore. <br><br>
	Maguire�s achievement in the Wicked Years books ranks high, right up there with the similarly inspired milestones by Geoff Ryman in<em> Was </em> (1992) and Alan Moore in<em> Lost Girls </em>(2006).  The new superstructure each man has erected on Baum�s foundation shines like the Emerald City seen from the Yellow Brick Road. --<i>Paul DiFilippo</i><br><br>

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>The entertaining third installment of bestseller Maguire's Wicked Years series, a revisionist chronicle of L.

As all-out war looms between the Munchkinland guerrillas and the emperor of Oz's Emerald City soldiers, Brrr the lion, now working as an imperial spy, must somehow glean invaluable information from a crone named Yackle before she dies. But during his interrogation of the irritable oracle, Brrr, the proverbial loner and outsider, uncovers insights into his own mysterious past-and finally begins to understand what it feels like to belong. As usual, the author mixes some relatively weighty existential themes-the search for self, faith, redemption-into his whimsical story line. Newcomers to Maguire's Oz should probably begin with <I>Wicked</I>, the first entry in this darkly enchanting saga. <I>11-city author tour.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>In this third entry in his "Wicked Years" series-following <i>Wicked</i> and <i>Son of a Witch</i>-Maguire (<WEBADDRESS>www.gregorymaguire.com</WEBADDRESS>) returns to Oz, this time homing in on Brrr, aka the Cowardly Lion. Though at times needlessly complex, the story ultimately both intrigues and entertains. Audie&reg; Award winner John McDonough's (<i>Grace Will Lead Me Home</i>) performance is adequate, though Brrr's low growlings can be difficult to understand. Recommended for most fiction collections. [Audio clip available through <WEBADDRESS>www.harperaudio.com</WEBADDRESS>; the Morrow hc was recommended "for all fiction collections," <i>LJ</i>10/15/08.-Ed.]</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>The further adventures of L. Frank Baum's beloved characters are more fatefully connected with the political history of Oz in this third installment of Maguire's justly praised revisionist series. In Wicked and Son of a Witch, we were treated to engagingly comic melodramas that followed (respectively) Baum's heroine Dorothy and the fugitive son (Liir) of Wicked Witch Elphaba Thropp through an endangered fantasyland blighted by mad power struggles. This time around, the major conflict is engineered by an intellectually challenged puppet emperor addicted to waging multiple wars (hmmm . . . ). And our protagonist is the Cowardly Lion (named Brrr)-bereft of his family, Brrr is traveling through Oz undercover as an imperial spy, in exchange for immunity from draconian Animal Adverse Laws that target talking animals. Brrr's investigations take him to the Mauntery (i.e. cloister) of St. Glinda, where a moribund seeress (Yackle, who's presumably too ornery to die) unfurls information in a narrative neatly juxtaposed with Brrr's unhappy memories and compromised present plans. The cast of characters also includes a clan of forest bears, a beauteous maiden or two, the rebellious citizens of Munchkinland and a surly dwarf who (in quite Wagnerian fashion) guards an ancient book of magic (the Grimmerie) and the Clock of the Time Dragon. Most of this is superbly entertaining, but Maguire has bitten off more complex interactions than he can chew, and his story's seams frequently show. No matter. Brrr and his acquaintances are irresistible company, and issues of legitimate and responsible rule are herein really rather subtly grafted onto the venerable free will vs. predestination conundrum ("With so muchwritten in magic, how can we hope to become agents culpable for our own lives ?"). Maguire's inspired world-building strides from strength to strength.

She blasphemed with gusto and she knocked the scented oils across the shroud they'd readied on a trestle nearby.</p><P>"God love her," they said, in bitter, unconvincing voices...or perhaps they meant <i>May the Unnamed God love her, our unrepentant sister Yackle, for we certainly can't.</i></p><P>"Sink me in the crypt," she said, speaking directly to them for the first time in years. "You're too young to know; that's how they used to do it. When the time came for an elder to go and she wouldn't, they settled her down in the ossuary so she could chummy up to the bones. Supplied her with a couple of candles and a bottle of wine. Let her get used to the notion. They came back a year later to sweep up the leavings."</p><P>"Mercy," said whoever was nearby to hear.</p><P>"I insist," she replied. "Check with Sister Scholastica and she'll bear me out.""She's raving mad," said someone else, chocolately. Yackle approved of chocolate, and indeed, everything edible. Since Yackle's eyesight had gone out for good a decade earlier, she identified individuals by the degree and idiosyncracy of their halitosis.</p><P>"She's always been raving mad," said a third observer, Vinegarish Almonds. "Isn't that rather sweet?"</p><P>Yackle reached for something to throw, and all she could find was her other hand, which wouldn't detach.</p><P>"She's doing sign language." "The poor, deluded dovelette.""Clinging to life so...whatever for?" "Perhaps it isn't her time."</p><P>"It is," said Yackle, "it is, I keep telling you. Won't you fiends let me die? I want to go to hell in a handbasket. Put me out of my misery and into the Afterlife where I can do some real damage, damn it."</p><P>"She's not herself," said someone.</p><P>"She was never reliably herself, to hear tell," said another.</p><P>The bedsheets caught fire spontaneously. Yackle found she was rather enjoying this, but it helped neither her reputation nor her rescue that the only liquid nearby with which to douse the flames was cognac.</p><P>Still, Yackle was not to be dissuaded. "Isn't there a Superior in the House?" she asked. "Someone who can lay down the law?"</p><P>"The Superior Maunt died a decade ago," they replied. "We work by consensus now. We've noted your request to be interred alive. We'll put it on the agenda and take it up next week at Council."</p><P>"She'll burn the House down, and us with it," muttered a novice, sometime later. Yackle could tell that the innocent speaker was talking to herself, to stoke her courage.</p><P>"Come here, my duckie," said Yackle, grasping. "I smell a little peppermint girl nearby, and no garlicky matron hovering. Are you the sentry? On our own, are we? Come, sit nearer. Surely there is still a Sister Apothecaire in residence? With her cabinets of nostrums and beckums, tonics and tablets? She must possess a sealed jar, it would be dark blue glass, about yea-high, pasted over with a label picturing three sets of crossed tibias. Couldn't you find this and pour me out a fatal little decoction?"</p><P>"Not a spoonful of it, I en't the grace to do it," said Peppermint Girl. "Let go a me, you harpy. Let go or...or I'll bite you!"</p><P>Out of charity to the young, Yackle let go. It would do the poor girl no good to take a bite of old Yackle. <i>The antidote en't been invented yet</i>, and so on.</p><P>Hours and days pass at elastic rhythms for the blind. Whether the pattern of her naps and wakings followed the ordinary interruptions of daylight by nighttime, Yackle couldn't tell. But someone she recognized as Broccoli Breath eventually informed her that the sorority had decided to bow to Yackle's final wish. They would install her in the crypt among the remains of women long dead. She could approach bodily corruption at whatever speed appealed to her. Three candles, and as to nourishment, red or white?</p><P>"A beaker of gasoline and a match as a chaser," said Yackle, but she was indulging in a joke; she was that pleased. She nominated a saucy persimmon <i>flaucande</i> and a beeswax candle scented with limeberries...for the aroma, not for the light. She was beyond light now.</p><P>"Good voyage, Eldest Soul," they sang to her as they carried her down the stairs. Though she weighed no more than sugarbrittle she was awkward to move; she couldn't govern her own arms or legs. As if motivated by a spite independent of her own, her limbs would keep ratcheting out to jab into doorjambs. The procession lacked a fitting dignity.</p><P>"Don't come down for at least a year," she sang out, giddy as a lambkin. "Make that two. I might be old as sin itself, but once I start rotting it won't be pretty. If I hammer at the cellar door don't open it; I'm probably just collecting for some public charity in hell."</p><P>"Can we serenade you with an epithalamium, as you go to marry Death?" asked one of the bearers, tucking in the shroud to make it cozy.</p><P>"Save your doggy breath. Go, go, on to the rest of your lives, you lot. It's been a swell, mysterious mess of a life. Don't mind me. I'll blow the candles out before I lower my own lights."</p><P>A year later when a sister ventured into the crypt to prepare for another burial, she came across the hem of Yackle's shroud. She wept at the notion of death until Yackle sat up and said, "What, morning already? And I having those naughty dreams!" The maunt's tears turned to screams, and she fled upstairs to start immediately upon a long and lively career as an alcoholic.</p><i><b>A Lion Among Men</b></i>. Copyright &copy; by Gregory Maguire.
