Bombs are dropping on London. And President Roosevelt is promising he won't send our boys to fight in "foreign wars."<p>But American radio gal Frankie Bard, the first woman to report from the Blitz in London, wants nothing more than to bring the war home. Frankie's radio dispatches crackle across the Atlantic ocean, imploring listeners to pay attention�as the Nazis bomb London nightly, and Jewish refugees stream across Europe. Frankie is convinced that if she can just get the right story, it will wake Americans to action and they will join the fight.<p>Meanwhile, in Franklin, Massachusetts, a small town on Cape Cod, Iris James hears Frankie's broadcasts and knows that it is only a matter of time before the war arrives on Franklin's shores.

												Chris Bohjalian</h3><p>It is, perhaps, the middle third of <i>The Postmistress</i> that is most poignant and authentic and, I believe, gets at the heart of Blake's intention for this novel: the idea that Americans were not paying attention between 1933 and 1941. In this section, Frankie travels on trains across France in 1941 with Jewish refugees trying to reach Spain or Portugal or a boat west to the Americas. Frankie is using a recording technology, Blake admits in an author's note, that wouldn't have been available to her for another two years, but her interviews with the families are profoundly affecting, and the tension is riveting as each visa is checked. The stakes are high for these refugees, and here the novel soars.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>Sarah Blake is a poet, novelist, and essayist who has participated in many writing workshops.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><div id="flashcontent"></div><SCRIPT language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://natalie.feedroom.com/fr_embed.js"></SCRIPT><SCRIPT type="text/javascript">

											Too young to know or appreciate the agonies of what lead up to the USA coming into WWII, I was fascinated and horrified by the real descriptions of the Blitz in London, the exodus of the Jews and other foreigners from their homes and possessions, the difficulties experienced and the inhumanities suffered before the war began in earnest. <p/>The life of a reporter, especially a woman, in 1940 is shown to perfection in a male oriented world. Having experienced the similar boarding school and women's college in the East at a much later date, it was easy to understand the uniqueness and drive of Frankie. The dedication of the postmistress, the innocence of the young bride, the conflict of the young town doctor, the town mechanic -  all seem to be archetypes of the era. The author adds to the authenticity by including names of real newscasters of the time who lasted way beyond the '40's. A very worthwhile read.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Code-Name-Mary/Muriel-Gardiner/e/9780300029406/?pv=y">Code Name "Mary"</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Guernsey-Literary-and-Potato-Peel-Pie-Society/Mary-Ann-Shaffer/e/9780385341004/?pv=y">The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Help/Kathryn-Stockett/e/9780399155345/?pv=y">The Help</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Regeneration/Pat-Barker/e/9780452270077/?pv=y">Regeneration</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Eye-in-the-Door/Pat-Barker/e/9780452272729/?pv=y">The Eye in the Door</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>If you like THE GUERNSEY LITERARY &amp; POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=bookchickdi">bookchickdi</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1392798_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780399156199_BK_24_1392798" href="#previewReview_1392798" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 21, 2010: 
											Back in March, I posted that I had the great pleasure to attend a reading and book signing for Sarah Blake's The Postmistress, from Amy Einhorn Books of G.P. Putnam's Sons. It was fascinating to hear the creative process behind the book, a fictional novel about three women's lives that collide during World War II.<p/><p/>Blake described the research that she did for this remarkable novel. She began with Iris James, the postmistress of a small community on Cape Cod. Iris took her job very seriously, believing deeply in the order of government, truth and that mail must be delivered. <p/><p/>Emma was a young bride, in love with her young doctor husband Will, who leaves her behind, pregnant, while he goes off to help the war effort in England after an unfortunate outcome for a patient shakes his belief in himself.<p/><p/>The most intriguing character is Frankie Bard, a young female reporter who travels to England and ends up as war correspondent working with Edward R. Murrow. When I was a young girl, I wanted be like Brenda Starr, the strong reporter from the comic strip. After reading this novel, I want to be Frankie Bard. (Blake wrote in my book &quot;So glad you're a Frankiephile&quot;!)<p/><p/>Frankie fights to bring the truth of the war to her listeners. The most intense, gripping part of the story takes place when Frankie is on a train traveling through France to Spain. The train is filled with people, many of them Jewish, fleeing the Nazis. The tension on the train is palpable, and Blake writes those scenes with such realism, you can feel your heart beating through your chest as these people are praying to make it to safety.<p/><p/>Frankie hopes to get some people to speak into her new recording device, determined to bring the tapes back to England and allow the people of America to hear the truth in the words of people who fear for their lives. (At this point, the American people are not aware of the atrocities the Nazis are inflicting on Jews and other people.)<p/><p/>Blake parallels Frankie trying to bring the truth of the war to Americans who were confused and uninformed with reporters who were trying to bring the truth of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years. She likens the fear in America following Pearl Harbor to the fear and uncertainty we felt after 9/11. <p/><p/>The Postmistress feels authentic, thanks to Blake's research at The Radio &amp; Television Museum in Bowie, Maryland. She listened to recordings made by Mary Marvin Breckinridge, Betty Wason, and Martha Gellhorn, female war correspondents, and they inspired the fascinating character of Frankie.<p/><p/>In the end, Frankie and Iris must make a decision that requires them to question whether they can uphold their beliefs about truth and duty. This gripping novel, filled with strong characterizations, asks us to question our own beliefs in the face of adversity as well. <p/><p/>Amy Einhorn, whom I was lucky enough to meet at the signing, has a gift for finding talented writers with a fresh, strong voice.

She is the author of a chapbook of poems, <i>Full Turn</i> (Pennywhistle Press, 1989); an artist book, <i>Runaway Girls \</i> (Hand Made Press, 1997) in collaboration with the artist, Robin Kahn; and two novels. Her first novel, <i>Grange House</I>, (Picador, 2000) was named a "New and Noteworthy" paperback in August, 2001 by <i>The New York Times</i>. Her second novel, <i>The Postmistress</I>, was  by Amy Einhorn Books/Putnam in February 2010. Her essays and reviews have appeared in <i>Good Housekeeping</I>, <i>US News and World Reports</I>, <i>The Chicago Tribun</I> and elsewhere.<p>    Sarah taught high school and college English for many years in Colorado and New York. She has taught fiction workshops at the Fine Arts Works Center in Provincetown, MA, The Writer's Center in Bethesda, MD, the University of Maryland, and George Washington University. She lives in Washington, DC.</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some fascinating outtakes from our interview with Sarah Blake:</i><p>  "In the three summers while I was in college, I tried out three different lives in my summer jobs -- full immersion: intern at an Art Auction house in NYC; kitchen girl at a dude ranch in Montana; jewelry store clerk in a tiny shop on an island off the coast of Sicily. I took the immersion a little too close to heart for my mother -- after the second summer, in my incarnation as a cowgirl, I announced I was thinking about quitting college, marrying the cowboy I was dating there, and  becoming a rancher. How could I not? The cowboy left me love letters hidden in the horn of my saddle."<p>      "I am a big gardener and re-arranger of furniture. The two are inextricably related, in my mind, to my writing. When I can't figure out a scene, or when I'm stumped as to why a character makes a certain choice -- I go out and dig, and plot and plan and rearrange. In the winter, handily, there are similar chances to plot and plan and rearrange inside the house. When I get an idea in my head about how a room might look, I am completely obsessed with trying it out, right then and there. One night I was certain that the problem with our living room was the rug and that the answer to the problem lay upstairs on the third floor in my son's bedroom. Never mind that it was eleven o'clock and he was fast asleep, and the bed he slept in lay squarely on top of the rug. I jimmied and lifted and snatched the rug out from under the sleeping child, hauled it down the three flights, and then lifted and lowered and hauled the furniture around down in the living room. By the time my husband came home at midnight, I had just finished rolling the rug out in the living room. We both stared at it. It was completely and totally wrong."<p>    "I come from a big family of singers-around the campfire, in a cappella groups in school, in the back of the car -- and I love to sing, love to hear singing. Similarly, I grew up listening to grown ups talking at dinner, extending dinner late into the night, all of us ranged around a big table in the house my grandparents bought in the "30s in Maine. My idea of happiness is just that: many faces, many generations,  much discussion, candles and talk while the dishes shift in the sink."<p>     "I love fog. I love rain. I love the moment right after a play ends -- the second of pure silence when everyone in the theatre, actors and audience, are joined -- before the clapping starts and the actors bow and we pick up our lives again."<p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>In the fall of 2009, Sarah Blake took some time to talk with us  about her favorite books, authors, and interests.</i><p>  <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>    There are all the books I read curled up on a couch in summer childhood -- all the Little House books, <i>The Secret Garden</i>, <i>The Little Princess</i>, <i>The Wolves of Willoughby Chase</i>,  <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> -- that gave me worlds right there where I sat, while the hot wind of New Haven drifted over the window sill. That feeling of reading worlds, of diving down below the surface of my own life made me a reader, an irredeemable bookworm.<p>    But it was <i>To the Lighthouse</i>  by Virginia Woolf that made me want to become a writer. I read her sentences -- all the beauty and the longing in them -- and I simply wanted to write them myself. The way her characters thought and moved, the light and sound she captured of a summer day -- all this I wanted to make mine. She showed me how to capture what she calls "moments of being" -- clear, resonant times in our lives of pure beauty, caught just as they vanish.<p>        <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>    This list keeps changing, though there are the stalwarts -- the books I read and reread:   <li><i>Jane Eyre</I> by Charlotte Bronte; <i>Middlemarch</i> by George Eliot, and <i>To The Lighthouse</i> by Virginia Woolf. Those three were my early guides into the questions that I seem always to be raising: What does it mean to be a woman who wants something more than her world can give her? What does that wanting look like? <p>    <li><i>The Man Who Loved Children</i>, a little-read masterpiece of family life and marriage by Christina Stead, is a wild ride that nearly bursts out of its own skin -- something I turn to again and again to remember how to push sentences as hard as they can go.<p>    <li><i>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</i> by Muriel Spark is exhilarating and essential in the opposite direction. It tells its story so neatly and narrowly, it makes you shiver. It has a take no prisoners stance, which is something I admire.<p>    <li><i>Holes</i> by Louis Sachar was the first book I read as an adult that reminded me of the sheer pleasure one can take in a beautifully constructed plot, and I return to it again and again --often teaching it to adult writers -- as a way to show how the deep delight of a satisfying read is tightly constructed.<p>    Against that I would set one of my favorites, <i>See Under Lov</i> by the Israeli writer, David Grossman. I couldn't begin to explain what it's about --  simply that to read it is to vanish into a vast imagination (at one point the book is narrated by the sea), purely and unabashedly as you read your way into the minds and lives of post Holocaust survivors in Israel.<p>    <li> The Icelandic epic <i>Independent People</i> by Halldor Laxness, I turn to (like <i>Middlemarch</i>)  for the pleasure of that large overseeing voice narrating a multi-peopled, multi-generational town and time. <p>     And finally, there are two books I have on my shelf that inspire me over and over: Ann Patchett's <i>Bel Canto</i> and Cormac McCarthey's <i>The Road</I>. Each of these makes no bones about the fact that the end for the characters inside them will not be good, and then each proceeds to give us a story so full of life and love and devotion, moving us all forward inexorably toward the end the novels promise. But oh how alive that life before the end is. And how human.    <p>      <B>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>    I love the Coen brothers' movies. I loved <i>Fargo</i> because of how many shots there were of Marge sitting inside her car, silent, and thinking. I love the way their movies are plotted.<p>    I love <i>Thelma and Louise</i>, because of the impossible set-up -- that they will drive to Mexico without going through Texas -- and the way it brings the two women to see where they are really going.<p>    I could watch <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</I> again and again, because it does seem to capture life, those moments of being, that are true and are gone even as we catch them.<p>          <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>    Anything that tells a story or has a great voice attached (raw or fine) -- which means I love country music as much as I love Kurt Cobain. I can't listen to anything while I'm writing.<p>          <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>     Cookbooks -- I love looking at the photographs of food, and of people eating food and making food--and novels, and of the latter -- I especially like being given the novels that my friends put into my hands saying, this changed my life. (For whatever reason.)<p>            <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>    I have two school-age children, and early on I realized that if my writing day started after I had gotten them up, made their lunches, taken them to school, and talked to the various other parents at the gates, my head was so full of all those voices -- all that lovely and not so lovely commotion -- that when I sat down at my desk often there was simply nothing there. So I began waking up an hour or two before my whole household, making a cup of coffee, and getting to work in the dark, in the solid uninterrupted early morning quiet. Often, I can begin a scene or start to sketch something out and then I have something to return to after the school run; I don't have to climb all the way back up the mountain to get to my work, it's right there waiting for me. This has become so firm a ritual that I find myself now waking up at five whether I'm writing or not.<p>              <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>    To answer how long it took for me to get to this point depends on where you start counting. I think I always knew I wanted to be a writer, but was too chicken to call myself one really until after my first novel was published.  My father was an editor at a university press; and books, and the discussion around making them, was very much the currency of our house. I remember sitting beside him -- I must have been quite young, eight or nine -- watching as he took a red pencil to a manuscript, and realizing then that writing a good sentence, let alone a good book, was the work of years.<p>    I wrote stories and poems all through high school, but then in college I had several great teachers of poetry and I started writing poems exclusively. This was before there were workshops in undergraduate English Departments, so the writing of poetry was taught as part of a Literature class. After college I taught American Lit to 10th graders and wrote poems undercover. But teaching was a great way for me to learn more deeply and for myself how a great poem worked, because it was up to me to explain it. After a few years I realized that I wanted to take some writing classes;  and at this point I had moved to San Francisco, where there is a really vibrant community of writers. I went to every reading I could, and I slowly screwed up my courage to read myself in some of the open mikes. By a stroke of great good luck, a small collection of my poems was accepted for publication, and I started to think of myself as a teacher and a writer.<p>    I started a doctoral program in Victorian Literature, while also concentrating on writing a book-length collection of poems. But I began to find myself impatient with poems, feeling like I wanted to write past the endings of poem, wanting more space and more room and more voices to come in. And one day I just started writing in someone's voice -- a 19th-century woman who lived in Maine -- and then she had a sister, and that's how my first novel began. I was writing my dissertation on Charlotte Bront�, and I realized that I just wanted to write another Bront� novel, and that was that. I finished my PhD but left academia, a writer -- out from under cover.<p>    <i>The Postmistress</I>  took eight years to write (the same age as my youngest child, as it happens. And I don't mention that lightly). Aside from the struggle to create uninterruptible writing time with two children, this novel was a struggle because I had a very elaborate idea in my head, and couldn't write my way toward it. I have nearly 1000 pages thrown out. It took nearly seven years to get a draft that my agent felt could be sent out. I needed an editor, but it took quite a while for this book to find its way to Amy Einhorn. The first time my agent sent the book out it was rejected by 12 editors, though many of them wrote very helpful rejections. I took it back and reworked it. Then the second time it was sent out, Amy read it and passed on it. All the other editors it was sent to in that round passed on it as well. After eight years and many, many drafts, and many rejections, I decided that perhaps it was best to simply bury it, put it in a drawer and move on to a new project.<p>    Six weeks later, Amy called and said she had changed her mind, that she wanted to take a chance on it, that she wanted to see if we could do the work  it needed. "I don't care how long it takes, three months, or even a year," she said, "take your time." A year? I remember thinking. No way. I've been working on it already for seven -- how can it possibly take another year! <p>    Many drafts, and indeed, one year later-- here is <i>The Postmistress</i>. It is absolutely the product of that inexplicable magic a great editor performs. It is also a testament to the simple fact of slogging forward -- long after it makes any sense -- just to see if you can get where you imagined going.<p>              <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>    Read. Read. Read. And imitate. And keep at it until you start to hear your own voice through the voices of your teachers, of your literary guides. And then send out your work as much as you can bear to. Send it out by submitting it, but also send it out by finding the writing community in your area and joining the conversation with other writers.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P><b>Unabridged CDs, 9 CDs, 11 hours</b> <br><br> Read by TBA <br><br> What would happen if someone did the unthinkable-and didn't deliver a letter?

								Chris Bohjalian</h3><p>It is, perhaps, the middle third of <i>The Postmistress</i> that is most poignant and authentic and, I believe, gets at the heart of Blake's intention for this novel: the idea that Americans were not paying attention between 1933 and 1941. In this section, Frankie travels on trains across France in 1941 with Jewish refugees trying to reach Spain or Portugal or a boat west to the Americas. Frankie is using a recording technology, Blake admits in an author's note, that wouldn't have been available to her for another two years, but her interviews with the families are profoundly affecting, and the tension is riveting as each visa is checked. The stakes are high for these refugees, and here the novel soars.</p><h3>The New York Times -

While Iris and Emma go about their daily lives, they follow American reporter Frankie Bard on the radio as she delivers powerful and personal accounts from the London Blitz and elsewhere in Europe. While Trask waits for the return of her husband&mdash;a volunteer doctor stationed in England&mdash;James comes across a letter with valuable information that she chooses to hide. Blake captures two different worlds&mdash;a na&iuml;ve nation in denial and, across the ocean, a continent wracked with terror&mdash;with a deft sense of character and plot, and a perfect willingness to take on big, complex questions, such as the merits of truth and truth-telling in wartime.

								Entertainment Weekly</h3><p>The Postmistress, its cover emblazoned with a glowing blurb from The Help's Kathryn Stockett, will likely be snapped up by book clubs. There's both exquisite pain and pleasure to be found in these pages, which jump from the mass devastation in Europe to the intimate heartaches of an American small town. As a war rages, and the baby in Emma's belly grows, Frankie and Iris must answer an impossible question: When and how, if at all, should life-altering news be delivered? The ending is a bit of a miss. One final tragedy seems unnecessarily cruel. But in a novel about war, perhaps that is the point. A-</p><h3>New York Times

								Janet Maslin</h3><p>Sarah Blake has coaxed forth a book that hits hard and pushes buttons expertly. Not for nothing does its publisher emphasize the resemblance between THE POSTMISTRESS and THE HELP, Kathryn Stockett's socially conscious pulp best seller. Each of these novels appropriates galvanizing social issues in the service of a well-wrought tear-jerker....the real strength of THE POSTMISTRESS lies in its ability to strip away readers' defenses against stories of wartime uncertainty and infuse that chaos with wrenching immediacy and terror. Ms. Blake writes powerfully about the fragility of life and about Frankie's efforts to explain how a person can be present in one instant and then in the next, gone forever....The nobility on Ms. Blake's pages triumphs over the fear, which is one explanation of why this book will click in a major way.</p><h3>USA Today's "Life" section</h3><p>splendid novel about the power of words to change people and the world....The Postmistress possesses the sentimental quaintness of the 2008 hit The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, but its spark comes from its enduring message about the need for humanity to step up and fight anyone and anything that threatens our fragile moral code . . .In 2010, The Postmistress may stand alone, as did Kathryn Stockett's The Help (also published by Amy Einhorn) in 2009, as a refreshingly honest novel about how a handful of people can help change the world.
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Frankie Bard is a young female reporter in London during the Blitz, working with the likes of Edward R. Murrow and Eric Severeid. Her broadcasts make an impression on the residents of Franklin, MA&mdash;Dr. Will Fitch and wife Emma, garage owner Harry Vale, and postmaster Iris James&mdash;who in 1940&ndash;41 don't know how or if the war will affect them. Harry is sure the Germans are about to land on their beach, while, hearing Frankie talk of an orphaned boy, Emma and Will don't feel the news goes far enough. Iris insists that "there is an order and a reason" to everything, and "every letter sent&hellip;proves it." First novelist Blake doesn't let her work fall prey to easy sentimentality; this story is harsh and desperate, as indeed is war, but her writing is incisive and lush&#58; a house missing a piece of mortar, "as if it had been bitten"; a distracted Iris, with "sand&hellip;dribbling out of the bag of her attention." VERDICT Even readers who don't think they like historical novels will love this one and talk it up to their friends. Highly recommended for all fans of beautifully wrought fiction. [See Prepub Alert, LJ 10/1/09.]&mdash;Bette-Lee Fox, Library Journal
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In the years preceding the United States' entrance into World War II, radio journalist Frankie Bard broadcasts from London during the air raids. Among her listeners are several residents of a small Cape Cod town. Writing in starkly descriptive prose, novelist Blake (Grange House) offers a revealing and intimate look at this moment in history, moving back and forth between small-town America and war-torn Europe and intertwining the narratives of three unique women along the way. Actress/narrator Orlagh Cassidy (The Piano Teacher) does a superb job of rendering this quietly powerful story; highly recommended. [The Putnam hc also received a starred review, LJ 12/09.&mdash;Ed.]&mdash;Joyce Kessel, Villa Maria Coll., Buffalo</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Three women on the eve of America's involvement in World War II consider the volatile nature of truth in the face of tragedy. Iris James is postmistress for the town of Franklin on the tip of Cape Cod. Everyone's secrets pass through her hands, but Iris, a 40-year-old virgin, reveres the ethical standards her position confers, order imposed on the chaos. New to Franklin in September 1940 is Emma, young Dr. Will Fitch's bride, an orphan who hopes that marriage and the close community will bring her the family she's missed. While residents enjoy the quiet of fall on the Cape-everyone but Harry Vale, who perches on the upper floor of Town Hall looking out to sea for U-boats-they listen to the radio broadcasts of Frankie Bard, a pioneering female American journalist covering the Blitz in London. Her report about an orphaned boy prompts Will, reeling from the recent death of a patient during childbirth, to go to London and help the wounded in penance. Frankie briefly meets Will in a bomb shelter, where he makes a disturbing confession: He can't return to his life on the Cape; the war and his usefulness during it have made him happy. Upper-crust Frankie is also exhilarated by the war, but as she and Will exit the shelter the next morning, she sees him hit and killed by a taxi. Frankie's boss, Ed Murrow, sends her to the continent to interview Jewish refugees fleeing Germany; she also witnesses executions and realizes the enormity of the task ahead. Back on the Cape, Emma, heavily pregnant, doesn't know what to make of Will's disappearance. But Iris does; she confiscated the letter informing Emma of Will's death. Then Frankie shows up, surprised that everyone thinks Will is still alive. Theloose ends that plague every tale and the fractional nature of knowing are the central themes of this narrative, which plays with the idea of storytelling. Quietly effective work from first novelist Blake.
</p><h3>What People Are Saying</h3><p><strong>Howard Norman</strong><br>"The Postmistress is the fictional communique readers have waited for. Sarah Blake has brought small-town American life and ravaged Europe during WWII to us with cinematic immediacy. The romantic, harrowing -- and utterly inimitable-- story of radio journalist Frankie Bard (appalled yet intoxicated by tragedy as no character I've ever read before) contains the uncompromised sensibility found in the writings of Martha Gellhorn. The Postmistress belongs in what Gellhorn called "the permanent and necessary" library."--(Howard Norman, author of The Bird Artist and Devotion)
</p><br><p><strong>Sena Jeter Naslund</strong><br>"An unforgettable, insightful, and compelling novel The Postmistress engages the reader's instincts at the deep level of fight or flight. For WWII radio reporter Frankie Bard, however, the gut response to horror is see and tell. Sarah Blake's prose perfectly recreates the cadences of passion and of the inner life while also conjuring up the wrenching, nightmare suspense of history in the making."--(Sena Jeter Naslund, author of Ahab's Wife and Abundance, a Novel of Marie Antoinette)
</p><br><p><strong>Andre Dubus III</strong><br>"Some novels we savor for their lapidary prose, others for their flesh and blood characters, and still others for a sweeping narrative arc that leaves us light-headed and changed; Sarah Blake's masterful, THE POSTMISTRESS, serves us all this and more. Compassionate, insightful, and unsentimental, this masterful novel is told in a rare and highly successful omniscient voice, one that delves deeply into the seemingly random nature of love and war and story itself. This is a superb book!"
</p><br><p><strong>Kathryn Stockett</strong><br>"Great books give you a feeling that you miss all day until you finally get to crawl back inside those pages again. The Postmistress is one of those rare books. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. Sarah Blake seamlessly moves from inside one character to another, in a novel that reminds us of a time when the news travelled from post to paper to radio and that is how we learned about the world. The Postmistress made me homesick for a time before I was even born. What's remarkable, however, is how relevant the story is to our present-day times. A beautifully written, thought provoking novel that I'm telling everyone I know to read."--(Kathryn Stockett, author of The Help)
