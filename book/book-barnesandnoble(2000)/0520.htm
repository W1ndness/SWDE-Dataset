											After reading reviews of childcare books I chose this one.  I have a 15-month old and thought that this book would provide useful information for a few more years.  When my son was an infant I used &quot;What to Expect the First Year,&quot; so in this book I have only read the chapter titled &quot;Your One-Year old.&quot;  It gave valuable information about relevant topics such as weaning from the bottle, dealing with tantrums, recommended forms of discipline and nutrition.  I think this book is up-to-date and trustworthy because it is based on research and the expert opinion of many pediatricians, not just one or two authors that have theories about child-rearing.  Also the information seems to be unbiased and it doesn't make you feel like you have to be a perfect parent, either.  The only problem that I found with it is that the index is not organized very well, I feel like you have to do some digging if you want to find info. on a particular topic.  Also the chapter about emergency information has some charts that are difficult to read due to small print.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>THE MOST UP-TO-DATE, EXPERT ADVICE FOR MOTHERS, FATHERS, AND CARE PROVIDERS FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS<b><br><br></b>From the most respected organization on child health comes this essential resource for all parents who want to provide the very best care for their children.

From the moment&#160;you first hold this miracle of life in your arms, your world will be&#160;broader and richer. You will experience a flood of feelings, some of&#160;wonder and joy and others of confusion and of being overwhelmed&#160;and wondering whether you can ever measure up to the needs of your&#160;new baby. These are feelings you could barely imagine before&mdash;feelings&#160;that no one can truly experience without having a child.<br><br>&#160;Even describing them can be difficult because the bond between&#160;parent and child is so intensely personal. Why do tears come to your&#160;eyes the first time your baby smiles or reaches for you? Why are you&#160;so proud of her first words? Why does your heart suddenly start to&#160;pound the first time you watch her stumble and fall? The answer lies&#160;in the unique two- way giving relationship between you and your&#160;child.<br><br><i>Your Child&rsquo;s Gifts to You</i>&#160;<br><br>Although simple, your child&rsquo;s gifts to you are powerful enough to change your&#160;life positively.<br><br>&#160;UNQUALIFIED LOVE. From birth, you are the center of your child&rsquo;s universe.&#160;He gives you his love without question and without demand. As he gets older,&#160;he will show this love in countless ways, from showering you with his first&#160;smiles to giving you his handmade Valentines. His love is filled with admiration,&#160;affection, loyalty, and an intense desire to please you.&#160;<br><br>ABSOLUTE TRUST. Your child believes in you. In her eyes, you are strong, capable,&#160;powerful, and wise. Over time, she will demonstrate this trust by relaxing&#160;when you are near, coming to you with problems, and proudly pointing you&#160;out to others. Sometimes she also will lean on you for protection from things&#160;that frighten her, including her own sensitivities. For example, in your presence&#160;she may try out new skills that she would never dare to try alone or with a&#160;stranger. She trusts you to keep her safe.&#160;<br><br>THE THRILL OF DISCOVERY. Having a child gives you a unique chance to rediscover&#160;the pleasure and excitement of childhood. Although you cannot relive&#160;your life through your child, you can share in his delight as he explores the&#160;world. In the process, you probably will discover abilities and talents you never&#160;dreamed you possessed. Feelings of empathy mixed with growing selfawareness&#160;will help shape your ability to play and interact with your growing&#160;child. Discovering things together, whether they are new skills or words or&#160;ways to overcome obstacles, will add to your experience and confidence as a&#160;parent and will better prepare you for new challenges that you never even envisioned.&#160;<br><br><i>Your Child&rsquo;s Gifts to You</i>&#160;<br><br>THE HEIGHTS OF EMOTION. Through your child, you will experience new&#160;heights of joy, love, pride, and excitement. You probably also will experience&#160;anxiety, anger, and frustration. For all those delicious moments when you hold&#160;your baby close and feel her loving arms around your neck, there are bound to&#160;be times when you feel you cannot communicate. The extremes sometimes become&#160;sharper as your child gets older and seeks to establish her independence.&#160;<br><br>The same child who at three dances across the room with you may at four have&#160;a rebellious and active period that surprises you. The extremes are not contradictions,&#160;but simply a reality of growing up. For you as a parent, the challenge&#160;is to accept and appreciate all the feelings with which your child expresses himself&#160;and arouses in you, and to use them in giving him steady guidance.&#160;<br><br><i>The Gifts You Give Your Child&#160;<br></i><br>As his parent, you have many vital gifts to offer your child in return. Some are&#160;subtle, but all are very powerful. Giving them will make you a good parent. Receiving&#160;them will help your child become a healthy, happy, capable individual.&#160;<br><br>UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. Love lies at the core of your relationship with your&#160;child. It needs to flow freely in both directions. Just as she loves you without&#160;question, you must give her your love and acceptance absolutely. Your love&#160;shouldn&rsquo;t depend on the way she looks or behaves. It shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a reward&#160;or withheld as a threat. Your love for your child is constant and indisputable,&#160;and it&rsquo;s up to you to convey that, especially when she misbehaves and needs to have limits set or behavior corrected. Love must be held separate and&#160;above any fleeting feelings of anger or frustration over her conduct. Never confuse&#160;the actions with the child. The more secure she feels in your love, the more&#160;self- assurance she will have as she grows up.&#160;<br><br>SELF- ESTEEM. One of your most important gifts as a parent is to help your&#160;child develop self- esteem. It&rsquo;s not an easy or quick process. Self- respect, confidence,&#160;and belief in oneself, which are the building blocks of self- esteem, take&#160;years to become firmly established. Your child needs your steady support and&#160;encouragement to discover his strengths. He needs you to believe in him as he&#160;learns to believe in himself. Loving him, spending time with him, listening to&#160;him, and praising his accomplishments are all part of this process. On other occasions,&#160;helping him modify his troubling behaviors in ways that aren&rsquo;t punitive&#160;or hurtful, but constructive, is just as important to building a firm self- esteem.&#160;If he is confident of your love, admiration, and respect, it will be easier for him&#160;to develop the solid self- esteem he needs to grow up happy and emotionally&#160;healthy.&#160;<br><br>VALUES AND TRADITIONS. Regardless of whether you actively try to pass on&#160;your values and beliefs to your child, she is bound to absorb some of them just&#160;by living with you. She&rsquo;ll notice how disciplined you are in your work, how&#160;deeply you hold your beliefs, and whether you practice what you preach. She&rsquo;ll&#160;participate in family rituals and traditions and think about their significance.&#160;You can&rsquo;t expect or demand that your child subscribe to all your opinions, but&#160;you can present your beliefs honestly, clearly, and thoughtfully, in keeping with&#160;the child&rsquo;s age and maturity level. Give her guidance and encouragement, not&#160;only commands. Encourage questions and discussions, when age and language&#160;permit, instead of trying to force your values on your child. If your beliefs are&#160;well reasoned and if you are true to them, she probably will adopt many of&#160;them. If there are inconsistencies in your actions&mdash;something we all live with&mdash;&#160;often your child will make that clear to you, either subtly by his behavior or,&#160;when he is older, more directly by disagreeing with you. The road to developing&#160;values is not straight and unerring. It demands flexibility built on firm foundations.&#160;Self- awareness, a willingness to listen to your child and change when&#160;appropriate, and, above all, a demonstration of your commitment to traditions&#160;will best serve your relationship with your child. While the choice of values and&#160;principles ultimately will be hers to make, she depends on you to give her the&#160;foundation through your thoughts, shared ideas, and, most of all, your actions&#160;and deeds.&#160;<br><br>JOY IN LIFE. Your baby doesn&rsquo;t need to be taught to be joyful, but he does need&#160;your encouragement and support to let his natural enthusiasm fly free. The&#160;more joyful you are, particularly when you are with him, the more delightful&#160;life will seem to him and the more eagerly he will embrace it. When he hears&#160;music, he&rsquo;ll dance. When the sun shines, he&rsquo;ll turn his face skyward. When he&#160;feels happy, he&rsquo;ll laugh. This exuberance often is expressed through his being&#160;attentive and curious, willing to explore new places and things, and eager to&#160;take in the world around him and incorporate the new images, objects, and&#160;people into his own growing experience. Remember, different babies have different&#160;temperaments&mdash;some are more apparently exuberant than others, some&#160;are more noisily rambunctious, some are more playful, some are more reserved&#160;and quiet. Still others are more even- keeled, mixtures of the two extremes. But&#160;all babies demonstrate their joy in life in their own ways, and you as the parent&#160;will discover what those ways are and will nurture your child&rsquo;s joy.&#160;<br><br>GOOD HEALTH. Your child&rsquo;s health depends significantly on the care and guidance&#160;you offer her during these early years. You begin during pregnancy by taking&#160;good care of yourself and by arranging for obstetric and pediatric care. By&#160;taking your child to the doctor regularly for checkups and consultations, keeping&#160;her safe from injuries, providing a nutritious diet, and encouraging exercise&#160;throughout childhood, you help protect and strengthen her body. You&rsquo;ll also&#160;need to maintain good health habits yourself, while avoiding unhealthy ones,&#160;such as smoking, excessive drinking, drug use, and lack of adequate physical&#160;activity. In this way, you&rsquo;ll give your child a healthy example to follow as she&#160;grows up.&#160;<br><br>SECURE SURROUNDINGS. You naturally want to give your child a safe, comfortable&#160;home. This means more than a warm place to sleep and a collection of&#160;toys. As important as it is to provide shelter that is physically safe and secure,&#160;it is even more important to create a home that is emotionally secure with a&#160;minimum of stress and a maximum of consistency and love. Your child can&#160;sense problems between other family members and may be very troubled by&#160;them, so it&rsquo;s important that all family problems, even minor conflicts, be dealt&#160;with directly and resolved as quickly as possible through cooperation. This may&#160;entail seeking advice, but remember, your family&rsquo;s well- being helps maintain an&#160;environment that promotes your child&rsquo;s development and will allow him to&#160;achieve his potential. The family&rsquo;s dealing effectively with conflicts or differences&#160;ultimately will help him feel secure in his ability to manage conflicts and&#160;disagreements and will provide him with a positive example for resolving his&#160;own challenges.&#160;<br><br>SKILLS AND ABILITIES. As your child grows up, she&rsquo;ll spend most of her time&#160;developing and polishing a variety of skills and abilities in all areas of her life.&#160;You should help her as much as possible by encouraging her and providing the&#160;equipment and instruction she needs. Books, magazines, play groups, and&#160;preschool will quickly take on a central role as your toddler becomes a&#160;preschooler. But it&rsquo;s important not to forget some of the most important learning&#160;tools&#58; Your child will learn best when she feels secure, confident, and loved;&#160;she will learn best when information is presented in a way that she will respond&#160;to positively. Some information is best presented through play&mdash;the language of&#160;children. Young children learn a tremendous amount through play, especially&#160;when with parents or playmates. Other information is best learned or incorporated&#160;through actual experience. This may mean learning through exposure to&#160;diverse places, people, activities, and experiences. Other things are learned&#160;through stories, picture books, magazines, and activity books. Still other things&#160;are learned by watching&mdash;sometimes just watching you, sometimes watching&#160;other children or adults. Preschool experiences also promote socialization.&#160;If you enjoy learning and making discovery fun for your child, she soon will&#160;recognize that achievement can be a source of personal satisfaction as well as a&#160;way to please you. The secret is to give her the opportunities and let her learn&#160;as best fits her style and at her own rate.<br><br><i>How to Make Giving a Part&#160;of Your Daily Family Life&#160;<br></i><br>The back- and- forth sharing of these gifts between you and your child will foster&#160;your relationship and nurture your child&rsquo;s development. Much like learning&#160;a new dance, working out the actual steps in giving is not always going to be&#160;easy. But it will happen with time and patience, and with your own commitment&#160;to strengthen the parent- child relationship.&#160;<br><br>Giving your child the guidance and support that he needs to grow up&#160;healthy involves all the skills of parenthood&#58; nurturing, guiding, protecting,&#160;sharing, and serving as an example or model. Like other skills, these must be&#160;learned and perfected through practice. Some will be easier for you than others.&#160;Some will seem easier on certain days than on others. These variations are a&#160;normal part of raising a child, but they do make the job challenging. The following&#160;suggestions will help you make the most of your natural parenting skills&#160;so you can give your child the best possible start.&#160;<br><br>ENJOY YOUR CHILD AS AN INDIVIDUAL. Recognize that your child is&#160;unique&mdash;different from everyone else&mdash;and appreciate her special qualities.&#160;Discover her special needs and strengths, her moods and vulnerabilities, and especially&#160;her sense of humor, which starts to show itself early in infancy. Let her&#160;show you the joy of play. The more you enjoy your child and appreciate her individuality, the more successful you&rsquo;ll be in helping her develop a sense of trust,&#160;security, and self- esteem. You&rsquo;ll also have a lot more fun being a parent!&#160;<br><br>EDUCATE YOURSELF. You probably know much more than you think you do&#160;about being a parent. You spent years observing your own parents and other&#160;families. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve cared for other children. And you have many instinctive&#160;responses that will help make you a giving parent. In other times, this probably&#160;would have been all the preparation you needed to raise a child. However,&#160;our society is extremely complex and is constantly changing. In order to guide&#160;their children in this new world, parents often benefit from some extra education.&#160;Talk to your pediatrician and other parents, and ask questions. Get to&#160;know other families with children the same age, and watch how these parents&#160;raise their children (for example, when are they protective and when do they let&#160;go, and how much responsibility do they expect of their children at various&#160;ages?). Also, read about issues and problems that affect your family. Contact&#160;your local religious organizations, school systems and PTAs, child care programs,&#160;parent education classes, and other groups that specialize in childrelated&#160;concerns. Often these groups serve as networks for concerned and&#160;interested parents. These networks will help you feel more comfortable and secure&#160;when issues seem puzzling or frustrating.&#160;<br><br>As you gather advice, sift through it for information that is right for you&#160;and your child. Much of what you receive will be very valuable, but not all of&#160;it. Because child rearing is such a personal process, there is bound to be disagreement.&#160;You are not obligated to believe everything you hear or read. In&#160;fact, one of the purposes of educating yourself is to protect your child from advice&#160;that does not fit your family. The more you know, the better equipped&#160;you&rsquo;ll be to decide what works best for your family.&#160;<br><br>BE A GOOD EXAMPLE. One of the ways your child shows her love for you is&#160;by imitating you. This is also one of the ways she learns how to behave, develop&#160;new skills, and take care of herself. From her earliest moments, she watches you&#160;closely and patterns her own behavior and beliefs after yours. Your examples&#160;become permanent images, which will shape her attitudes and actions for the&#160;rest of her life. Setting a good example for your child means being responsible,&#160;loving, and consistent not only with her but with all members of the family.&#160;Show your affection and nurture your relationships. If your child sees her parents&#160;communicating openly, cooperating, and sharing household responsibilities,&#160;she&rsquo;ll bring these skills to her own future relationships.&#160;<br><br>Setting good examples also means taking care of yourself. As an eager, wellmeaning&#160;parent, it&rsquo;s easy to concentrate so hard on your family that you lose&#160;sight of your own needs. That&rsquo;s a big mistake. Your child depends on you to be&#160;physically and emotionally healthy, and she looks to you to show her how to keep herself healthy. By taking care of yourself, you demonstrate your selfesteem,&#160;which is important for both you and your child. Getting a sitter and&#160;resting when you&rsquo;re overtired or ill teaches your child that you respect yourself&#160;and your needs. Setting aside time and energy for your own work or hobbies&#160;teaches your child that you value certain skills and interests and are willing to&#160;pursue them. By giving yourself some personal time (at least once a week), the&#160;easier it will be for you and your child to develop your own identities. That&#160;needs to occur as she grows older. She also will benefit from getting to know&#160;other trusted grown- ups by having them babysit, and at times involving your&#160;entire family in group activities with other families. Ultimately she will pattern&#160;some of her own habits after yours, so the healthier and happier you keep yourself,&#160;the better it will be for both of you.&#160;<br><br>You can set an example in still another important area, too, and that&rsquo;s in&#160;demonstrating tolerance and acceptance in an increasingly multicultural society.&#160;As the United States has become a melting pot of nationalities and cultures,&#160;it is more important than ever to teach tolerance to your child when relating to&#160;people of other racial, ethnic, and religious groups and alternate lifestyles.&#160;Make an effort to help your child understand and even celebrate diversity. No&#160;boy or girl is born prejudiced, but it can be learned at a very young age. By four&#160;years old, children are aware of differences among people. The way you relate&#160;to people in your life will provide a foundation for how your child will treat her&#160;peers and others throughout her childhood and adulthood. Let your child&#160;know that there are many similarities among people and make an effort to dispel&#160;stereotypes that she is exposed to, replacing them with the belief that all&#160;people deserve to be respected and valued.&#160;<br><br>SHOW YOUR LOVE. Giving love means more than just saying &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;&#160;Your child can&rsquo;t understand what the words mean unless you also treat him&#160;with love. Be spontaneous, relaxed, and affectionate with him. Give him plenty&#160;of physical contact through hugging, kissing, rocking, and playing. Take the&#160;time to talk, sing, and read with him every day. Listen and watch as he responds&#160;to you. By paying attention and freely showing your affection, you make him&#160;feel special and secure and lay a firm foundation for his self- esteem.&#160;<br><br>COMMUNICATE HONESTLY AND OPENLY. One of the most important skills&#160;you teach your child is communication. The lessons begin when she is a tiny&#160;baby gazing into your eyes and listening to your soothing voice. They continue&#160;as she watches and listens to you talking with other members of the family and,&#160;later, as you help her sort out her concerns, problems, and confusions. She&#160;needs you to be understanding, patient, honest, and clear with her. Good communication&#160;within a family is not always easy. It can be especially difficult&#160;when both parents are working, overextended, or under a great deal of stress,&#160;or when one person is depressed, ill, or angry. Preventing a communications&#160;breakdown requires commitment, cooperation among family members, and a&#160;willingness to recognize problems as they arise. Express your own feelings, and&#160;encourage your child to be equally open with you. Look for changes in her behavior&mdash;&#160;such as frequent or constant crying, irritability, sleep problems, or appetite&#160;loss&mdash;that may signal sadness, fear, frustration, or worry, and show her&#160;that you&rsquo;re aware of and understand these emotions. Ask questions, listen to&#160;the responses, and offer constructive suggestions.&#160;<br><br>Listen to yourself, as well, and consider what you say to your child before&#160;the words leave your mouth. It&rsquo;s sometimes easy to make harsh, even cruel,&#160;statements in anger or frustration that you don&rsquo;t really mean but that your child&#160;may never forget. Thoughtless comments or jokes that seem incidental to you&#160;may be hurtful to your child. Phrases like &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dumb question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&#160;bother me&rdquo; make your child feel worthless and unwanted and may seriously&#160;damage her self- esteem. If you constantly criticize or put her off, she also may&#160;back away from you. Instead of looking to you for guidance, she may hesitate&#160;to ask questions and may mistrust your advice. Like everyone else, children&#160;need encouragement to ask questions and speak their minds. The more sensitive,&#160;attentive, and honest you are, the more comfortable she&rsquo;ll feel being honest&#160;with you.&#160;<br><br>SPEND TIME TOGETHER. You cannot give your child all that he needs if you&#160;only spend a few minutes a day with him. In order to know you and feel confident&#160;of your love, he has to spend a great deal of time with you, both physically&#160;and emotionally. Spending this time together is possible even if you have outside&#160;commitments. You can work full- time and still spend some intimate time&#160;with your child every day. The important thing is that it be time devoted just to&#160;him, meeting his needs and your needs together. Is there any fixed amount? No&#160;one can really say. One hour of quality time is worth more than a day of being&#160;in the same house but in different rooms. You can be at home full- time and&#160;never give him the undivided attention he requires. It&rsquo;s up to you to shape your&#160;schedule and direct your attention so that you meet his needs.&#160;<br><br>It may help to set aside a specific block of time for your child each day and&#160;devote it to activities he enjoys. Also make an effort to include him in all family&#160;activities&mdash;meal preparation, mealtimes, and so forth. Use these times to&#160;talk about each other&rsquo;s problems (do be attentive, however, to overburdening&#160;your child with adult problems; kids don&rsquo;t need to shoulder your anxieties),&#160;personal concerns, and the day&rsquo;s events.&#160;<br><br>If you&rsquo;re a working parent, your attentiveness to your child when you&rsquo;re together&#160;will help ensure that he is well adjusted and well loved. If your child is&#160;well taken care of when you&rsquo;re at work, he will thrive regardless of your hours&#160;spent away on the job.&#160;<br><br>NURTURE GROWTH AND CHANGE. When your child is a newborn, it may be&#160;difficult for you to imagine her ever growing up, and yet your main purpose as&#160;a parent is to encourage, guide, and support her growth. She depends on you to&#160;provide the food, protection, and health care her body needs to grow properly,&#160;as well as the guidance her mind and spirit need to make her a healthy, mature&#160;individual. Instead of resisting change in your child, your job is to welcome and&#160;nurture it.&#160;<br><br>Guiding your child&rsquo;s growth involves a significant amount of discipline,&#160;both for you and for your child. As she becomes increasingly independent, she&#160;needs rules and guidelines to help her find what she can do and grow from&#160;there. You need to provide this framework for her, establishing rules that are&#160;appropriate for each stage of development and adjusting them as your child&#160;changes so they encourage growth instead of stifling it.&#160;<br><br>Confusion and conflict do not help your child to mature. Consistency does.&#160;Make sure that everyone who cares for her understands and agrees on the way&#160;she is being raised and the rules she&rsquo;s expected to follow. Establish policies for&#160;all her care providers to observe when she misbehaves, and adjust these policies&#160;along with the rules as she becomes more responsible.&#160;<br><br>You also should create an environment that encourages the healthy brain&#160;development of your child. His world&mdash;including where he lives and plays and&#160;whom he interacts with&mdash;will affect how his brain grows. Your child&rsquo;s environment&#160;and experiences need to be nurtured constantly, with warm and loving&#160;care providers who give him the freedom to explore and learn safely. (Throughout&#160;this book, you&rsquo;ll find guidelines on ensuring the optimal development of&#160;your child&rsquo;s brain.)&#160;<br><br>MINIMIZE FRUSTRATIONS AND MAXIMIZE SUCCESS. One of the ways your&#160;child develops self- esteem is by succeeding. The process starts in the crib with&#160;his very first attempts to communicate and use his body. If he achieves his goals&#160;and receives approval, he soon begins to feel good about himself and eager to&#160;take on greater challenges. If, instead, he&rsquo;s prevented from succeeding and his&#160;efforts are ignored, eventually he may become so discouraged that he quits trying&#160;and either withdraws or becomes angry and even more frustrated.&#160;<br><br>As a parent, you must try to expose your child to challenges that will help&#160;him discover his abilities and achieve successes while simultaneously preventing&#160;him from encountering obstacles or tasks likely to lead to too great a series of&#160;frustrations and defeats. This does not mean doing his work for him or keeping&#160;him from tasks you know will challenge him. Success is meaningless unless it&#160;involves a certain amount of struggle. However, too much frustration in the&#160;face of challenges that really are beyond your child&rsquo;s current abilities can be&#160;self- defeating and perpetuate a negative self- image. The key is to moderate the&#160;challenges so they&rsquo;re within your child&rsquo;s reach while asking him to stretch a bit.&#160;For example, try to have toys that are appropriate for his age level, neither too&#160;basic for him nor too difficult for him to handle. See if you can find a variety of&#160;playmates, some older and some younger. Invite your child to help you around&#160;the house and have him do chores as he gets older, but don&rsquo;t expect more of him&#160;than he realistically can manage.&#160;<br><br>As you raise your child, it&rsquo;s easy to get carried away by your hopes and&#160;dreams for him. You naturally want him to have the best education, all possible&#160;opportunities, and eventually a successful career and lifestyle. But be careful&#160;not to confuse your own wishes with his choices. In our highly competitive&#160;society, a great deal of pressure is placed on children to perform. Some&#160;preschools have entrance requirements. In some professions and sports, children&#160;are considered out of the running if they haven&rsquo;t begun training by age ten.&#160;In this atmosphere, the popularity of programs that promise to turn &ldquo;ordinary&#160;babies&rdquo; into &ldquo;super babies&rdquo; is understandable. Many well- meaning parents&#160;want desperately to give their children a head start on lifetime success. Unfortunately,&#160;this is rarely in the children&rsquo;s best interests. In fact, there is a lack of&#160;evidence that these rigorous, early- training programs can actually produce&#160;&ldquo;super babies.&rdquo; Achieving a balanced, moderate approach is the key to meeting&#160;expectations and avoiding frustration and disappointment for both you and&#160;your child.&#160;<br><br>Children who are pressured to perform early in life do not learn better or&#160;achieve higher skills over the long run than do other children. On the contrary,&#160;the effects of psychological and emotional pressures may be so negative that the&#160;child develops learning or behavioral problems. If a child is truly gifted, he&#160;might be able to handle the early- learning barrage and develop normally, but&#160;most gifted children require less pressure, not more. If their parents push them,&#160;they may feel overloaded and become anxious. If they don&rsquo;t live up to their parents&rsquo;&#160;expectations, they may feel like failures and worry that they&rsquo;ll lose their&#160;parents&rsquo; love. This kind of chronic stress and so- called &ldquo;adverse childhood experiences&rdquo;&#160;(see page xxxiii) can even have a negative impact on brain development&#160;and keep children from reaching their own innate potential.&#160;<br><br>Your child needs understanding, security, and opportunity geared to his&#160;own special gifts, needs, and developmental timetable. These things cannot be&#160;packaged in a program and they don&rsquo;t guarantee the future, but they will make&#160;him a success on his own terms.&#160;</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="product-related"><div class="btb-dsl-tc"><div class="btb-dsl-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-tc-acc"><div class="pr-width"><div class="wrap2lt"><h3 class="pr-selected accord-default-open"><a name="relatedAcc" href="#categoryTitle_Acc" data-cmelementid="Related Subjects_Accordion">Related Subjects</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on"><ul><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=914442">Infants &amp; Toddlers</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=914431">Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=914440">Family - Assorted Topics</a></li></ul></div><div class="wrap2lt booksByThisAuthor"><h3 class="pr-selected"><a name="booksByThisAuthorAcc" href="#booksByThisAuthor_Acc" data-cmelementid="BooksByThisAuthor_Accordion" onclick="WebService.initialize({url:'http://services.barnesandnoble.com/v02_00/ProductSearch?Contributor=American+Academy+Of+Pediatrics&amp;ProductType=Book&amp;ProductSort=Relevance&amp;ProductDetail=Brief&amp;Start=1&amp;Size=6&amp;AppId=bntemp&amp;bnoutput=jsonstring&amp;bncallback=webservicecallback', outputNode:document.getElementById('obbta'), StyleSheet:genericStyleSheet, moreLink:'http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=American+Academy+Of+Pediatrics', isBTOB:'false', ean:'9780553386301'});">More by This Author</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on" id="obbta"><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif" alt="loading animation"> loading...
