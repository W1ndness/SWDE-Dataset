This was before milk carton photos and public service announcements, she tells us; back in 1973, when Susie mysteriously disappeared, people still believed these things didn't happen. In the sweet, untroubled voice of a precocious teenage girl, Susie relates the awful events of her death and her own adjustment to the strange new place she finds herself. It looks a lot like her school playground, with the good kind of swing sets. With love, longing, and a growing understanding, Susie watches her family as they cope with their grief, her father embarks on a search for the killer, her sister undertakes a feat of amazing daring, her little brother builds a fort in her honor and begin the difficult process of healing. In the hands of a brilliant novelist, this story of seemingly unbearable tragedy is transformed into a suspenseful and touching story about family, memory, love, heaven, and living.</strong>

											The book the Lovley Bones is a realistic fiction book written by Alice Sebold. This is the story about a fourteen year old girl who is murdered and watches from heaven as her murderer tries to get away with what he has done and her family slowly falls apart.It is a story of a family who is trying to forget the tragedies that have happened but can't. I would recomend this amazing book to any teenager who loves a suspenceful book.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Lucky/Alice-Sebold/e/9780316096195/?pv=y">Lucky</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Wherever-Nina-Lies/Lynn-Weingarten/e/9780545066334/?pv=y">Wherever Nina Lies</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>10 year span??- it felt like 10 years reading it!!<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1400274_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780316666343_BK_24_1400274" href="#previewReview_1400274" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 04, 2010: 
											the first chapter was AMAZING. but then...it just dragged...dragged...and dragged... I put it on hold for 4 months so technically it was my &quot;S****er Book&quot; (a book where i put in my bathroom and read it for when you know...) this book was in a ten year span but it felt like i was reading it for 10 FLIPPIN YEARS! it was SO stressful! the middle was SO SLOW, that i couldn't take it anymore. At one point i threw the book against the wall! it was a sad story. i liked the ending but it just makes you mad. you wish the middle was as good as the beginning and the end. honestly, this book wasn't a waste of my life..but close to it.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/37140000/37141204.JPG" alt="" height="165" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Alice Sebold</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Long Beach, California</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>1963</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A., Syracuse University; studied poetry, University of Houston, 1984-85; M.F.A. in fiction, UC-Irvine, 1998</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>As Alice Sebold relates in her chilling memoir <i>Lucky</i>, she was considered fortunate for surviving a violent, devastating rape in her freshman year at Syracuse University. The woman before her had not been so "lucky": She was murdered and dismembered.<P>    The shadow of this fact survives in Sebold's acclaimed bestseller <i>The Lovely Bones</I>, which is narrated by another not-so-lucky victim from beyond the grave. It's such a maudlin premise that the book <i>shouldn't</i> have been successful -- in fact, Sebold's editor has told the author that the manuscript never would have been bought if she had been told what it was about before reading it.<P>    But in her ability to convey the brutal details of crime and its aftermath -- both the imagined instance and the real -- Sebold proved herself  a gripping writer. In a style that is straightforward but more than reportorial, she projected in <i>The Lovely Bones</i> the pitch-perfect voice of a dead 14-year-old girl who, from her vantage point in heaven, remains engaged with life on earth. The book was a sensation and appeared on most "best books" lists for 2002. <p>    Five years later, Sebold produced <I>The Almost Moon</I>, the chilling tale of a woman driven by circumstances to commit an unspeakable act. The novel begins with one of the most arresting first lines in recent memory: "When all is said and done, killing my mother came easily."<p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Sebold is married</b> to author Glen David Gold, author of <i>Carter Beats the Devil</i>. The two met when Sebold was in the fiction writing program at University of California, Irvine.<p>    <b>Part of the aftermath</b> of Sebold's traumatic rape in college was a long period of self-abuse, including heroin addiction. After a hard trial in New York trying (and failing) to get published, Sebold decided to leave the city and ultimately applied to grad school at Irvine. ''I couldn't handle the rejection and the failure anymore...and the 'almost' of it all,'' she told <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>. ''Everybody from New York has their almost-but-not-quite story, and I just felt like I don't want to be walking around on the planet trotting out mine.'' <p>  <b>Sebold says that</b> her continued failures ended up creating a good mindset for her writing. "After a while, you don't think what can't be done and what can be done, because no one's going to care anyway," she said in an Associated Press interview. "You just go and have fun in your room, which is what, to me, art should be about anyway."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><b>From the July/August 2002 issue of <i>Book</i> magazine</b><p>    When Alice Sebold went to the police after her horrific rape, they told her another girl had been attacked in the same place -- and killed. In comparison, the cops said, she was lucky. Sebold didn't think so:  <BR>  <BR>  A freshman at Syracuse University, she felt like her life was over. But in 1999, she published a memoir about the brutal 1981 assault, titled <EM>Lucky</EM>. Now, more than two decades after the attack, that word might finally be an accurate description of a writer whose new book, <EM>The Lovely Bones</EM>, is being touted as one of the season's major titles, and of a woman who finds herself, much to her surprise, in love and married. "I have a lot to be grateful for," she says.  <BR>  <BR>  Not that she's left the darkness behind entirely. In <EM>The Lovely Bones</EM>, Sebold, 39, tells the story of a grieving family's struggle to rebuild after the eldest daughter is murdered. The book -- told from the 14-year-old girl's perspective in heaven -- is more about heaven than about death, more about comfort than pain. "I think it walks the landscape that few writers -- or people -- can enter," says friend and fellow writer Aimee Bender. "Alice does it with this incredible grace."  <BR>  <BR>  <EM>The Lovely Bones</EM> represents the realization of one of Sebold's lifelong goals that was sidetracked by her life. "It wasn't my dream to grow up, get raped and write a book about it," she says bluntly. "I always dreamed of being a novelist."  <BR>  <BR>  After graduating from Syracuse in 1984, Sebold spent some time at graduate school in Texas before she ended up living in projects on the east side of Manhattan. She pursued writing but, she says, failed miserably. Instead, she found herself piecing together a life of teaching, working in restaurants, drinking and taking drugs. She says she did things she's ashamed of and things she doesn't remember. She scaled the heights of the Manhattan Bridge one night, and she says she can't explain why.  <BR>  <BR>  After ten years in the city, Sebold fled for the West. In California she got a job as a caretaker of an arts colony, where she made $386 a month, lived in an electricity-free, cinder block-and-plywood cabin and tried to educate urbanites on the charms of rural life. She read and wrote by the glow of propane lights. It was a vast improvement over the life she had abandoned. "All of this," Sebold says, "seemed easier than trying to make it as a writer while living in the East Village, wondering what pair of black pants to wear."  <BR>  <BR>  But she still wanted to write. So when she was accepted in 1995 to the prestigious MFA program at the University of California at Irvine, Sebold left the wilderness. At Irvine she began <EM>Lucky</EM> and started something else as well: a relationship with fellow writer Glen David Gold, who last year published the acclaimed <EM>Carter Beats the Devil</EM>. "Glen came in late to orientation and couldn't get his motorcycle helmet off, so he had to sit through orientation with his helmet on," Sebold recalls. "We immediately hit it off."  <BR>  <BR>  If falling for someone because he couldn't get out of a helmet sounds a little, well, odd, that's about right. "I have always felt extremely weird," she says proudly. "But I am very happy with my weirdnesses, and I want other people to be very happy with theirs." A photography book of chickens in headdresses is among her favorite possessions. She adopted her dog -- who, she was told, had been trained to sniff out drugs and bombs -- because she had a toothache and wanted to cheer herself up. And she locks up in certain kinds of conversations -- her husband says she'd rather sit in the corner reading Henry James than make small talk. "She doesn't do the 'Nice weather we've been having' thing," Gold says.  <BR>  <BR>  Gold -- who married Sebold in November 2001 after a courtship that included rides around Irvine on his purple BMW motorcycle and trips to the park for picnics in conjunction with basset hound festivals -- acknowledges that his wife has a few peculiar habits. Or, at least, has some unusual ways of dealing with tension: "When Alice has stress about certain people in her life, she sings rhyming couplets," Gold explains. "Some pretty hard R-rated lyrics will come around the house as Alice is expressing herself about how her day has been. So if you piss Alice off, you better hope your name is 'orange.' "  <BR>  <BR>  These days, though, Sebold has been able to put some distance between herself and her anger. After more than her fair share of harrowing moments, she will even acknowledge that she feels "very fortunate." And that writing dream? Two decades later, Alice Sebold just may become an overnight success.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers</b><br>Shockingly original and completely unforgettable, <i>The Lovely Bones</i> is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim.  Upsetting, you say?  Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.<p>  

The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school.  Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed.  But what the reader knows, her family does not.  Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished. <p> 

Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some.  But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part.  To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.<p>  

In the tradition of Alice McDermott, who wrote so elegantly about death in <i>Charming Billy,</i> Sebold unveils a book whose presence will linger with readers for a long, long time and signals the arrival of a novelist to be reckoned with.  
  <i>(Summer 2002 Selection)</i>
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><strong>When we first meet 14-year-old Susie Salmon, she is already in heaven. This was before milk carton photos and public service announcements, she tells us; back in 1973, when Susie mysteriously disappeared, people still believed these things didn't happen. In the sweet, untroubled voice of a precocious teenage girl, Susie relates the awful events of her death and her own adjustment to the strange new place she finds herself. It looks a lot like her school playground, with the good kind of swing sets. With love, longing, and a growing understanding, Susie watches her family as they cope with their grief, her father embarks on a search for the killer, her sister undertakes a feat of amazing daring, her little brother builds a fort in her honor and begin the difficult process of healing. In the hands of a brilliant novelist, this story of seemingly unbearable tragedy is transformed into a suspenseful and touching story about family, memory, love, heaven, and living.</strong>

</p><h3>New Yorker</h3><p>Sebold takes an enormous risk in her wonderfully strange d&eacute;but novel: her narrator, Susie Salmon, is dead -- murdered at the age of fourteen by a disturbed neighbor -- and speaks from the vantage of Heaven. Such is the author's skill that from the first page this premise seems utterly believable. Susie's voice has all the inflections of a smart teen-ager's, by turns inquisitive, sarcastic, and wistful; unplacated by Heaven, she watches as her family falls apart and her friends resume their lives without her. Sebold slips easily from the ordinary pleasures of a suburban childhood (cutting class; the first kiss) to moments of eerie beauty (a cloud of souls, "all of them clamoring at once inside the air"). If in the end she reaches too far, the book remains a stunning achievement.

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Sebold's first novel after her memoir, Lucky is a small but far  from minor miracle. Sebold has taken a grim, media-exploited  subject and fashioned from it a story that is both tragic and  full of light and grace. The novel begins swiftly. In the second  sentence, Sebold's narrator, Susie Salmon, announces, "I was  fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973." Susie is  taking a shortcut through a cornfield when a neighbor lures her  to his hideaway. The description of the crime is chilling, but  never vulgar, and Sebold maintains this delicate balance between  homely and horrid as she depicts the progress of grief for  Susie's family and friends. She captures the odd alliances  forged and the relationships ruined: the shattered father who  buries his sadness trying to gather evidence, the mother who  escapes "her ruined heart, in merciful adultery." At the same  time, Sebold brings to life an entire suburban community, from  the mortician's son to the handsome biker dropout who quietly  helps investigate Susie's murder. Much as this novel is about  "the lovely bones" growing around Susie's absence, it is also  full of suspense and written in lithe, resilient prose that by  itself delights. Sebold's most dazzling stroke, among many bold  ones, is to narrate the story from Susie's heaven (a place where  wishing is having), providing the warmth of a first-person  narration and the freedom of an omniscient one. It might be this  that gives Sebold's novel its special flavor, for in Susie's  every observation and memory of the smell of skunk or the touch  of spider webs is the reminder that life is sweet and funny and  surprising,. Agent, Henry Dunow. (July 3) Forecast: Sebold's memoir, Lucky, was the account of her rape in  1981, at Syracuse University. It is, of course, impossible to  read The Lovely Bones without considering the memoir, but the  novel moves Sebold effortlessly into literary territory. A long  list of writers including Michael Chabon and Jonathan  Franzen blurb The Lovely Bones, and booksellers should expect  the novel to move quickly; the early buzz has been considerable.  Foreign rights have been sold in England, France, Germany,  Holland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Spain and Sweden, with film  rights to Film Four.   Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Sebold, whose previous book, Lucky, told of her own rape and the  subsequent trial of her attacker, here offers a powerful first  novel, narrated by Susie Salmon, in heaven. Brutally raped and  murdered by a deceptively mild-mannered neighbor, Susie begins  with a compelling description of her death. During the next ten  years, she watches over her family and friends as they struggle  to cope with her murder. She observes their disintegrating lives  with compassion and occasionally attempts, sometimes  successfully, to communicate her love to them. Although the  lives of all who knew her well are shaped by her tragic death,  eventually her family and friends survive their pain and grief.  In Sebold's heaven, Susie continues to grow emotionally. She  learns that human existence is "the helplessness of being alive,  the dark bright pity of being human feeling as you went, groping  in corners and opening your arms to light all of it part of  navigating the unknown." Sebold's compelling and sometimes  poetic prose style and unsparing vision transform Susie's  tragedy into an ultimately rewarding novel. Highly recommended  for academic and public libraries.

</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p>Adult/High School-"I was fourteen when I was murdered on  December 6, 1973," says Susie Salmon in this intriguing novel.  Teens will immediately be drawn into this account of a girl who  was raped and killed, and tells her story from "heaven." She  realizes gradually that she is in an interim heaven until she  can let go of her earthly concerns. The place is like school  with Seventeen for a textbook and no teachers. On Earth, her  mother needs to leave the family for a time, her sister seems to  have Susie constantly in her thoughts, her young brother grows  into a pensive preteen, and her grief-stricken father spends  much of his time seeking out the murderer, even after it seems  that the police have given up. The narrator observes the  disparate ways her family and friends cope, and finally sees  that they are resolving their grief as "the lovely bones" of  their lives knit themselves around the empty space that was her  life. While the subject matter is grim, the telling is light and  frequently humorous-Susie remains 14 even though 8 years pass in  the other characters' lives. This novel will encourage  discussion. There is a slight feeling of magical realism, but  there is grounding in real adolescence.-Susan H. Woodcock,  Fairfax County Public Library, Chantilly, VA   Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>An extraordinary, almost-successful debut that treats sensational material with literary grace, narrated from heaven by the victim of a serial killer and pedophile. "My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973." These opening lines in Susie's thoroughly engaging voice show the same unblinking and straightforward charm that characterized Sebold's acclaimed memoir, Lucky (2002)-the true story of the author's surviving a brutal rape when she was a college freshman. Now, the fictional Susie recounts her own rape and-less lucky than the author-murder in a Pennsylvania suburb at the hands of a neighbor. Susie's voice is in exquisite control when describing the intensity and complexity of her family's grief, her longing for Ray Singh-the first and only boy to kiss her-and the effect her death has on Ruth, the lonely outsider whose body her soul happened to brush while rising up to a personal, whimsical, yet utterly convincing heaven. Rapt delight in the story begins to fade, though, as the narrative moves farther away in time from Susie's death and grows occasionally forced or superficial as Susie watches what happens over the next decade to everyone she knew on earth, including her killer. By the time Susie's soul enters Ruth's body long enough to make love to Ray, the author's ability to convince the reader has flagged. The closing third forces its way toward affirmative closure, and even the language changes tone: "The events that my death wrought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future." Works beautifully for so long as Susie simply tells the truth, then falters when theauthor goes for bigger truths about Love and Life. Still, mostly mesmerizing and deserving of the attention it's sure to receive.

<p>
13. In <i>The Lovely Bones</i>, adult relationships (Abigail and Jack, Ray's parents) are dysfunctional and troubled, whereas the young relationships (Lindsay and Samuel, Ray and Susie, Ray and Ruth) all seem to have depth, maturity, and potential. What is the author saying about young love? About the trials and tribulations of married life? 
<p>
14. Is Jack Salmon allowing himself to be swallowed up by his grief? Is there a point where he should have let go? How does his grief process affect his family? Is there something admirable about holding on so tightly to Susie's memory and not denying his profound sadness? 
<p>
15. Ray and Susie's final physical experience (via Ruth's body) seems to act almost as an exorcism that sweeps away, if only temporarily, Susie's memory of her rape. What is the significance of this act for Susie, and does it serve to counterbalance the violent act that ended Susie's life?

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3>		<P><B>One</B></P>


<P>My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie.
I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. In
newspaper photos of missing girls from the seventies, most
looked like me: white girls with mousy brown hair. This was before
kids of all races and genders started appearing on milk cartons
or in the daily mail. It was still back when people believed
things like that didn't happen.</P>

<P>In my junior high yearbook I had a quote from a Spanish poet
my sister had turned me on to, Juan Ram?n Jim?nez. It went like
this: "If they give you ruled paper, write the other way." I chose it
both because it expressed my contempt for my structured surroundings
? la the classroom and because, not being some dopey
quote from a rock group, I thought it marked me as literary. I was
a member of the Chess Club and Chem Club and burned everything
I tried to make in Mrs. Delminico's home ec class. My favorite
teacher was Mr. Botte, who taught biology and liked to
animate the frogs and crawfish we had to dissect by making them
dance in their waxed pans.</P>

<P>I wasn't killed by Mr. Botte, by the way. Don't think every person
you're going to meet in here is suspect. That's the problem.
You never know. Mr. Botte came to my memorial (as, may I add,
did almost the entire junior high school-I was never so popular)
and cried quite a bit. He had a sick kid. We all knew this, so
when he laughed at his own jokes, which were rusty way before I
had him, we laughed too, forcing it sometimes just to make him
happy. His daughter died a year and a half after I did. She had
leukemia, but I never saw her in my heaven.</P>

<P>My murderer was a man from our neighborhood. My mother
liked his border flowers, and my father talked to him once about
fertilizer. My murderer believed in old-fashioned things like
eggshells and coffee grounds, which he said his own mother had
used. My father came home smiling, making jokes about how the
man's garden might be beautiful but it would stink to high heaven
once a heat wave hit.</P>

<P>But on December 6, 1973, it was snowing, and I took a shortcut
through the cornfield back from the junior high. It was dark
out because the days were shorter in winter, and I remember how
the broken cornstalks made my walk more difficult. The snow
was falling lightly, like a flurry of small hands, and I was breathing
through my nose until it was running so much that I had to
open my mouth. Six feet from where Mr. Harvey stood, I stuck
my tongue out to taste a snowflake.</P>

<P>"Don't let me startle you," Mr. Harvey said.
Of course, in a cornfield, in the dark, I was startled. After I was
dead I thought about how there had been the light scent of
cologne in the air but that I had not been paying attention, or
thought it was coming from one of the houses up ahead.</P>

<P>"Mr. Harvey," I said.
"You're the older Salmon girl, right?"
"Yes."
"How are your folks?"</P>

<P>Although the eldest in my family and good at acing a science
quiz, I had never felt comfortable with adults.</P>

<P>"Fine," I said. I was cold, but the natural authority of his age,
and the added fact that he was a neighbor and had talked to my
father about fertilizer, rooted me to the spot.</P>

<P>"I've built something back here," he said. "Would you like to
see?"</P>

<P>"I'm sort of cold, Mr. Harvey," I said, "and my mom likes me
home before dark."</P>

<P>"It's after dark, Susie," he said.</P>

<P>I wish now that I had known this was weird. I had never told
him my name. I guess I thought my father had told him one of the
embarrassing anecdotes he saw merely as loving testaments to his
children. My father was the kind of dad who kept a nude photo
of you when you were three in the downstairs bathroom, the one
that guests would use. He did this to my little sister, Lindsey,
thank God. At least I was spared that indignity. But he liked to
tell a story about how, once Lindsey was born, I was so jealous
that one day while he was on the phone in the other room, I
moved down the couch&#151;he could see me from where he
stood&#151;and tried to pee on top of Lindsey in her carrier. This
story humiliated me every time he told it, to the pastor of our
church, to our neighbor Mrs. Stead, who was a therapist and
whose take on it he wanted to hear, and to everyone who ever said
"Susie has a lot of spunk!"</P>

<P>"Spunk!" my father would say. "Let me tell you about spunk,"
and he would launch immediately into his Susie-peed-on-Lindsey
story.</P>

<P>But as it turned out, my father had not mentioned us to Mr.
Harvey or told him the Susie-peed-on-Lindsey story.
Mr. Harvey would later say these words to my mother when he
ran into her on the street: "I heard about the horrible, horrible
tragedy. What was your daughter's name, again?"</P>

<P>"Susie," my mother said, bracing up under the weight of it, a
weight that she naively hoped might lighten someday, not knowing
that it would only go on to hurt in new and varied ways for
the rest of her life.</P>

<P>Mr. Harvey told her the usual: "I hope they get the bastard. I'm
sorry for your loss."</P>

<P>I was in my heaven by that time, fitting my limbs together, and
couldn't believe his audacity. "The man has no shame," I said to
Franny, my intake counselor. "Exactly," she said, and made her
point as simply as that. There wasn't a lot of bullshit in my heaven.</P>

<P>Mr. Harvey said it would only take a minute, so I followed him
a little farther into the cornfield, where fewer stalks were broken
off because no one used it as a shortcut to the junior high. My
mom had told my baby brother, Buckley, that the corn in the field
was inedible when he asked why no one from the neighborhood
ate it. "The corn is for horses, not humans," she said. "Not dogs?"
Buckley asked. "No," my mother answered. "Not dinosaurs?"
Buckley asked. And it went like that.</P>

<P>"I've made a little hiding place," said Mr. Harvey.
He stopped and turned to me.</P>

<P>"I don't see anything," I said. I was aware that Mr. Harvey was
looking at me strangely. I'd had older men look at me that way
since I'd lost my baby fat, but they usually didn't lose their marbles
over me when I was wearing my royal blue parka and yellow
elephant bell-bottoms. His glasses were small and round with
gold frames, and his eyes looked out over them and at me.</P>

<P>"You should be more observant, Susie," he said.
I felt like observing my way out of there, but I didn't. Why
didn't I? Franny said these questions were fruitless: "You didn't
and that's that. Don't mull it over. It does no good. You're dead
and you have to accept it."</P>

<P>"Try again," Mr. Harvey said, and he squatted down and
knocked against the ground.</P>

<P>"What's that?" I asked.
My ears were freezing. I wouldn't wear the multicolored cap
with the pompom and jingle bells that my mother had made me
one Christmas. I had shoved it in the pocket of my parka instead.
I remember that I went over and stomped on the ground near
him. It felt harder even than frozen earth, which was pretty hard.
"It's wood," Mr. Harvey said. "It keeps the entrance from collapsing.
Other than that it's all made out of earth."
"What is it?" I asked. I was no longer cold or weirded out by
the look he had given me. I was like I was in science class: I was
curious.</P>

<P>"Come and see."</P>

<P>It was awkward to get into, that much he admitted once we
were both inside the hole. But I was so amazed by how he had
made a chimney that would draw smoke out if he ever chose to
build a fire that the awkwardness of getting in and out of the hole
wasn't even on my mind. You could add to that that escape wasn't
a concept I had any real experience with. The worst I'd had to escape
was Artie, a strange-looking kid at school whose father was
a mortician. He liked to pretend he was carrying a needle full of
embalming fluid around with him. On his notebooks he would
draw needles spilling dark drips.</P>

<P>"This is neato!" I said to Mr. Harvey. He could have been the
hunchback of Notre Dame, whom we had read about in French
class. I didn't care. I completely reverted. I was my brother
Buckley on our day-trip to the Museum of Natural History in
New York, where he'd fallen in love with the huge skeletons on
display. I hadn't used the word <EM>neato</EM> in public since elementary
school.</P>

<P>"Like taking candy from a baby," Franny said.</P>

<P>I can still see the hole like it was yesterday, and it was. Life is a
perpetual yesterday for us. It was the size of a small room, the
mud room in our house, say, where we kept our boots and slickers
and where Mom had managed to fit a washer and dryer, one
on top of the other. I could almost stand up in it, but Mr. Harvey
had to stoop. He'd created a bench along the sides of it by the
way he'd dug it out. He immediately sat down.
"Look around," he said.</P>

<P>I stared at it in amazement, the dug-out shelf above him where
he had placed matches, a row of batteries, and a battery-powered
fluorescent lamp that cast the only light in the room-an eerie
light that would make his features hard to see when he was on top
of me.</P>

<P>There was a mirror on the shelf, and a razor and shaving cream.
I thought that was odd. Wouldn't he do that at home? But I guess
I figured that a man who had a perfectly good split-level and then
built an underground room only half a mile away had to be kind
of loo-loo. My father had a nice way of describing people like
him: "The man's a character, that's all."</P>

<P>So I guess I was thinking that Mr. Harvey was a character, and
I liked the room, and it was warm, and I wanted to know how he
had built it, what the mechanics of the thing were and where he'd
learned to do something like that.</P>

<P>But by the time the Gilberts' dog found my elbow three days
later and brought it home with a telling corn husk attached to it,
Mr. Harvey had closed it up. I was in transit during this. I didn't
get to see him sweat it out, remove the wood reinforcement, bag
any evidence along with my body parts, except that elbow. By the
time I popped up with enough wherewithal to look down at the
goings-on on Earth, I was more concerned with my family than
anything else.</P>

<P>My mother sat on a hard chair by the front door with her
mouth open. Her pale face paler than I had ever seen it. Her blue
eyes staring. My father was driven into motion. He wanted to
know details and to comb the cornfield along with the cops. I still
thank God for a small detective named Len Fenerman. He assigned
two uniforms to take my dad into town and have him point
out all the places I'd hung out with my friends. The uniforms kept
my dad busy in one mall for the whole first day. No one had told
Lindsey, who was thirteen and would have been old enough, or
Buckley, who was four and would, to be honest, never fully understand.</P>

<P>Mr. Harvey asked me if I would like a refreshment. That was
how he put it. I said I had to go home.</P>

<P>"Be polite and have a Coke," he said. "I'm sure the other kids
would."</P>

<P>"What other kids?"
"I built this for the kids in the neighborhood. I thought it could
be some sort of clubhouse."</P>

<P>I don't think I believed this even then. I thought he was lying,
but I thought it was a pitiful lie. I imagined he was lonely. We had
read about men like him in health class. Men who never married
and ate frozen meals every night and were so afraid of rejection
that they didn't even own pets. I felt sorry for him.</P>

<P>"Okay," I said, "I'll have a Coke."
In a little while he said, "Aren't you warm, Susie? Why don't
you take off your parka."</P>

<P>I did.
After this he said, "You're very pretty, Susie."
"Thanks," I said, even though he gave me what my friend
Clarissa and I had dubbed the skeevies.
"Do you have a boyfriend?"</P>

<P>"No, Mr. Harvey," I said. I swallowed the rest of my Coke,
which was a lot, and said, "I got to go, Mr. Harvey. This is a cool
place, but I have to go."
He stood up and did his hunchback number by the six dug-in
steps that led to the world. "I don't know why you think you're
leaving."</P>

<P>I talked so that I would not have to take in this knowledge: Mr.
Harvey was no character. He made me feel skeevy and icky now
that he was blocking the door.</P>

<P>"Mr. Harvey, I really have to get home."
"Take off your clothes."
"What?"</P>

<P>"Take your clothes off," Mr. Harvey said. "I want to check that
you're still a virgin."
"I am, Mr. Harvey," I said.</P>

<P>"I want to make sure. Your parents will thank me."
"My parents?"
"They only want good girls," he said.
"Mr. Harvey," I said, "please let me leave."
"You aren't leaving, Susie. You're mine now."</P>

<P>Fitness was not a big thing back then; <EM>aerobics</EM> was barely a
word. Girls were supposed to be soft, and only the girls we suspected
were butch could climb the ropes at school.</P>

<P>I fought hard. I fought as hard as I could not to let Mr. Harvey
hurt me, but my hard-as-I-could was not hard enough, not even
close, and I was soon lying down on the ground, in the ground,
with him on top of me panting and sweating, having lost his
glasses in the struggle.</P>

<P>I was so alive then. I thought it was <EM>the worst thing in the world</EM>
to be lying flat on my back with a sweating man on top of me. To
be trapped inside the earth and have no one know where I was.
I thought of my mother.</P>

<P>My mother would be checking the dial of the clock on her
oven. It was a new oven and she loved that it had a clock on it. "I
can time things to the minute," she told her own mother, a
mother who couldn't care less about ovens.</P>

<P>She would be worried, but more angry than worried, at my
lateness. As my father pulled into the garage, she would rush
about, fixing him a cocktail, a dry sherry, and put on an exasperated
face: "You know junior high," she would say. "Maybe it's
Spring Fling." "Abigail," my father would say, "how can it be
Spring Fling when it's snowing?" Having failed with this, my
mother might rush Buckley into the room and say, "Play with
your father," while she ducked into the kitchen and took a nip of
sherry for herself.</P>

<P>Mr. Harvey started to press his lips against mine. They were blubbery
and wet and I wanted to scream but I was too afraid and too
exhausted from the fight. I had been kissed once by someone I
liked. His name was Ray and he was Indian. He had an accent and
was dark. I wasn't supposed to like him. Clarissa called his large
eyes, with their half-closed lids, "freak-a-delic," but he was nice and
smart and helped me cheat on my algebra exam while pretending he
hadn't. He kissed me by my locker the day before we turned in our
photos for the yearbook. When the yearbook came out at the end of
the summer, I saw that under his picture he had answered the standard
"My heart belongs to" with "Susie Salmon." I guess he had
had plans. I remember that his lips were chapped.</P>

<P>"Don't, Mr. Harvey," I managed, and I kept saying that one
word a lot. <EM>Don't.</EM> And I said please a lot too. Franny told me that almost everyone begged <EM>"please"</EM> before dying.
"I want you, Susie," he said.</P>

<P>"Please," I said. "Don't," I said. Sometimes I combined them.
"Please don't" or "Don't please." It was like insisting that a key
works when it doesn't or yelling "I've got it, I've got it, I've got it"
as a softball goes sailing over you into the stands.
"Please don't."</P>

<P>But he grew tired of hearing me plead. He reached into the
pocket of my parka and balled up the hat my mother had made
me, smashing it into my mouth. The only sound I made after that
was the weak tinkling of bells.</P>

<P>As he kissed his wet lips down my face and neck and then
began to shove his hands up under my shirt, I wept. I began to
leave my body; I began to inhabit the air and the silence. I wept
and struggled so I would not feel. He ripped open my pants, not
having found the invisible zipper my mother had artfully sewn
into their side.</P>

<P>"Big white panties," he said.
I felt huge and bloated. I felt like a sea in which he stood and
pissed and shat. I felt the corners of my body were turning in on
themselves and out, like in cat's cradle, which I played with
Lindsey just to make her happy. He started working himself over
me.</P>

<br>
<P>"Susie! Susie!" I heard my mother calling. "Dinner is ready."
He was inside me. He was grunting.
"We're having string beans and lamb."
I was the mortar, he was the pestle.
"Your brother has a new finger painting, and I made apple
crumb cake."</P>

<br>
<P>Mr. Harvey made me lie still underneath him and listen to the
beating of his heart and the beating of mine. How mine skipped
like a rabbit, and how his thudded, a hammer against cloth. We
lay there with our bodies touching, and, as I shook, a powerful
knowledge took hold. He had done this thing to me and I had
lived. That was all. I was still breathing. I heard his heart. I
smelled his breath. The dark earth surrounding us smelled like
what it was, moist dirt where worms and animals lived their daily
lives. I could have yelled for hours.</P>

<P>I knew he was going to kill me. I did not realize then that I was
an animal already dying.</P>

<P>"Why don't you get up?" Mr. Harvey said as he rolled to the
side and then crouched over me.
His voice was gentle, encouraging, a lover's voice on a late
morning. A suggestion, not a command.
I could not move. I could not get up.</P>

<P>When I would not&#151;was it only that, only that I would not follow
his suggestion?&#151;he leaned to the side and felt, over his
head, across the ledge where his razor and shaving cream sat. He
brought back a knife. Unsheathed, it smiled at me, curving up in
a grin.</P>

<P>He took the hat from my mouth.
"Tell me you love me," he said.
Gently, I did.
The end came anyway.</P>

<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><p>My name was
Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on
December 6, 1973. In newspaper photos of missing girls from the seventies, most
looked like me: white girls with mousy brown hair. This was before kids of all
races and genders started appearing on milk cartons or in the daily mail. It
was still back when people believed things like that didn't happen.</p>

<p>In my junior
high yearbook I had a quote from a Spanish poet my sister had turned me on to,
Juan Ram?n Jim?nez. It went like this: "If they give you ruled paper, write the
other way." I chose it both because it expressed my contempt for my structured
surroundings ? la the classroom and because, not being some dopey quote from a
rock group, I thought it marked me as literary. I was a member of the Chess
Club and Chem Club and burned everything I tried to make in Mrs. Delminico's
home ec class. My favorite teacher was Mr. Botte, who taught biology and liked
to animate the
frogs and crawfish we had to dissect by making them dance in their waxed pans.</p>

<p>I wasn't killed by Mr.
Botte, by the way. Don't think every person you're going to meet in here is
suspect. That's the problem. You never know. Mr. Botte came to my memorial (as,
may I add, did almost the entire junior high school &#151;I was never so popular)
and cried quite a bit. He had a sick kid. We all knew this, so when he laughed
at his own jokes, which were rusty way before I had him, we laughed too,
forcing it sometimes just to make him happy. His daughter died a year and a
half after I did. She had leukemia, but I never saw her in my heaven.</p>

<p>My murderer was a man from
our neighborhood. My mother liked his border flowers, and my father talked to
him once about fertilizer. My murderer believed in old-fashioned things like
eggshells and coffee grounds, which he said his own mother had used. My father
came home smiling, making jokes about how the man's garden might be beautiful
but it would stink to high heaven once a heat wave hit.</p>

<p>But on December 6, 1973, it
was snowing, and I took a shortcut through the cornfield back from the junior
high. It was dark out because the days were shorter in winter, and I remember
how the broken cornstalks made my walk more difficult. The snow was falling
lightly, like a flurry of small hands, and I was breathing through my nose
until it was running so much that I had to open my mouth. Six feet from where
Mr. Harvey stood, I stuck my tongue out to taste a snowflake.</p>

<p>"Don't let me startle you,"
Mr. Harvey said.</p>

<p>Of course, in a cornfield,
in the dark, I was startled. After I was dead I thought about how there had
been the light scent of cologne in the air but that I had not been paying
attention, or thought it was coming from one of the houses up ahead. </p>

<p>"Mr. Harvey," I said.</p>

<p>"You're the older Salmon
girl, right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How are your folks?"</p>

<p>Although the eldest in my
family and good at acing a science quiz, I had never felt comfortable with
adults. </p>

<p>"Fine," I said. I was cold,
but the natural authority of his age, and the added fact that he was a neighbor
and had talked to my father about fertilizer, rooted me to the spot.</p>

<p>"I've built something back
here," he said. "Would you like to see?"</p>

<p>"I'm sort of cold, Mr.
Harvey," I said, "and my mom likes me home before dark."</p>

<p>"It's after dark, Susie," he
said.</p>

<p>I wish now that I had known
this was weird. I had never told him my name. I guess I thought my father had
told him one of the embarrassing anecdotes he saw merely as loving testaments
to his children. My father was the kind of dad who kept a nude photo of you
when you were three in the downstairs bathroom, the one that guests would use.
He did this to my little sister, Lindsey, thank God. At least I was spared that
indignity. But he liked to tell a story about how, once Lindsey was born, I was
so jealous that one day while he was on the phone in the other room, I moved
down the couch &#151;he could see me from where he stood &#151;and tried to pee on top of
Lindsey in her carrier. This story humiliated me every time he told it, to the
pastor of our church, to our neighbor Mrs. Stead, who was a therapist and whose
take on it he wanted to hear, and to everyone who ever said "Susie has a lot of
spunk!"</p>

<p>"Spunk!" my father would
say. "Let me tell you about spunk," and he would launch immediately into his
Susie-peed-on-Lindsey story.</p>

<p>But as it turned out, my
father had not mentioned us to Mr. Harvey or told him the Susie-peed-on-Lindsey
story.</p>

<p>Mr. Harvey would later say
these words to my mother when he ran into her on the street: "I heard about the
horrible, horrible tragedy. What was your daughter's name, again?"</p>

<p>"Susie," my mother said,
bracing up under the weight of it, a weight that she naively hoped might
lighten someday, not knowing that it would only go on to hurt in new and varied
ways for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>Mr. Harvey told her the
usual: "I hope they get the bastard. I'm sorry for your loss."</p>

<p>I was in my heaven by that
time, fitting my limbs together, and couldn't believe his audacity. "The man
has no shame," I said to Franny, my intake counselor. "Exactly," she said, and
made her point as simply as that. There wasn't a lot of bullshit in my heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Harvey said it would
only take a minute, so I followed him a little farther into the cornfield,
where fewer stalks were broken off because no one used it as a shortcut to the
junior high. My mom had told my baby brother, Buckley, that the corn in the
field was inedible when he asked why no one from the neighborhood ate it. "The
corn is for horses, not humans," she said. "Not dogs?" Buckley asked. "No," my
mother answered. "Not dinosaurs?" Buckley asked. And it went like that.</p>

<p>"I've made a little hiding
place," said Mr. Harvey.</p>

<p>He stopped and turned to me.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything," I
said. I was aware that Mr. Harvey was looking at me strangely. I'd had older
men look at me that way since I'd lost my baby fat, but they usually didn't
lose their marbles over me when I was wearing my royal blue parka and yellow
elephant bell-bottoms. His glasses were small and round with gold frames, and
his eyes looked out over them and at me. </p>

<p>"You should be more
observant, Susie," he said.</p>

<p>I felt like observing my way
out of there, but I didn't. Why didn't I? Franny said these questions were
fruitless: "You didn't and that's that. Don't mull it over. It does no good.
You're dead and you have to accept it."</p>

<p>"Try again," Mr. Harvey
said, and he squatted down and knocked against the ground.</p>

<p>"What's that?" I asked.</p>

<p>My ears were freezing. I
wouldn't wear the multicolored cap with the pompom and jingle bells that my
mother had made me one Christmas. I had shoved it in the pocket of my parka
instead.</p>

<p>I remember that I went over
and stomped on the ground near him. It felt harder even than frozen earth,

<p>As he kissed his wet lips
down my face and neck and then began to shove his hands up under my shirt, I
wept. I began to leave my body; I began to inhabit the air and the silence. I
wept and struggled so I would not feel. He ripped open my pants, not having
found the invisible zipper my mother had artfully sewn into their side.</p>

<p>"Big white panties," he
said.</p>

<p>I felt huge and bloated. I
felt like a sea in which he stood and pissed and shat. I felt the corners of my
body were turning in on themselves and out, like in cat's cradle, which I
played with Lindsey just to make her happy. He started working himself over me.</p>
<BR><BR>
<p>"Susie! Susie!" I heard my mother calling. "Dinner is ready."</p>

<p>He was inside me. He was
grunting.</p>

<p>"We're having string beans
and lamb."</p>

<p>I was the mortar, he was the
pestle.</p>

<p>"Your brother has a new
finger painting, and I made apple crumb cake."</p>
<BR><BR>
<p>Mr. Harvey made me lie still
underneath him and listen to the beating of his heart and the beating of mine.
How mine skipped like a rabbit, and how his thudded, a hammer against cloth. We
lay there with our bodies touching, and, as I shook, a powerful knowledge took
hold. He had done this thing to me and I had lived. That was all. I was still
breathing. I heard his heart. I smelled his breath. The dark earth surrounding
us smelled like what it was, moist dirt where worms and animals lived their
daily lives. I could have yelled for hours.</p>

<p>I knew he was going to kill
me. I did not realize then that I was an animal already dying.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get up?" Mr.
Harvey said as he rolled to the side and then crouched over me.</p>

<p>His voice was gentle,
encouraging, a lover's voice on a late morning. A suggestion, not a command.</p>

<p>I could not move. I could
not get up.</p>

<p>When I would not &#151;was it
only that, only that I would not follow his suggestion? &#151;he leaned to the side
and felt, over his head, across the ledge where his razor and shaving cream
sat. He brought back a knife. Unsheathed, it smiled at me, curving up in a
grin.</p>

<p>He took the hat from my
mouth.</p>

<p>"Tell me you love me," he
said.</p>

<p>Gently, I did.</p>

<p>The
end came anyway.</p>
