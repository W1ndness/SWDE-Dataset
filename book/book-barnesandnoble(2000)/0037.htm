</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Evanovich's latest "Between-the-Numbers" outing begins on St. Patrick's Day, when bounty hunter Stephanie Plum spots her Grandma Mazur dragging a mysterious duffel bag down the street. Then Grandma Mazur vanishes, and Stephanie's frantic mother begs Stephanie to track her down. Soon, Stephanie and her usual band of sidekicks (including sexy, inexplicably lucky Diesel) are on their way to Atlantic City and into a hilariously funny mess involving stolen mob money, a kidnapped horse and a thief/con artist who thinks he's a leprechaun. Lorelei King does the story justice, milking the prose for every drop of humor with her amusing, distinctive and superlatively accented rendition of each character. Her voices border on caricature, but that's entirely appropriate for this farcical, delightful New Jersey jelly doughnut of a novel, a satisfying snack for listeners anxiously awaiting Stephanie's 14th full-length adventure. <I>Simultaneous release with the St. Martin's hardcover (Reviews, Dec. 24).

Come to think of it, Ms. Plum has more than a little in common with her creator Janet Evanovich.<p>    Much like the panty-pushing Plum, Evanovich once made her trade in erotica as a romance novelist for the trashy Bantam series "Loveswept." Tiring of the genre and finding herself increasingly fixated on crime, mystery, and the kind of adventures she came to love through comic books like <I>Uncle Scrooge</I>, she decided to ditch steamy stories in favor of off-the-wall humor and feats of daring. As Evanovich said on her website, "after twelve romance novels I ran out of sexual positions and decided to move into the mystery genre." <p>    The resulting Stephanie Plum Mysteries reflect Evanovich's love for comics, toys, shoe-shopping, Cheez Doodles, and beer. Evanovich also created a memorable character that shares many of the author's distinctive traits, such as her self-effacing, dirty-minded wit. The Plum Mysteries, while often rambling and thin on plot, are never anything less than entertaining, hilarious, and refreshing in every way.<p>    Stephanie Plum made her debut in 1994's <I>One For the Money</I>, in which she tracked down Joe Morelli, an ex-cop and murder suspect who'd also been guilty of taking Stephanie's virginity when she was 18. The novel's sly mix of sexiness and childlike playfulness made for a sort of young adult novel for adults.     <P>Since then, the red-hot bounty hunter and a crew of misfits that includes retired hooker Lula, aging bail-jumper Eddie Decooch, and Plum's own hipster granny have romped their way "through the numbers," establishing Evanovich as one of the best and most inventive writers of "Strong Woman" mysteries and guaranteeing her a place on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller list.    <P>In 2004, Evanovich introduced a smart, savvy new series featuring Alexander "Barney" Barnaby, a sexy Baltimore car mechanic, NASCAR nut, and amateur sleuth with her own posse of delightful eccentrics. She's not Plum, but she's definitely a peach. Hey, what else would you expect from a Janet Evanovich heroine? <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Evanovich's motorcycle-riding daughter Alex</b> has created an online comic about her hamster called "Batster," which her mother proudly displays on her web site. With episodes like "Batster vs. Beerzilla," it's clear that wackiness runs in the Evanovich genes.  <p>  <b>If you think the Stephanie Plum novels are zany, </b> wait till you hear about what Evanovich was writing before she started getting published. As she explains on her web site, "The first story [I ever wrote] was about the pornographic adventures of a fairy who lived in a second rate fairy forest in Pennsylvania."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2003, Evanovich took some time out to talk with us about her favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>  When I was a kid I read comics. My favorites were <I>Donald Duck</I> and <I>Uncle Scrooge</I>. Donald, Scrooge, Huey, Dewey, and Louie were a little dysfunctional, but they basically liked each other and they were always going on adventures -- just like Stephanie Plum. <p>     <b>What are your all-time favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li>All of the <I>Uncle Scrooge</I> stories by Don Rosa. <p>  <li><I>The Law is a Lady</I> by Nora Roberts, because it encouraged me to try writing romance. <p>  <li><I>The Rake</I> by Mary Jo Putney, because I love the hero to heroine dynamic. <p>  <li>All of Robert Parker's books, because they're so clean. <p>   <li>The <I>Black Stallion</I> series by Walter Farley, because they made my childhood bearable. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you? </b><br>  I like films that make me happy and raise my energy level. I love <I>Ghostbusters</I>, <I>French Kiss</I>, <I>Captain Ron</I>, <I>Troop Beverley Hills</I>, <I>Pretty Woman</I>, <I>Notting Hill</I>, <I>Miss Congeniality</I>, <I>Wallace & Gromit</I>, <I>My Man Godfrey</I>, all Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies, <I>You've Got Mail</I>, <I>Back to School</I>, <I>The Blues Brothers</I>. <p>     <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I need quiet to write. When I listen to music, I like happy music, like funk and disco. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading -- and why? </b><br>  Junie B. Jones books -- because they're fun, and I like the drawings. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I like nonfiction for gifts. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have a Winnie the Pooh clock, a statue of an angry Donald Duck, a Little Lulu bank, a stuffed Sully from <I>Monsters Inc.</I>, a Bartman action figure and my cat, Gus, on my desk when I write. <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I was unpublished for ten years and have three books that are still in my dresser drawer (and will stay there)! If you want something bad enough, you stick with it, eh? <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Don't give up, continue to grow, eat some Cheez Doodles and drink some beer.<p>    <b>What was your first job like?</b><br>   My first job was as a mail clerk for the DuPont chemical plant in South Amboy. I used to have to run across a catwalk grate over vats of formaldehyde to get from one side of the plant to the next.   I used to wear short skirts and the men tending the vats would stand under the grate and wait for my run! <p>    <b>How do you like to unwind?</b><br>  I don't unwind!  I just keep going. If I ever unwound I might not get wound again. I have no hobbies. I just work. I'm <I>really</I> boring. I like champagne and greasy pork roll sandwiches, and shopping for shoes. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>The Barnes & Noble Review</b><br>The saying "When it rains, it pours" certainly applies to the love life of Stephanie Plum, the charming protagonist in Janet Evanovich's wildly popular mystery saga featuring the lingerie buyer turned bounty hunter (<i>Twelve Sharp, Eleven On Top,</i> et al.). In <i>Plum Lovin'</i> -- a "between-the-numbers" mini-escapade -- Plum's love triangle (which includes Trenton cop Joseph Morelli and bounty hunter Ricardo "Ranger" Manoso) suddenly becomes a quadrilateral when Diesel, a hunky heartthrob who is as mentally unstable as he is mysterious, suddenly shows up in Plum's life. <br><br>

A self-proclaimed Unmentionable (someone with abilities that "go beyond what would be considered normal human limitations"), Diesel is somewhere between a certifiable wack job and a superhero with a bad attitude, but Stephanie couldn't care less about his grasp (or lack thereof) on reality: He has killer dimples and a smile that makes women weak in the knees. And he has Annie Hart, a bail-jumping "relationship expert" who is on Stephanie's most wanted list, in his possession. For Plum to get hold of Hart, however, she must first help out five of Annie's lovelorn clients. So, with Valentine's Day quickly approaching, Plum is forced to play Cupid for a divorced mother of four, a dorky vet, a 35-year-old virgin, a shy butcher, and her sister's boyfriend! <br><br>

Mysterious men have a way of showing up in Stephanie Plum's apartment. When the shadowy Diesel appears, he has a task for Stephanie -- and he's not taking no for an answer.

So they make a deal: He'll help her get Annie if Stephanie plays matchmaker to several of Annie's most difficult clients. But someone wants to find Annie even more than Diesel and Stephanie. Someone with a nasty temper. And someone with "unmentionable" skills. Does Diesel know more that he's saying about Annie Hart? Does Diesel have secrets he's keeping from Stephanie and the two men in her life -- Ranger and Morelli?

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>On a very special St. Patrick's Day, Stephanie Plum's grandmother, Grandma Mazur, sees a rainbow, finds a sack full of money-lots of money-and drags her granddaughter into another wild and wooly adventure. Ex-jockey Snuggy O'Conner, ne Zigmond Kulakowski, likes his former mount Douglas Iron Man III a lot. So when Doug develops a sore leg, and his owner plans to retire him from the stud farm to the glue factory, Snuggy bundles Doug into a horse trailer, drives off with him and hijacks $890,000 from Trenton mobster Lou Delvina's headquarters to finance Doug's vet bill. While Snuggy's giving Delvina's goons the slip, however, Grandma Mazur discovers the money. Convinced she has as much right to the swag as anyone else, she takes charge of it, buys herself a used RV and hires three-foot-tall computer geek Randy Briggs to drive her to Atlantic City, a town that really knows how to treat senior citizens. Lickety-split, Stephanie (Lean Mean Thirteen, 2007, etc.) and her no-nonsense colleague Diesel catch up with her grandma. So do Delvina and his troops, who take charge of both Grandma Mazur and Doug-you can't have too many hostages-and set the stage for a hundred more swaps, quips and pratfalls. The plot, much of it echoing the equally preposterous Motor Mouth (2006), is as familiar as the characters. But nobody reads Evanovich for plots or characters, and the frantic, anything-for-a-laugh jokes are brand new and nonstop.

Some fit better than others. And sometimes you go out shopping and there&#8217;s nothing you like. And then, as luck would have it, the next week you find two that are perfect, but you don&#8217;t have the money to buy both. I was currently in just such a position . . . not with shoes, but with men. And this morning it got worse.&nbsp;A while ago, a guy named Diesel showed up in my kitchen. Poof, he was there. Like magic. And then days later, poof, he was gone. Now, without warning, he was once again standing in front of me.&nbsp;&#8220;Surprise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m back.&#8221;&nbsp;He was imposing at just over six feet. Built solid with broad shoulders and deep-set, assessing brown eyes. He looked like he could seriously kick ass and not break a sweat. He had a lot of wavy, sandy blond hair cut short and fierce blond eyebrows. I placed his age at late twenties, early thirties. I knew very little about his background. Clearly he&#8217;d been lucky with the gene pool. He was a nice-looking guy, with perfect white teeth and a smile that made a woman get all warm inside.&nbsp;It was a cold February morning, and he&#8217;d dropped into my apartment wearing a multicolored scarf wrapped around his neck, a black wool peacoat, a washed-out three-button thermal knit shirt, faded jeans, beat-up boots, and his usual bad attitude. I knew that a muscular, athletic body was under the coat. I wasn&#8217;t sure if there was anything good buried under the attitude.&nbsp;My name is Stephanie Plum. I&#8217;m average height and average weight and have an average vocabulary for someone living in Jersey. I have shoulder-length brown hair that is curly orwavy, depending on the humidity. My eyes are blue. My heritage is Hungarian and Italian. My family is dysfunctional in a normal sort of way. There are a bunch of things I&#8217;d like to do with my life, but right now I&#8217;m happy to put one foot in front of the other and button my jeans without having a roll of fat hang over the waistband.&nbsp;I work as a bond enforcement agent for my cousin Vinnie, and my success at the job has more to do with luck and tenacity than with skill. I live in a budget apartment on the outskirts of Trenton, and my only roommate is a hamster named Rex. So I felt understandably threatened by having this big guy suddenly appear in my kitchen.&nbsp;&#8220;I hate when you just show up in front of me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you ring my doorbell like a normal person?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;First off, I&#8217;m not exactly normal. And second, you should be happy I didn&#8217;t walk into your bathroom when you were wet and naked.&#8221; He flashed me the killer smile. &#8220;Although I wouldn&#8217;t have minded finding you wet and naked.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;In your dreams.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Diesel said. &#8220;It&#8217;s happened.&#8221;&nbsp;He stuck his head in my refrigerator and rooted around. Not a lot in there, but he found one last bottle of beer and some slices of American cheese. He ate the cheese and chugged the beer. &#8220;Are you still seeing that cop?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Joe Morelli. Yep.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;What about the guy behind door number two?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Ranger? Yeah, I&#8217;m still working with Ranger.&#8221; Ranger was my bounty hunter mentor and more. Problem was, the more part wasn&#8217;t clearly defined.&nbsp;I heard a snort and a questioning woof from the vicinity of my bedroom.&nbsp;&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Diesel asked.&nbsp;&#8220;Morelli&#8217;s working double shifts, and I&#8217;m taking care of his dog, Bob.&#8221;&nbsp;There was the sound of dog feet running, and Bob rounded a corner and slid to a stop on the kitchen linoleum. He was a big-footed, shaggy, orange-haired beast with floppy ears and happy brown eyes. Probably golden retriever, but he&#8217;d never win best of breed. He sat his ass down on Diesel&#8217;s boot and wagged his tail at him.&nbsp;Diesel absently fondled Bob&#8217;s head, and Bob drooled a little on Diesel&#8217;s pant leg, hoping for a scrap of cheese.&nbsp;&#8220;Is this visit social or professional?&#8221; I asked Diesel.&nbsp;&#8220;Professional. I&#8217;m looking for a guy named Bernie Beaner. I need to shut him down.&#8221;&nbsp;If I&#8217;m to believe Diesel, there are people on this planet who have abilities that go beyond what would be considered normal human limitations. These people aren&#8217;t exactly superheroes. It&#8217;s more that they&#8217;re ordinary souls with the freakish ability to levitate a cow or slow-pitch a lightning bolt. Some are good and some are bad. Diesel tracks the bad. The alternative explanation for Diesel is that he&#8217;s a wacko.&nbsp;&#8220;What&#8217;s Beaner&#8217;s problem?&#8221; I asked.&nbsp;Diesel dropped a small leftover chunk of cheese into Rex&#8217;s cage and gave another chunk to Bob. &#8220;Gone off the edge. His marriage went into the shitter, and he blamed it on another Unmentionable. Now he&#8217;s out to get her.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Unmentionable?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;That&#8217;s what we call ourselves. It sounds better than freak of nature.&#8221;&nbsp;Only marginally.&nbsp;Bob was pushing against Diesel, trying to get him to give up more cheese. Bob was about ninety pounds of rangy dog, and Diesel was two hundred of hard muscle. It would take a lot more than Bob to bulldoze Diesel around my kitchen.&nbsp;&#8220;And you&#8217;re in my apartment, why?&#8221; I asked Diesel.&nbsp;&#8220;I need help.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;No. No, no, no, no, no.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;You have no choice, sweetie pie. The woman Beaner&#8217;s looking for is on your most-wanted list. And she&#8217;s in my custody. If you want your big-ticket bond, you have to help me.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;That&#8217;s horrible. That&#8217;s blackmail or bribery or something.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah. Deal with it.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Who&#8217;s the woman?&#8221; I asked Diesel.&nbsp;&#8220;Annie Hart.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;You&#8217;ve gotta be kidding. Vinnie&#8217;s on a rant over her. I spent all day yesterday looking for her. She&#8217;s wanted for armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s all bogus . . . not that either of us gives a rat&#8217;s ass.&#8221; Diesel was systematically going through my cupboards looking for food, and Bob was sticking close. &#8220;Anyway, bottom line is I&#8217;ve got her tucked away until I can sort things out with crazy Bernie.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Bernie is the . . . um, Unmentionable who&#8217;s after Annie?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah. Problem is, Annie&#8217;s one of those crusader types. Takes her job real serious. Says it&#8217;s her calling. So, the only way I could get Annie to stay hidden was to promise her I&#8217;d take over her caseload. I suck at the kind of stuff she does, so I&#8217;m passing it off to you.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;And what do I get out of this?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;You get Annie. As soon as I take care of Bernie, I&#8217;ll turn Annie over to you.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see where this is a big favor to me. If I don&#8217;t help you, Annie will come out of hiding, I&#8217;ll snag her, and my job will be done.&#8221;&nbsp;Diesel had his thumbs hooked into his jeans pockets; his eyes were locked onto mine, his expression was serious. &#8220;What&#8217;ll it take? I need help with this, and everyone has a price. What&#8217;s yours? How about twenty bucks when you close a case?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;A hundred, and nothing illegal or life-threatening.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Deal,&#8221; Diesel said.&nbsp;Here&#8217;s the sad truth, I had nothing better to do. And I needed money. The bonds office was beyond slow. I had one FTA to hunt down, and Diesel had her locked away.&nbsp;&#8220;Just exactly what am I supposed to do?&#8221; I asked him. &#8220;Annie&#8217;s bond agreement lists her occupation as a relationship expert.&#8221;&nbsp;Diesel gave a bark of laughter. &#8220;Relationship expert. I guess that could cover it.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I don&#8217;t even know what that means! What the heck is a relationship expert?&#8221;&nbsp;Diesel had dropped a battered leather knapsack onto my counter when he popped into my kitchen. He went to the knapsack, removed a large yellow envelope, and handed it over to me. &#8220;It&#8217;s all in this envelope.&#8221;&nbsp;I opened the envelope and pulled out a bunch of folders crammed with photographs and handwritten pages.&nbsp;&#8220;She&#8217;s got a condensed version for you clipped to the top folder,&#8221; Diesel said. &#8220;Got everything prioritized. Says you better hustle because Valentine&#8217;s Day is coming up fast.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;And?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Personally, I don&#8217;t get turned on by Valentine&#8217;s Day, with the sappy cards and creepy cupids and the hearts-and-flowers routine. But Annie is to Valentine&#8217;s Day what Santa Claus is to Christmas. She makes it happen. Of course, Annie operates on a smaller scale. It&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s got ten thousand elves working for her.&#8221;&nbsp;Diesel was a really sexy-looking guy, but I thought he might be one step away from permanent residence at the funny farm. &#8220;I still don&#8217;t get my role in this.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I just handed you five open files. It&#8217;s up to you to make sure those five people have a good Valentine&#8217;s Day.&#8221;&nbsp;Oh boy.&nbsp;&#8220;Listen, I know it&#8217;s lame,&#8221; Diesel said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m stuck with it. And now you&#8217;re stuck with it. And I&#8217;m going to have a power shortage if I don&#8217;t get breakfast. So find me a diner. Then I&#8217;m going to do my thing and look for Bernie, and you&#8217;re going to do your thing and work your way down Annie&#8217;s list.&#8221;&nbsp;I clipped a leash onto Bob&#8217;s collar and the three of us walked down the stairs and out to my car. I was driving a yellow Ford Escape that was good for hauling felons and Bob dogs.&nbsp;&#8220;Does Bob go everywhere?&#8221; Diesel wanted to know.&nbsp;&#8220;Pretty much. If I leave him at home, he gets lonely and eats the furniture.&#8221;&nbsp;Forty minutes later, Diesel was finishing up a mountain of scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, home fries, and sourdough toast with jam . . . all smothered in maple syrup.&nbsp;I&#8217;d ordered a similar breakfast but had to give up about a third of the way through. I pushed my plate away and asked that the food be put in a to-go box. I drank my coffee and thumbed through the first file. Charlene Klinger. Age forty-two. Divorced. Four children, ages seven, eight, ten, and twelve. Worked for the DMV. There was an unflattering snapshot of her squinting into the sun. She was wearing sneakers and slacks and a sweater than didn&#8217;t do a lot to hide the fact that she was about twenty pounds overweight. Her face was pleasant enough. No makeup. Not a lot of hairstyle going on. Short brown hair pushed behind her ears. The smile looked tense, like she was making an effort, but she had bigger fish to fry than to pose for the picture.&nbsp;There were four more pages in Charlene&#8217;s file. Harvey Nolen, Brian Seabeam, Lonnie Brownowski, Steven Klein. reject had been written in red magic marker across each page. A sticky note had been attached to the back of the file. there&#8217;s someone for everyone, the note read. I supposed this was Annie giving herself a pep talk. And a second sticky note below the first. find charlene&#8217;s true love. A mission statement.&nbsp;I blew out a sigh and closed the file.&nbsp;&#8220;Hey, it could be worse,&#8221; Diesel said. &#8220;You could be hunting down a skip who thinks it&#8217;s open season on bounty hunters. Unless you really piss her off, Charlene probably won&#8217;t shoot at you.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where to begin.&#8221;&nbsp;Diesel stood and threw some money on the table. &#8220;You&#8217;ll figure it out. I&#8217;ll check in with you later.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I said. &#8220;About Annie Hart&#8212;&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Later,&#8221; Diesel said. And in three strides he was across the room and at the door. By the time I got to the lot, Diesel was nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, he hadn&#8217;t commandeered my car. It was still in its parking space, Bob looking at me through the back window, somehow understanding that the Styrofoam box in my hand contained food for him.&nbsp;The bail bonds office is a small storefront affair on Hamilton Avenue, just a ten-minute drive from the diner. I parked at the curb and pushed my way through the front door. Connie Rosolli, the office manager, looked up when I entered. Connie is a couple years older than me, a couple pounds heavier, a couple inches shorter, a lot more Italian, and consistently has a better manicure.&nbsp;&#8220;You must be tuned in to the cosmic loop this morning,&#8221; Connie said. &#8220;I was just about to call you. Vinnie&#8217;s bananas over Annie Hart.&#8221;&nbsp;Vinnie&#8217;s ferret face appeared in the doorway of his inner office. &#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked me.&nbsp;&#8220;Well what?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Tell me you&#8217;ve got her locked up nice and neat. Tell me you&#8217;ve got a body receipt.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lead,&#8221; I told Vinnie.&nbsp;&#8220;Only a lead?&#8221; Vinnie clapped his hands to his head. &#8220;You&#8217;re killing me!&#8221;&nbsp;Lula was on the faux leather couch, reading a magazine. &#8220;We should be so lucky,&#8221; Lula said.&nbsp;Lula is a 180-pound black woman crammed into a five-foot, five-inch body. At the moment, she was wearing a red skin-tight spandex T-shirt that said kiss my ass in iridescent gold lettering, jeans with rhinestones marching down side seams that looked like they might burst apart at any minute, and four-inch high-heeled boots. Lula does the office filing when she&#8217;s in the mood, and she rides shotgun for me when I need backup.&nbsp;&#8220;What&#8217;s the lineup look like?&#8221; I asked Connie.&nbsp;&#8220;Nothing new. Annie Hart is the only big bond in the wind. It&#8217;s always slow at this time of the year. All the serious crackheads killed themselves over Christmas, and it&#8217;s too cold for the hookers and pushers to stand on the street corners. The only good crime we&#8217;ve got going on is gang shooting, and those idiots get held without bond.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s so slow Vinnie&#8217;s going on a cruise,&#8221; Lula said.&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, and the cruise isn&#8217;t cheap,&#8221; Vinnie said. &#8220;So get your ass out there and find Annie Hart. I&#8217;m not running a goddamn charity here. I take a hit on Hart&#8217;s bond, and I&#8217;ll have to fake a stroke and cash in my cruise insurance. And Lucille wouldn&#8217;t like that.&#8221;&nbsp;Lucille is Vinnie&#8217;s wife. Her father is Harry the Hammer, and while Harry might understand about the need for the occasional illicit nooner, he definitely wouldn&#8217;t be happy to see Lucille get stiffed on the cruise.&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s one of them champagne Valentine&#8217;s Day cruises,&#8221; Vinnie said. &#8220;Lucille&#8217;s got her bags packed already. She thinks this is going to rejuvenate our marriage.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Only way it&#8217;ll rejuvenate your marriage is if Lucille brings handcuffs and a whip and Mary&#8217;s little lamb,&#8221; Lula said.&nbsp;&#8220;So sue me,&#8221; Vinnie said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got eclectic tastes.&#8221;&nbsp;We all did a lot of eye rolling.&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m out of here,&#8221; I told Connie. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be on my cell if you need me.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m going with you,&#8221; Lula said, grabbing her Prada knockoff shoulder bag. &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling lucky today. I bet I could find Annie Hart right off.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; I said to Lula, &#8220;but I can handle it.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;The hell,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;Suppose you gotta go into some cranky neighborhood, and you need some muscle. That would be me. Or suppose you need to make a doughnut choice at that new place on State Street. That would be me, too.&#8221;&nbsp;I cut my eyes to Lula. &#8220;So what you&#8217;re saying is that you want to test-drive the new doughnut shop on State?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;But only if you need a doughnut real bad.&#8221;&nbsp;Fifteen minutes later, I cruised away from Donut Delish and headed for the DMV.&nbsp;&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re not eating any of these doughnuts,&#8221; Lula said, a bag of doughnuts resting on her lap. &#8220;These are first class. Look at this one with the pink and yellow sprinkles on it. It&#8217;s just about the happiest doughnut I ever saw.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I had a huge late breakfast. I&#8217;m stuffed.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, but we&#8217;re talking about primo doughnuts here.&#8221;&nbsp;Bob was in the cargo area of the Escape. His head was over the backseat, and he was panting in our direction.&nbsp;&#8220;That dog could use a breath mint,&#8221; Lula said.&nbsp;&#8220;Try a doughnut.&#8221;&nbsp;Lula flipped Bob a doughnut. Bob caught the doughnut midair and settled down to enjoy it.&nbsp;&#8220;Where the heck are we going?&#8221; Lula wanted to know. &#8220;I thought we were going after Annie Hart. Don&#8217;t she live in North Trenton?&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s complicated. I had to make a deal. Annie Hart is inaccessible until I wrap up her caseload.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Are you shitting me? And what&#8217;s that mean anyways? Does that mean you&#8217;re taking on her customers? Personally, I can&#8217;t see you doing that. I read her file. She said she was a relationship expert, and I figured that&#8217;s code for &#8217;ho.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that. It&#8217;s more like matchmaking. First person on my list is Charlene Klinger. She&#8217;s forty-two and divorced, and we need to find her true love.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;Oh boy, true love. That&#8217;s a bitch. You sure she wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied if we just found her some nasty sweaty sex? I got a couple names in my book for that one.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure it has to be true love.&#8221;&nbsp;Copyright &#169; 2007 by Evanovich, Inc.

Some fit better than others. And sometimes you   go out shopping and there's nothing you like. And then, as luck   would have it, the next week you find two that are perfect, but you   don't have the money to buy both. I was currently in just such a   position ... not with shoes, but with men. And this morning it got   worse.<br>A while ago, a guy named Diesel showed up in my kitchen. Poof, he   was there. Like magic. And then days later, poof, he was gone. Now,   without warning, he was once again standing in front of me.<br>"Surprise," he said. "I'm back."<br>He was imposing at just over six feet. Built solid with broad   shoulders and deep-set, assessing brown eyes. He looked like he   could seriously kick ass and not break a sweat. He had a lot of   wavy, sandy blond hair cut short and fierce blond eyebrows. I placed   his age at late twenties, early thirties. I knew very little about   his background. Clearly he'd been lucky with the gene pool. He was a   nice-looking guy, with perfect white teeth and a smile that made a   woman get all warm inside.<br>It was a cold February morning, and he'd dropped into my apartment   wearing a multicolored scarf wrapped around his neck, a black wool   peacoat, a washed-out three-button thermal knit shirt, faded jeans,   beat-up boots, and his usual bad attitude. I knew that a muscular,   athletic body was under the coat. I wasn't sure if there was   anything good buried under the attitude.<br>My name is Stephanie Plum. I'm average height and average weight and   have an average vocabulary for someone living in Jersey. I have   shoulder-length brown hair that is curly or wavy, depending on the   humidity. My eyes are blue. My heritage is Hungarian and Italian. My   family is dysfunctional in a normal sort of way. There are a bunch   of things I'd like to do with my life, but right now I'm happy to   put one foot in front of the other and button my jeans without   having a roll of fat hang over the waistband.<br>I work as a bond enforcement agent for my cousin Vinnie, and my   success at the job has more to do with luck and tenacity than with   skill. I live in a budget apartment on the outskirts of Trenton, and   my only roommate is a hamster named Rex. So I felt understandably   threatened by having this big guy suddenly appear in my kitchen.<br>"I hate when you just show up in front of me," I said. "Can't you   ring my doorbell like a normal person?"<br>"First off, I'm not exactly normal. And second, you should be happy   I didn't walk into your bathroom when you were wet and naked." He   flashed me the killer smile. "Although I wouldn't have minded   finding you wet and naked."<br>"In your dreams."<br>"Yeah," Diesel said. "It's happened."<br>He stuck his head in my refrigerator and rooted around. Not a lot in   there, but he found one last bottle of beer and some slices of   American cheese. He ate the cheese and chugged the beer. "Are you   still seeing that cop?"<br>"Joe Morelli. Yep."<br>"What about the guy behind door number two?"<br>"Ranger? Yeah, I'm still working with Ranger." Ranger was my bounty   hunter mentor and more. Problem was, the more part wasn't clearly   defined.<br>I heard a snort and a questioning woof from the vicinity of my   bedroom.<br>"What's that?" Diesel asked.<br>"Morelli's working double shifts, and I'm taking care of his dog, Bob."<br>There was the sound of dog feet running, and Bob rounded a corner   and slid to a stop on the kitchen linoleum. He was a big-footed,   shaggy, orange-haired beast with floppy ears and happy brown eyes.   Probably golden retriever, but he'd never win best of breed. He sat   his ass down on Diesel's boot and wagged his tail at him.<br>Diesel absently fondled Bob's head, and Bob drooled a little on   Diesel's pant leg, hoping for a scrap of cheese.<br>"Is this visit social or professional?" I asked Diesel.<br>"Professional. I'm looking for a guy named Bernie Beaner. I need to   shut him down."<br>If I'm to believe Diesel, there are people on this planet who have   abilities that go beyond what would be considered normal human   limitations. These people aren't exactly superheroes. It's more that   they're ordinary souls with the freakish ability to levitate a cow   or slow-pitch a lightning bolt. Some are good and some are bad.   Diesel tracks the bad. The alternative explanation for Diesel is   that he's a wacko.<br>"What's Beaner's problem?" I asked.<br>Diesel dropped a small leftover chunk of cheese into Rex's cage and   gave another chunk to Bob. "Gone off the edge. His marriage went   into the shitter, and he blamed it on another Unmentionable. Now   he's out to get her."<br>"Unmentionable?"<br>"That's what we call ourselves. It sounds better than freak of   nature."<br>Only marginally.<br>Bob was pushing against Diesel, trying to get him to give up more   cheese. Bob was about ninety pounds of rangy dog, and Diesel was two   hundred of hard muscle. It would take a lot more than Bob to   bulldoze Diesel around my kitchen.<br>"And you're in my apartment, why?" I asked Diesel.<br>"I need help."<br>"No. No, no, no, no, no."<br>"You have no choice, sweetie pie. The woman Beaner's looking for is   on your most-wanted list. And she's in my custody. If you want your   big-ticket bond, you have to help me."<br>"That's horrible. That's blackmail or bribery or something."<br>"Yeah. Deal with it."<br>"Who's the woman?" I asked Diesel.<br>"Annie Hart."<br>"You've gotta be kidding. Vinnie's on a rant over her. I spent all   day yesterday looking for her. She's wanted for armed robbery and   assault with a deadly weapon."<br>"It's all bogus ... not that either of us gives a rat's ass."   Diesel was systematically going through my cupboards looking for   food, and Bob was sticking close. "Anyway, bottom line is I've got   her tucked away until I can sort things out with crazy Bernie."<br>"Bernie is the ... um, Unmentionable who's after Annie?"<br>"Yeah. Problem is, Annie's one of those crusader types. Takes her   job real serious. Says it's her calling. So, the only way I could   get Annie to stay hidden was to promise her I'd take over her   caseload. I suck at the kind of stuff she does, so I'm passing it   off to you."<br>"And what do I get out of this?"<br>"You get Annie. As soon as I take care of Bernie, I'll turn Annie   over to you."<br>"I don't see where this is a big favor to me. If I don't help you,   Annie will come out of hiding, I'll snag her, and my job will be   done."<br>Diesel had his thumbs hooked into his jeans pockets; his eyes were   locked onto mine, his expression was serious. "What'll it take? I   need help with this, and everyone has a price. What's yours? How   about twenty bucks when you close a case?"<br>"A hundred, and nothing illegal or life-threatening."<br>"Deal," Diesel said.<br>Here's the sad truth, I had nothing better to do. And I needed   money. The bonds office was beyond slow. I had one FTA to hunt down,   and Diesel had her locked away.<br>"Just exactly what am I supposed to do?" I asked him. "Annie's bond   agreement lists her occupation as a relationship expert."<br>Diesel gave a bark of laughter. "Relationship expert. I guess that   could cover it."<br>"I don't even know what that means! What the heck is a relationship   expert?"<br>Diesel had dropped a battered leather knapsack onto my counter when   he popped into my kitchen. He went to the knapsack, removed a large   yellow envelope, and handed it over to me. "It's all in this   envelope."<br>I opened the envelope and pulled out a bunch of folders crammed with   photographs and handwritten pages.<br>"She's got a condensed version for you clipped to the top folder,"   Diesel said. "Got everything prioritized. Says you better hustle   because Valentine's Day is coming up fast."<br>"And?"<br>"Personally, I don't get turned on by Valentine's Day, with the   sappy cards and creepy cupids and the hearts-and-flowers routine.   But Annie is to Valentine's Day what Santa Claus is to Christmas.   She makes it happen. Of course, Annie operates on a smaller scale.   It's not like she's got ten thousand elves working for her."<br>Diesel was a really sexy-looking guy, but I thought he might be one   step away from permanent residence at the funny farm. "I still don't   get my role in this."<br>"I just handed you five open files. It's up to you to make sure   those five people have a good Valentine's Day."<br>Oh boy.<br>"Listen, I know it's lame," Diesel said, "but I'm stuck with it. And   now you're stuck with it. And I'm going to have a power shortage if   I don't get breakfast. So find me a diner. Then I'm going to do my   thing and look for Bernie, and you're going to do your thing and   work your way down Annie's list."<br>I clipped a leash onto Bob's collar and the three of us walked down   the stairs and out to my car. I was driving a yellow Ford Escape   that was good for hauling felons and Bob dogs.<br>"Does Bob go everywhere?" Diesel wanted to know.<br>"Pretty much. If I leave him at home, he gets lonely and eats the   furniture."<br>Forty minutes later, Diesel was finishing up a mountain of scrambled   eggs, bacon, pancakes, home fries, and sourdough toast with jam ... all  smothered in maple syrup.<br>I'd ordered a similar breakfast but had to give up about a third of   the way through. I pushed my plate away and asked that the food be   put in a to-go box. I drank my coffee and thumbed through the first   file. Charlene Klinger. Age forty-two. Divorced. Four children, ages   seven, eight, ten, and twelve. Worked for the DMV. There was an   unflattering snapshot of her squinting into the sun. She was wearing   sneakers and slacks and a sweater than didn't do a lot to hide the   fact that she was about twenty pounds overweight. Her face was   pleasant enough. No makeup. Not a lot of hairstyle going on. Short   brown hair pushed behind her ears. The smile looked tense, like she   was making an effort, but she had bigger fish to fry than to pose   for the picture.<br>There were four more pages in Charlene's file. Harvey Nolen, Brian   Seabeam, Lonnie Brownowski, Steven Klein, reject had been written in   red magic marker across each page. A sticky note had been attached   to the back of the file. There's someone for everyone, the note   read. I supposed this was Annie giving herself a pep talk. And a   second sticky note below the first. Find charlene's true love. A   mission statement.<br>I blew out a sigh and closed the file.<br>"Hey, it could be worse," Diesel said. "You could be hunting down a   skip who thinks it's open season on bounty hunters. Unless you   really piss her off, Charlene probably won't shoot at you."<br>"I don't know where to begin."<br>Diesel stood and threw some money on the table. "You'll figure it   out. I'll check in with you later."<br>"Wait," I said. "About Annie Hart-"<br>"Later," Diesel said. And in three strides he was across the room   and at the door. By the time I got to the lot, Diesel was nowhere to   be seen. Fortunately, he hadn't commandeered my car. It was still in   its parking space, Bob looking at me through the back window,   somehow understanding that the Styrofoam box in my hand contained   food for him.<br>The bail bonds office is a small storefront affair on Hamilton   Avenue, just a ten-minute drive from the diner. I parked at the curb   and pushed my way through the front door. Connie Rosolli, the office   manager, looked up when I entered. Connie is a couple years older   than me, a couple pounds heavier, a couple inches shorter, a lot   more Italian, and consistently has a better manicure.<br>"You must be tuned in to the cosmic loop this morning," Connie said.   "I was just about to call you. Vinnie's bananas over Annie Hart."<br>Vinnie's ferret face appeared in the doorway of his inner office.   "Well?" he asked me.<br>"Well what?"<br>"Tell me you've got her locked up nice and neat. Tell me you've got  a body receipt."<br>"I've got a lead," I told Vinnie.<br>"Only a lead?" Vinnie clapped his hands to his head. "You're killing   me!"<br>Lula was on the faux leather couch, reading a magazine. "We should   be so lucky," Lula said.<br>Lula is a 180-pound black woman crammed into a five-foot, five-inch   body. At the moment, she was wearing a red skin-tight spandex   T-shirt that said kiss my ass in iridescent gold lettering, jeans   with rhinestones marching down side seams that looked like they   might burst apart at any minute, and four-inch high-heeled boots.
