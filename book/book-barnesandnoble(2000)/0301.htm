											This book peaks your interest from the dust jacket and inside cover with the many, many pictures of people, which turn out to be subjects of John's research, all the way through the end of the book.  <p/><p/>John offers valuable insights to becoming better communicators as well as better listeners.  No matter who you are and who your audience is, you can communicate with them.  It takes practice...it will not happen overnight, but you can acquire the skills necessary to reach your family as well as those in business or friends or church or even a stranger on the street.  This communication will improve relationships vastly and your life will become more successful and enjoyable.  <p/><p/>The book is easy to read; the principles for communication are given and clearly stated.  You can't help but learn from a renown leadership expert like John Maxwell. Just take the time to read the book.  <p/><p/>Disclosure statement: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

											This book, while full of useful advice, does not read like your typical self-help, business literature.  John Maxwell has proved again why he is such a well respected and world-renown leadership expert.  He writes in such a manner that you cannot help but learn from his teachings. His methods are not in your face but rather subtly absorbed.  The book is full of one-person anecdotes that many of his readers can relate to.  His suggestions, while not specific, open your mind to possibilities in communication and encourage you to explore your connections with people.  I really enjoyed reading the book.  With communication and information overload in today's society, his anecdotes are relevant for business or casual relationships, face-to-face, internet, telephone or written contacts.  I found it a refreshing change from many of the business and communication books I have read in the past.  It is an easy read and a book I will turn to again from time to time.  Recommended for those who like reflect and then improve their relationships - business and personal - but are not looking for a step-by-step how-to manual.  A good choice for book clubs with an emphasis on business.  <p/><p/><p/>Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their BookSneeze.com &amp;lt;http://BookSneeze.com&amp;gt; book review bloggers program.

Everywhere we go, everywhere  we look, someone is trying to get our attention. Every politician,  advertiser, journalist, family member, and acquaintance has something  to say to us. Every day we are faced with e-mails, text messages,  billboards, television, movies, radio, Twitter, Facebook, and blogs.  Add to these newspapers, magazines, and books. Our world is cluttered  with words. How do we choose which messages to tune in and  which ones to tune out?  <p>     At the same time, we also have messages we want to get across  to others. I've read that, on average, most people speak about sixteen  thousand words a day. If you transcribed those words, they'd  fill a three-hundred-page book every week. At the end of a year,  you would have an entire bookcase full of words. In a lifetime,  you'd fill a library. But how many of your words would matter? How  many would make a difference? How many would get through to  others?  <p>     Talk is easy. Everybody talks. The question is, how can you make  your words count?  <p>     How can you <i>really</i> communicate with others?  <p>  <p>                              Connecting Can                          Make You or Break You  <p>  People cannot succeed in life without communicating effectively.  It's not enough just to work hard. It's not enough to do a great job.  To be successful, you need to learn how to  really communicate with others.  <p>     Have you ever gotten frustrated while  making a presentation because people  just weren't getting it? Have you ever  wanted your boss to understand how  much value you add to the company so  you could get a well-earned raise or promotion?  If you have children, have you  wanted them to listen so you could help  them make good choices? Have you  wanted to improve your relationship with  a friend or make a positive impact on your community? If you can't  find a way to communicate effectively, you won't be able to reach  your potential, you won't succeed in the way you desire, and you'll  be forever frustrated.  <p>     What's the secret? Connecting! After more than forty years of  marriage, a long and successful career as a public speaker, decades  of leading various organizations, and experience in helping people  develop across the United States and in dozens of countries around  the world, I can tell you this&#58; if you want to succeed, you must learn  how to connect with others.  <p>  <p>                             Connecting Is Key  <p>  I am convinced more than ever that good communication and leadership  are all about connecting. If you can connect with others at  every level-one-on-one, in groups, and with an audience-your  relationships are stronger, your sense of community improves, your  ability to create teamwork increases, your influence increases, and  your productivity skyrockets.  <p>     What do I mean when I say "connect"? Connecting is the ability  to identify with people and relate to them in a way that increases your  influence with them. Why is that important?  Because the ability to communicate  and connect with others is a major determining  factor in reaching your potential.  To be successful, you must work with others.  And to do that at your absolute best,  you must learn to connect.  <p>     How much healthier would your relationships  be if you excelled at connecting?  How would your marriage and family life improve? How much  happier would your relationships with friends be? How much better  would you be at getting along with your neighbors if you were able  to connect with them?  <p>     How would being a better connector impact your career? What  would happen if you were fantastic at connecting with your coworkers?  How would things change at work if you were better able to connect  with your boss? According to the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, "The number  one criteria for advancement and promotion for professionals is  an ability to communicate effectively." That means connecting! If  you learned to connect better, it would change your life!  <p>  <p>                      Connecting Is Crucial for Leaders  <p>  I am probably best known for my writing and speaking on leading. If  you want to become more productive and influential, learn to  become a better leader because everything  rises and falls on leadership. And the best  leaders are always excellent connectors.  <p>     If you're interested in a case study in  connecting in the context of leadership, all  you have to do is look at the presidents of  the United States from the last thirty years.  Because every move of those presidents is  documented in the press at home and  around the world, most people are familiar  with them.  <p>     Presidential historian Robert Dallek  says that successful presidents exhibit five  qualities that enable them to achieve  things that others don't&#58; vision, pragmatism,  consensus building, charisma, and trustworthiness. As leadership  and communication consultant John Baldoni points out,  <p>     Four of these factors depend heavily upon the ability to communicate     on multiple levels. Presidents, like all leaders, need     to be able to describe where they are going (vision), persuade     people to come along with them (consensus), connect     on a personal level (charisma), and demonstrate credibility,     i.e., do what they say they will do (trust). Even pragmatism     depends on communications ... So in a very real sense, leadership     effectiveness, both for presidents and for anyone else     in a position of authority, depends to a high degree upon     good communication skills.  <p>  <p>     And what do those communication skills depend on?  Connecting!  <p>     Set aside your political opinions and biases for a moment and  look at the abilities of some past presidents. Consider the differences  in connecting skill between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter  when they ran against one another. In their final debate on October  28, 1980, Carter came across as cold and impersonal. To every question  he was asked, Carter responded with facts and figures. Walter  Cronkite described Carter as humorless. Dan Rather called Carter  stoic and disengaged. And as Carter made a case to be reelected, he  seemed to bounce back and forth between trying to impress people  by stating cold facts and trying to make his listeners feel sympathy  for him and the burden of his job. At one point he stated, "I alone  have had to determine the interest of my country and the involvement  of my country," and he stated, "It's a lonely job." He never  focused on his audience and their concerns.  <p>     In contrast, Reagan was engaged with his audience and even  with Carter. Before the debate, Reagan walked over to Carter to  shake his hand, which seemed to startle the president. During the  debate, when his opponent spoke, Reagan listened and smiled.  When it was Reagan's turn to speak, his appeals were often directed  to his audience. He wasn't trying to come across as an expert,  though he did quote figures and dispute some of Carter's facts. He  was trying to connect. Many remember his closing remarks, in which  he asked people, "Are you better off than you were four years ago?"  Reagan told his audience, "You made this country great." His focus  was on the people. There couldn't have been a greater contrast  between the Great Communicator and his predecessor.  <p>     A similar contrast can be seen between Bill Clinton and his successor,  George W. Bush. Clinton took communication to the next  level as president. He equaled Reagan's ability to connect one-on-one  as well as on camera. When he said, "I feel your pain," most  people around the country connected with him. Clinton not only  possessed Reagan's connection skills but also added to them a mastery  of the interview and talk show formats, which was critical when  he ran for election. He seemed never to miss an opportunity to try  to connect. So far, no politician has surpassed him in connecting  with others.  <p>     Bush, on the other hand, seemed to miss nearly <i>every</i> opportunity  to connect with people. His one clear moment of connection  occurred immediately after September 11, 2001, when he spoke at  Ground Zero. After that he usually fumbled and flopped when he  tried to speak with others. His inability to connect alienated people  and colored everything he did as president.  <p>     Communication expert Bert Decker publishes a list every year of  the top ten best and worst communicators of the year. Guess who  was on the worst communicator list every year during his last term  in office? That's right, President George W. Bush. In 2008, Decker  wrote about Bush, "Soon after [9/11] he slipped back to the shrugs  and smirks, and tangles of syntax and grammar. It perhaps reached  a nadir in the response to Katrina. Such is not the communications  of a leader. Having so little influence this  past year, it is sad to put our president as  the #1 worst communicator of 2008."  <p>     If you follow politics, you probably  have a strong opinion about Jimmy Carter,  Ronald Regan, Bill Clinton, and George  W. Bush. You can say what you will-either  positive or negative-about their character,  philosophy, or policies. But their effectiveness  as leaders was definitely impacted  by their ability or inability to connect.  <p>     Connecting is crucial whether you're  trying to lead a child or a nation.  President Gerald Ford once remarked,  "If I went back to college again, I'd concentrate  on two areas&#58; learning to write and to speak before an audience.  Nothing in life is more important than the ability to  communicate effectively." Talent isn't enough. Experience isn't  enough. To lead others, you must be able to communicate well, and  connecting is key.  <p>  <p>                Connecting Helps in Every Area of Life  <p>  Of course, connecting isn't just for leaders. It's for anyone who  desires to be more effective at what he or she does or enjoy better  relationships. I received many comments from people on my blog,  JohnMaxwellOnLeadership.com, affirming this.  <p>     I heard from business people such as Tom Martin, who described  the importance of connection in his work. "To connect is to join, but  to make a connection there has to be rapport," wrote Tom. "This is  what I try to help our sales force to see as their role in transitioning  a lead into a prospect, a prospect into a customer, and a customer  into a client. It is those connected clients who become our greatest  advocates to help us grow our business."  <p>     I also heard from many teachers and trainers. Exceed Resources  trainer and coach Cassandra Washington told me, "In the classroom,  I teach that connection is key. Leadership is about connecting  with people. Serving customers is about connecting. Raising  kids ... connecting." An English as a Second Language teacher,  Lindsay Fawcett, wrote that when she was in Hong Kong and mainland  China, she noticed that whenever she went to a meeting, there  was always a connection time planned before it started, with food  and drinks provided so that people could get to know one another.  It changed her perspective. "I am one of those people who grew up  being able to do 'things' well, but I never understood the idea of  connecting. I finally learned to connect with my students, which has  helped me become a better teacher."  <p>     Jennifer Williams, who had just moved into a new neighborhood,  said that she went out of her way to meet new neighbors, talk  to them, discover their occupations, and learn the names of their  children and pets. As she did, people began to come together.  "Wow," one neighbor told her, "until you moved in, we rarely talked,  didn't know each other, and would never sit out in the evenings and  socialize. Here you've been for less than two months, and you know  everyone!" Jennifer says it's because "people want to be made to feel  connected and a part of something." I agree, but I also recognize  that she is a connector!  <p>     When people possess the ability to connect, it makes a huge difference  in what they can accomplish. You don't have to be a president  or high-profile executive for connecting to add value to you.  Connecting is vital for any person who wants to achieve success. It is  essential for anyone who wants to build great relationships. You will  only be able to reach your potential-regardless of your profession  or chosen path-when you learn to connect with other people.  Otherwise, you'll be like a nuclear power plant disconnected from  the grid. You'll have incredible resources and potential, but you will  never be able to put them to use.  <p>  <p>                          The Desire to Connect  <p>  I am convinced that nearly anyone can learn to connect with others.  Why? Because I learned how to do it. Connecting wasn't something  I did naturally. When I was a kid, I wanted to connect with my parents,  not just because I loved them but also because I suspected that  if I had a good connection with my mother, it might keep me from  getting a spanking when I misbehaved.  <p>     I also learned that humor could be very valuable for connecting.  I remember one time when my older brother, Larry, and I got  into trouble and laughter saved me. Usually when we were punished,  we were asked to bend over and grab a chair. Then Mom  would give us a couple of whacks on the seat of our pants with a  pancake spatula. Larry, as the oldest, usually went first, and on this  occasion, when Mom gave him the first whack, there was a loud  <i>bang</i>, and a puff of smoke emerged from Larry's hind end. The  explanation? Larry had a roll of caps stored in his back pocket.  Mom just howled. We all ended up laughing, and best of all, I didn't  get a spanking that day! For three weeks, I kept caps in my back  pockets-just in case.  <p>     As I got a little older and entered school, I became aware that  some kids connected with the teachers while I didn't. In first grade,  Diana Crabtree was the student who connected. In second grade, it  was Elaine Mosley, and in third grade, Jeff Ankrom. I could see that  the teachers loved those kids. I wanted my teachers to like me too,  and I started to wonder what my classmates were doing that I wasn't.  <p>     In junior high school, it was the same thing. When I tried out for  the basketball team, I made the squad, but I didn't get to start, even  though I was a better player than two of the other players who were  starters. I could sense an invisible barrier that was keeping me from  where I wanted to go. I felt frustrated. I wondered why Coach Neff  liked them more than he liked me. What I discovered was that those  students had connected with Coach during the previous year, and I  hadn't. My lack of connection held me back.  <p>     Have you ever experienced similar things? Maybe you are the  most skilled person in an area at work, yet you never get promoted.  Or you work hard and produce, but others don't seem to appreciate  what you do. Or maybe you desire to build relationships with people  around you, but they don't seem to listen to you the way they do to  others. Or you want to create an effective team-or just become part  of a good team-but you are made to feel like an outsider. What's  the problem? It's connection. To succeed with other people, you  need to be able to connect.  <p>     I finally started to learn about connecting in high school. My  wife, Margaret, and I started dating then. She was very popular, and  there were three other young men besides me who were interested  in her. To be honest, she had her doubts about me. I was always trying  to impress her, but she was suspicious whenever I lavished compliments  on her. "Hmph," she'd say. "How can you say that? You  don't even know me that well!"  <p>     How did I stay in the game? I decided to connect with her mother!  Once I won over Margaret's mother, I gained some time to win over  Margaret. And whenever I did something  stupid, which I must admit was too often,  Margaret's mother would defend me. It  helped me to win Margaret's confidence  and, years later, her hand in marriage.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>EVERYONE COMMUNICATES, FEW CONNECT</b> by <b>JOHN C.
