</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Hitler's death did not end the war in Europe in 1945. Instead, as diplomat-historian Stafford (Ten Days to D-Day: Citizens and Soldiers on the Eve of the Invasion, 2004, etc.) writes, the fighting dragged on for three more momentous months, during which Europe was reshaped. That quarter-year has not exactly been overlooked. The closing pages of Stephen E. Ambrose's Band of Brothers, for instance, find its paratrooper protagonists in western Austria, where, as Stafford notes, it was feared that the remnants of the Nazi state would attempt to regroup for a last stand in the mountainous redoubt. That prospect, surmises the author, contributed to Eisenhower's decision not to race to Berlin but instead to stop the Western Allies's advance at the Elbe River and cede the land east of it to the Soviets, even though Churchill was strongly agitating to "capture Berlin and use it as a bargaining tool with the Soviet leader." Even in the desperate days before Hitler's suicide, German soldiers were offering stiff resistance. In its wake, strong German resistance continued until the government of Admiral Doenitz finally agreed to unconditional surrender, having offered to make peace with the West under the condition that Germany be allowed to continue fighting against the Soviet Union. Eisenhower did keep the lines open for two days to allow German units an escape route to the west, and, writes Stafford, "thanks to Doenitz's delaying tactics, almost two million German soldiers were able to avoid Soviet captivity." With that surrender, the Allies now had the task of imposing occupation rule on Germany, quashing any last efforts at armed resistance and cleaning up a horrific mess while attending tomillions of displaced, starving persons-a story that stretches well beyond July 1945, but one that Stafford capably outlines. Drawing on the memoirs of participants-from Nazi test pilots to concentration-camp inmates-and on an impressive body of historical work, Stafford delivers a useful survey of a transformative time.

											The Missing Final Chapter Of World War II<p/>David Stafford<p/>Little, Brown &amp; Co., 2008<p/>ISBN:  9780316035996<p/>Reviewed by Debra Gaynor for ReviewYourBook.com, 2008<p/>5 stars<p/>The Missing Final Chapter Of World War II<p/>Endgame, 1945 by David Stafford is a well-researched account of the last month of World War II.  Stafford concentrates on nine individuals:  soldiers, war correspondents, POWs, men, and women. The text begins with Hitler's birthday, April 20, 1945.  <p/>Endgame, 1945 captured my attention from the first page.  The events came to life as I read of the atrocious events.  David Stafford tells the story through the lives of nine individuals:  Soldiers, such as: Robert Ellis from Wooster, Ohio and Lieutenant Bryan Samian, a young British Commando, and prisoners.  Twenty-six year old Fey von Hassel was an ambassador's daughter imprisoned by the Germans for her father's sentiments.  Then, there were the war correspondents, like Robert Reid.  <p/>This was not a pleasant read.  Stafford's descriptions are so vivid I could see them taking place in my mind's eye.  In one chapter, he tells of a woman, hair covered in lice, protruding ribs, so weak that she could not lift herself off the floor as diarrhea bubbled up across her thighs.  Stafford describes the Concentration Camps.  He includes photographs.  Among the photos are Reg Roy, Robert Ellis, Bryan Samain, Fey von Hassel, and Robert Reid.  While this book is not for the faint of heart, it tells of an event that should never be forgotten.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>To end a history of World War II at VE Day is to leave the tale half told.

Since seizing power in  1933 and making himself F&uuml;hrer of the German people, the anniversary  had been celebrated throughout the Reich as a public holiday. Across  Germany, the blood-red flag of the Nazi Party, with its crooked  black swastika, had festooned private balconies and public buildings  alike. Radio broadcasts had played special music and adulatory  speeches, schoolchildren had enjoyed the day off, and at his  Bavarian home at Obersalzberg outside Berchtesgaden Hitler had  smiled paternally as blonde young girls presented him with posies of  alpine flowers.  <p>  But today, as he turned fifty-six, the mood was distinctly  unfestive. Josef Goebbels, the F&uuml;hrer's fervently loyal minister of  propaganda, tried to make the best of it all amid the mood of  impending disaster. The German people, he announced that morning on  the radio, should trust their leader to the bitter end. For this,  Hitler himself was now making grim preparation. For weeks he had  been in Berlin, living an underground existence in his neon-lit  bunker deep below the Chancellery. It consisted of eighteen cramped  rooms with a special suite that he shared with his mistress, Eva  Braun.  <p>  Today, as elsewhere across Europe, it was a sunny spring day in the  German capital and the lilacs were in bloom. But throughout the city  housewives were desperately stocking up with food in preparation for  the battle that everyone knew was coming. Overhead, the once vaunted  and feared Luftwaffe was reduced to an impotent weapon, and American  and British heavy bombers had been hitting the capital with impunity  for months. Only the week before, they had sent the Foreign Ministry  and the old Reich Chancellery itself up in flames. Now, overnight,  knowing the significance of the date, they had returned for an even  bigger raid, and all day the acrid smell of smoke hung heavy in the  air. On the ground, Red Army forces had begun their final big  offensive against the capital with two and a half million men and  were rapidly approaching the eastern suburbs, threatening to  surround the city completely. The thunder of heavy artillery was now  audible even to those below ground.  <p>  Traditionally, the F&uuml;hrer was congratulated first on his birthday  just after the stroke of midnight by his personal household staff.  But this year he told them the situation was too somber for such  ceremonies. Despite this, they persisted. Looking twenty years older  than his actual age and his skin a deathly white, he trudged down  the line of men and women and limply shook hands with each of them.  Then, after sleeping a few hours, in the early afternoon he climbed  the steps out of the bunker into the Chancellery garden to take Nazi  salutes from selected army units and SS troops. About twenty teenage  boys from the Hitler Youth who had been fighting against the  Russians were also lined up.  <p>  Hitler was wearing his field-gray army uniform jacket with its Iron  Cross, awarded for bravery during the First World War. Slowly, he  walked down the line, pinching a few of the boys on the cheek and  muttering words of encouragement. A newsreel camera recorded the  event. Inadvertently, it also captured the violently shaking left  hand that he kept firmly behind his back in an effort to conceal it,  a mark of his rapid physical decline in recent months. "Here in  Berlin," Hitler told the teenagers, "we are facing the great,  decisive battle ... Our belief that we will win ... has to  remain unbroken. The situation can be compared with that of a  patient believed to have reached the end. Yet he does not have to  die. He can be saved with a new medication, discovered just in time  to save him."  <p>  What the miracle at this stage might be was anyone's guess. Since  the allied landings in France on D-Day the previous June, Hitler and  Goebbels had constantly hinted at miracle weapons that would yet win  the war, such as the V2 rocket or a new jet aircraft. The week  before, it had even seemed that a political rather than a military  miracle might save the Reich. Shortly before midnight on Thursday 12  April a BBC-Reuters flash had announced the sudden death of  President Franklin D. Roosevelt at his private retreat in Warm  Springs, Georgia.  <p>  Goebbels immediately phoned Hitler. "My F&uuml;hrer," he exclaimed, "this  is the miracle of the House of Brandenburg we have been waiting for.  This is the turning point predicted in your horoscope!" The Minister  of Propaganda was referring to a historical event well known to  Hitler, with his megalomaniac habit of comparing himself to the  great figures of German history. In 1762, King Frederick the Great  of Prussia had been saved from defeat in the Seven Years' War  against Russia by the sudden death of Czarina Elizabeth. Hitler, who  kept a portrait of Frederick in his bunker study, reacted to  Goebbels's news with delight. Soon, he told him, the Americans and  the Red Army would be exchanging artillery barrages over the roof of  the Chancellery.  <p>  The euphoria had been fleeting. Few of those now listening to  Hitler's promises in the garden placed much faith in his curiously  defiant yet depressing message to the assembled faithful about a  dying patient. Later that day, below ground again, he greeted  assembled luminaries of the Reich-ministers and generals alike-who  had come to give him their birthday wishes. He shook hands with each  and exchanged a desultory few words. Then, the birthday ritual  completed, they turned to the great decision of the day. Would  Hitler stay in Berlin, or would he move south to Bavaria to lead  some last-ditch resistance from his base at Berchtesgaden? This had  long been the plan. Just ten days before, he had sent his servants  south to prepare the way.  <p>  The decision was now urgent. The Red Army advance was so rapid and  so close that it threatened to cut off all routes of escape out of  the city. Worse, with the Russians advancing west, and the Americans  moving rapidly east in central and southern Germany, the Reich faced  being cut in two, with the route south to Bavaria being completely  shut off. Everyone present argued that Hitler should quit his  capital immediately. Earlier in the day, Field Marshal Wilhelm  Keitel, his military chief, had urged this course, but he had been  rebuffed. "Keitel," said Hitler, "I know what I want. I will fight  on in front of, within, or behind Berlin." Now, after further  discussion, he relented a little by saying that he would leave the  final decision to fate.  <p>  Yet, in truth, he had already made up his mind. In March, Eva Braun  had arrived in Berlin from Berchtesgaden. Then, just a week ago, she  had descended from her private apartment in the Chancellery to sleep  with Hitler in the bunker. Gerda Christian, his senior private  secretary, knew instinctively what this meant&#58; Hitler would never  flee to Bavaria. Instead, Berchtesgaden, in the shape of Eva Braun,  had come to Berlin. Hitler's mistress was a middle-class Catholic  girl from Munich. Twenty-three years his junior, she had met him in  the studios of his official photographer Heinrich Hoffman, where she  was working as an assistant. Whatever else might be said about her,  she was loyalty supreme. She would stay at his side until the bitter  end.  <p>  Gerda Christian's guess was confirmed later that evening when  Hitler, as so often, ended his day by chatting with his secretaries  in his study. He always liked the company of impressionable young  women, and it was to women that he often revealed his deepest  feelings. They too wanted to know if he would leave Berlin. If he  did, he replied, he would feel like a Tibetan lama turning an empty  prayer mill. "I must," he insisted, "bring things to a head in  Berlin-or go under!"  <p>  To all but the willfully blind, it was now obvious he would do both.  Moreover, whatever he said or did in Berlin was increasingly  irrelevant to the march of war throughout his beleaguered Reich and  beyond.  <p>  <p>  Of all the bitter months of the war against Hitler, April 1945 was  the hardest to bear. It was not just the weather, although this  proved true to form, shifting treacherously between days of spring  promise and the last gasps of a dying winter that fought back  tenaciously with sleeting hard rain and flurries of snow that drove  soldiers and civilians alike scurrying for warmth.  <p>  Nor was it the fear of allied victory slipping away at the last  moment, like some perpetually distant and elusive prize. The end of  Hitler's Third Reich was now inevitable and visibly close. Hostile  armies surrounded the Nazis in a tightening grip. In the flatlands  of Northwest Europe British, American and Canadian armies had  crossed the Rhine, the traditional guardian of Germany's western  frontier, and were pushing rapidly forward through Holland and  towards the great North Sea ports of Bremen and Hamburg.  <p>  On the bountiful granary plains of eastern Germany, Stalin's Red  Army had crossed the Rivers Oder and Neisse to reach the outer  suburbs of Berlin. Further south, the Soviet dictator's forces were  poised to link up with the Americans in the center of the country,  and in Austria his troops had already taken Vienna. In southern  Germany, American troops were driving rapidly up the Danube and deep  into Bavaria, Nazism's spiritual home, with its cities of Munich,  the Nazi Party headquarters, and Nuremberg, site of the torch-lit  rallies that had mesmerized the world just a few years before. In  Italy, allied forces were finally poised to make their crucial  breakout into the valley of the River Po with its arrow-straight  roads pointing north to the Alps and the Reich beyond.  <p>  However, unbearably, despite all this, Hitler refused to surrender.  Instead, his armies were fighting on with ferocious tenacity.  Soldiers and civilians alike now knew that this would be a fight to  the death, with all that this meant for them and for Europe.  Liberation would come to millions, but at a price made painfully  high because it seemed so needless. More soldiers and civilians  would die. More houses would be destroyed by bomb and artillery  shell. More fields and crops would be flooded by broken dams and  dikes, ruining crops and tightening the grip of hunger that had  already reduced millions to starvation. And more refugees would be  sent on their way along desolate roads with their pathetic bundles  of personal belongings slung on their backs or dragged in carts  behind them. This, indeed, was a bittersweet month.  <p>  Globally, the end of the war looked no less dark. Japan, like its  German ally, was battling back viciously to postpone the day of  defeat. The island-hopping advance of the Americans in the Pacific  had come to a bloody halt on rocky Okinawa, the last stop before the  Japanese mainland. Here, 120,000 Japanese troops supported by 10,000  aircraft were making a suicidal last stand against an army of  155,000 Americans that stormed ashore on the first day of the month.  Kamikaze pilots dive-bombed American warships and the Japanese  Imperial Navy sent the <i>Yamato</i>, the largest battleship in the world,  on a desperate last mission to ram as many enemy ships as it could.  The battle would end eighty days later with the ritual suicide of  the Japanese commander and his chief of staff, and with only 10,000  of the island's defenders still alive. With 50,000 dead and wounded  Americans, the fight for Okinawa offered a grim and worrying portent  of what could still lay ahead before Japan surrendered.  <p>  Politically, too, the shadows were deepening. At his death,  Roosevelt had yet to resolve the big question of how to deal with  Stalin and the Soviet Union; while his successor, Harry Truman, was  virtually unknown even to Americans and had little executive  experience. Britain's prime minister, Winston Churchill, was by now  full of dark foreboding about Soviet intentions in Europe and was  already using the term "Iron Curtain" to describe a Europe divided  between communism and democracy. Poland, for whose independence  Britain had gone to war in 1939, was already in the grip of the  communists. Would military victory turn to dust once the killing  stopped?  <p>  <p>  More than anything, Robert Ellis wanted to sleep. All night he had  clambered up the ridge dodging machine-gun and mortar fire.  Physically and mentally, he was drained. Now, even though it was  only early spring, the harsh Italian sun was scorching his skin. He  crouched deeper into his foxhole to escape its relentless glare, but  the ground was baked hard and his shelter was shallow.  <p>  Earth is the friend and final resting place of the combat  infantryman. There he takes cover, shelters and sleeps, but it is  also what he must capture and occupy. For six straight days, Ellis,  of the Tenth Mountain Division, had been fighting in the last big  push by the US Fifth Army to break out of the Apennine Mountains and  into the valley of the River Po.  <p>  It lay below him now, its fertile green plain stretching far into  the distance, representing both promise and threat. The grueling  weeks of scrambling up and down rock-strewn hillsides braving  withering enemy fire were over. But the river was wide and deep, a  natural barrier for the retreating yet stubborn enemy. The last  week's fighting had been the heaviest and most costly thus far for  the division. Three hundred and seventy men had been killed and some  fourteen hundred wounded. In Ellis's battalion alone, almost fifty  men had perished in just two days of fighting. He knew all too well  that many more men would die before victory came. It still seemed  far away.  <p>  He was twenty years old. Home was Wooster, Ohio, where his parents  had settled after years serving as Presbyterian missionaries in the  Persian city of Urumia. They had arrived in Urumia during the First  World War. "It was a battleground for Turkish and Russian troops,  Kurdish tribesmen, Assyrians, Armenians and other native partisans,"  he wrote. "Massacres and epidemics were the order of the day. My  father's medical services as a surgeon were desperately needed."  <p>  In 1918, his parents narrowly escaped a massacre of Christian  missionaries by Muslim Kurds. Already they had two small children,  both boys. A daughter followed three years later. Robert had  completed the family when he was born in 1924, finally arriving in  the States in the mid-1930s for more formal schooling.  <p>  Now, Ellis was heading a machine-gun squad in Company F of the  division's 85th Regiment, having recently been promoted to sergeant.  He had covered his helmet with burlap to reduce the reflection and  make himself less of a target to the enemy, and had decided not to  wear his sergeant's stripes on his shoulder. Like most of his  buddies, he assumed the Germans made special efforts to shoot  officers and NCOs to disrupt the chain of command.  <p>  There had been enough death anyway, without drawing attention to  yourself. Casualties were running high and one in particular came  shockingly close. On the first day of the offensive, Bill Luth, one  of his oldest friends in the division, had been killed. They went  back together to training days in Colorado, where they had enjoyed  one fabulous weekend's leave with a couple of other buddies in  Colorado Springs, singing fraternity and popular songs as they took  the breathtaking drive over the mountains in full moonlight. Bill  had come from Wisconsin, and Ellis had shared with him the cake his  mother had sent for his nineteenth birthday, just two days before  Bill's own.  <p>  Now, Ellis wasn't at all sure that he himself was going to make it.  "The war may seem very close to the end," he wrote to his parents,  "but to the men here who watch their comrades die each day the end  is far away." Preying vividly on his mind was the final,  heart-wrenching scene in <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>, the 1930s'  film version of Erich Maria Remarque's great anti-war bestseller  about the First World War. As he waits in his foxhole on the front,  the armistice signed but not yet in effect, the soldier hero reaches  out to touch a butterfly that has settled on a blade of grass only  to be shot dead by an enemy sniper.  <p>  No one now was keen to be killed, and self-inflicted wounds, to  provide an exit from the carnage, were not unusual. The risks did  not diminish because victory was close. Over the last few days  Ellis's company, along with others of the division, had advanced  slowly from hilltop to hilltop through deadly, often unsuspected  minefields as well as towards murderous machine-gun fire that raked  the slopes as men desperately scrambled for cover. Mortar and  artillery fire also caused dreadful wounds.  <p>  "Men were spun to the ground by the impact of bullets," writes one  historian of a typical Tenth Division firefight in the Apennines,  "sliced open by whirling jagged shards of shrapnel, atomized  by direct bursts from artillery and mortar shells, catapulted  into the air from the force of explosions, or thrown to the  ground in agony, screaming with pain, clutching at torn  limbs or spilled intestines, at jaws and genitals that  had disappeared." German <i>Schu</i> mines, undetectable  in their wooden boxes and scattered liberally over the  landscape, invariably blew off their victims' feet. In  such savage and bitter fighting, where American soldiers  saw friends killed or mortally wounded in terrible ways,  prisoners, especially wounded ones, were sometimes simply  shot. Ellis, like most young soldiers, was careful to  self-censor his letters home about such matters.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Endgame, 1945</b> by <b>David Stafford</b>  Copyright &copy 2007   by David Stafford.
