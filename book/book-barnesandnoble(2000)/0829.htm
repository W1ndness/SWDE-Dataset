His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performancesincluding a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable. Sedariss essays on living in Paris are some of the funniest hes ever written. At last, someone even meaner than the French! The sort of blithely sophisticated, loopy humour that might have resulted if Dorothy Parker and James Thurber had had a love child.

											A friend recommended Me Talk Pretty One Day to me years ago, and while I may never have picked it up if he hadn't, I think his recommendation ruined it a little for me. I had very, very high expectations, and though I thoroughly enjoyed reading this, I didn't find it nearly as hilarious as my friend did. Part of the problem may also have been that the second half of the book focuses entirely on David Sedaris' time living in France. He has some very funny stories to tell, but many of them rely on the old American Abroad stereotype---much cringing at loud tourists, clinging to the sound of English, etc. I much preferred the stories in the first half of the book, when I had absolutely no idea what strange, absurd things I might read next.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-1"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1305321_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780316776967_BK_24_1305321" href="#previewReview_1305321" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>February 11, 2010: 
											This book was a waste of my time and my book clubs time. If you are looking for a good laugh this is not it. Wasn't funny in the slightest. It was a sad, pathetic, obnoxious, waste of paper and binding. David Sedaris should not be allowed to write, it was that bad. An entire chapter on poop???!!!!  If the stories he tells are truthfully based on his life experiences, this book is a tragedy!!!!!!!  I'm not a fan of shows like Jerry Springer but if you are then maybe this book is for you. If you enjoy watching other peoples misery and stupidity then this book is for you!!!</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/37130000/37139530.JPG" alt="" height="164" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>David Sedaris</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>David Raymond Sedaris (full name)</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>London, England</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>December 26, 1956</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Johnson City, New York</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.F.A., School of the Art Institute of Chicago, 1987</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Thurber Prize, 2002; <i>Time</i> Humorist of the Year, 2001; <i>Advocate</i> Lambda Award, 2001</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>According to <I>Time Out New York</I>, "David Sedaris may be the funniest man alive." He's the sort of writer critics tend to describe not in terms of literary influences and trends, but in terms of what they choked on while reading his latest book. "I spewed a mouthful of pastrami across my desk," admitted Craig Seligman in his <I>New York Times</I> review of <I>Naked</I>.  <p>  Sedaris first drew national attention in 1992 with a stint on National Public Radio, on which he recounted his experiences as a Christmas elf at Macy's. He discussed "the code names for various posts, such as 'The Vomit Corner,' a mirrored wall near the Magic Tree" and confided that his response to "I'm going to have you fired" was the desire to lean over and say, "I'm going to have you killed." The radio pieces were such a hit that Sedaris, then working as a house cleaner, started getting offers to write movies, soap operas and <I>Seinfeld</I> episodes.<p>    In subsequent appearances on NPR, Sedaris proved he wasn't just a velvet-clad flash in the pan; he's also wickedly funny on the subjects of smoking, speed, shoplifting and nervous tics. His work began appearing in magazines like <I>Harper's</I> and <I>Mirabella</I>, and his first book <I>Barrel Fever</I>, which included "SantaLand Diaries," was a bestseller. "These hilarious, lively and breathtakingly irreverent stories... made me laugh out loud more than anything I've read in years," wrote Francine Prose in the <I>Washington Post Book World</i>.<p>    Since then, each successive Sedaris volume has zoomed to the top of the bestseller lists. In Naked, he recounts odd jobs like volunteering at a mental hospital, picking apples as a seasonal laborer and stripping woodwork for a Nazi sympathizer. The stocking stuffer-sized Holidays on Ice collects Sedaris' Christmas-themed work, including a fictional holiday newsletter from the homicidal stepmother of a 22-year-old Vietnamese immigrant ("She arrived in this house six weeks ago speaking only the words 'Daddy,' 'Shiny' and 'Five dollar now'. Quite a vocabulary!!!!!").<p>    But Sedaris' best pieces often revolve around his childhood in North Carolina and his family of six siblings, including the brother who talks like a redneck gangsta rapper and the sister who, in a hilarious passage far too dirty to quote here, introduces him to the joys of the Internet. Sedaris' recent book <I>Me Talk Pretty One Day</I> describes, among other things, his efforts to learn French while helping his boyfriend fix up a Normandy farmhouse; he progresses "from speaking like an evil baby to speaking like a hillbilly. 'Is thems the thoughts of cows?' I'd ask the butcher, pointing to the calves' brains displayed in the front window."<p>    Sedaris has been compared to American humorists such as Mark Twain, James Thurber and Dorothy Parker; <I>Publisher's Weekly</I> called him "Garrison Keillor's evil twin." Pretty heady stuff for a man who claims there are cats that weigh more than his IQ score. But as <I>This American Life</I> producer Ira Glass once pointed out, it would be wrong to think of Sedaris as "just a working Joe who happens to put out these perfectly constructed pieces of prose." Measured by his ability to turn his experiences into a sharply satirical, sidesplittingly funny form of art, David Sedaris is no less than a genius.</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Sedaris got his start</b> in radio after <I>This American Life</I> producer Ira Glass saw him perform at Club Lower Links in Chicago. In addition to his NPR commentaries, Sedaris now writes regularly for <I>Esquire</I>.<p>    <b>Sedaris's younger sister Amy</b> is also a writer and performer; the two have collaborated on plays under the moniker "The Talent Family."  Amy Sedaris has appeared onstage as a member of the Second City improv troupe and on Comedy Central in the series <I>Strangers with Candy</I>. <p>    <b>"If I weren't a writer,</b> I'd be a taxidermist," Sedaris said in a chat on Barnes and Noble.com. According to the <I>Boston Phoenix</I>, his collection of stuffed dead animals includes a squirrel, two fruit bats, four Boston terriers and a baby ostrich.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the spring of 2004, David Sedaris took some time to talk with us about some of his favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>  I guess it would be <I>Cathedral</I> by Raymond Carver. His sentences are very simple and straightforward, and he made writing seem deceptively easy -- the kind of thing anyone could do if they put their mind to it. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>    <li><I>Among the Thugs</I> by Bill Buford -- This is a nonfiction account of English football hooligans. At one point a drunk guy actually sucks the eyeball out of somebody's head. <p>    <li><I>Birds of America</I> by Lorrie Moore -- Her stories read like a collection of one-liners, yet at the end, you're devastated. How does she do it? <p>    <li><I>Collected Stories</I> by Flannery O'Connor -- No one writes dialect better than Flannery O'Connor. No one should even try. <p>    <li><I>An Obedient Father</I> by Akhil Sharma -- I love any book in which monkeys break into the women's bathroom. <p>    <li><I>Is There No Place on Earth for Me?</I> by Susan Sheehan -- This is a nonfiction book about a paranoid schizophrenic named Sylvia Frumpkin.<p>    <li><I>A Prison and a Prisoner</I>, <I>A Welfare Mother</I>, <I>Life for Me Ain't Been No Crystal Stair</I>; I love all of Susan Sheehan's books. Her writing is clean, and while it's sometimes technical, it's never sterile. <p>    <li><I>A Violent Act</I> by Alec Wilkinson -- This is a nonfiction account of a mentally ill man who killed several people in the Midwest. Most crime stories focus all their attention on the criminal and those who attempt to catch him, but this comes back to the family of one of the victims, and conveys their relentless grief. <p>    <li><I>In the Garden of the North American Martyrs</I> by Tobias Wolff -- His stories are like parables, and after reading one I always vow to become a better person. <p>    <li><I>The Barracks Thief</I> by Tobias Wolff -- It breaks my heart when the dad tools around on the little folding bicycle. <p>    <li><I>Revolutionary Road</I> by Richard Yates --This was his first novel and I read it once a year. Aside from its word-by-word construction, I love how his characters deceive themselves. <p>    <li><I>The Easter Parade</I> by Richard Yates -- This novel follows the lives of two sisters, and while it is incredibly depressing, the writing is magnificent.<p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you? </b><br>  It's hard for me to think in terms of favorites, and even harder to articulate why I liked something. I go to the movies at least five times a week, and after a while everything becomes a blur to me. The last thing to leave a noticeable impression was a revival of <I>Hard Eight</I> by Paul Thomas Anderson. I especially loved the scene where John C. Reilly explains his vendetta against matches. <p>      <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I like books on tape, and will listen to just about anything. My current favorites are the Agatha Christie Miss Marple novels read by Joan Hickson, and Allen Bennett's <I>Talking Heads</I>, which I listen to over and over. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I tend to just get up and go to work. In the afternoon, I eat lunch and go out, usually to the movies. At around eight I go back to my desk for an hour, and if I have a deadline I'll stay up late or work through the night. Aside from an ashtray, I don't keep anything special on or above my desk. <p>      <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take you to get where you are today? Any rejection slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes? </b><br>  I started writing when I was twenty, and my first book came out seventeen years later. At some point in between, while I was a student at The School of The Art Institute, my teacher, Jim McManus, suggested I send a batch of stories to his publisher, which at the time was Grove Press. I've never been very good at submitting things -- it feels pushy to me -- but at his urging I sent them a half dozen stories and received in return a very kind rejection letter. <p>    After graduating, I started reading out loud. There used to be this little club in Chicago, Lower Links it was called, and my friends and I would often perform there. One night, Ira Glass heard me read, and he called a few years later asking if I would like to be on the radio. That pretty much changed everything for me, and after my first broadcast an editor from Little, Brown called asking if I had a book. I did, and they published it. I was 37 when <I>Barrel Fever</I> came out. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers?</b><br>  The only real advice you can give anyone is to keep writing. Eventually, hopefully, you'll be published in a small literary journal and can work your way up from there. I don't think pushiness helps at all. It's unbecoming and bespeaks a talent for self-promotion rather than for writing.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>A new collection from David Sedaris is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performancesincluding a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable. Sedariss essays on living in Paris are some of the funniest hes ever written. At last, someone even meaner than the French! The sort of blithely sophisticated, loopy humour that might have resulted if Dorothy Parker and James Thurber had had a love child. Entertainment Weekly on Barrel Fever Sidesplitting Not one of the essays in this new collection failed to crack me up; frequently I was helpless. The New York Times Book Review on Naked
</p><h3>New York Times Book Review</h3><p>...reveal a writer who is capable not only of being funny, but touching, even tender, too..
</p><h3>Los Angeles Times</h3><p>Original, acid, and wild.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Sedaris is Garrison Keillor's evil twin: like the Minnesota humorist, Sedaris (<i>Naked</i>) focuses on the icy patches that mark life's sidewalk, though the ice in his work is much more slippery and the falls much more spectacularly funny than in Keillor's. Many of the 27 short essays collected here (which appeared originally in <i>the New Yorker</i>, <i>Esquire</i> and elsewhere) deal with his father, Lou, to whom the book is dedicated. Lou is a micromanager who tries to get his uninterested children to form a jazz combo and, when that fails, insists on boosting David's career as a performance artist by heckling him from the audience. Sedaris suggests that his father's punishment for being overly involved in his kids' artistic lives is David's brother Paul, otherwise known as "The Rooster," a half-literate miscreant whose language is outrageously profane. Sedaris also writes here about the time he spent in France and the difficulty of learning another language. After several extended stays in a little Norman village and in Paris, Sedaris had progressed, he observes, "from speaking like an evil baby to speaking like a hillbilly. `Is thems the thoughts of cows?' I'd ask the butcher, pointing to the calves' brains displayed in the front window." But in English, Sedaris is nothing if not nimble: in one essay he goes from his cat's cremation to his mother's in a way that somehow manages to remain reverent to both of the departed. "Reliable sources" have told Sedaris that he has "tended to exhaust people," and true to form, he will exhaust readers of this new book, too--with helpless laughter.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Sedaris, noted essayist and NPR radio commentator, is a master at turning his life experiences into witty vignettes that both entertain and comment on the human condition. This latest collection draws on his quirky childhood in North Carolina, where he was subjected to speech therapy sessions to correct his lisp; he countered by conveniently avoiding words that contained "s" sounds. Additional family recollections include his father's desire to create a jazz combo from his offspring--unfortunately, none of them exhibited any talent or desire to follow this career path, but Sedaris uses this opportunity to deliver a stellar Billie Holiday rendition. From there he moves onto a brief stint as a "clearly unqualified" writing teacher in Chicago, where his unorthodox lesson plans included watching soap operas and having the students write "guessays" on what would happen in the next episode. Then it's on to New York and ultimately to France. Sedaris chronicles his attempts to learn French and the confusion experienced by people who don't share the same culture or language. A little sadder at times and overall a little less uproariously funny than in previous works, Sedaris remains the champion of the underdog. Once you listen to him read his own words, it's hard to imagine settling for just the book. Very highly recommended for all libraries.--Gloria Maxwell, Penn Valley Community Coll., Kansas City, MO Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.
</p><h3>Entertainment Weekly - 
								Lisa  Schwarzbaum</h3><p>As <i>Me Talk Pretty One Day</i> attests, these days Sedaris glitters as one of the wittiest writers around, an essayist and radio commentator who only appears to be telling simple then-what-happened anecdotes...it's no wonder Sedaris is in such demand as a beacon of comic sanity in a terminally chic world.</p><h3>The New Yorker</h3><p>This fourth collection of short pieces offers pleasures normally to be found only in the best novels and the rare standup act that is actually funny.</p><h3></h3><p>Sedaris has made a name for himself in several entertainment arenas: National Public Radio, live performances, printed books and audiobooks. His fourth collection of essays has lost none of the energy of his previous work. Sedaris' selection covers a wide range of subjects, from guitar lessons to haughty Manhattan eateries to a sister who wears padded fat suits. Sedaris does not have a slick, well-modulated voice but that of a somewhat high-pitched character actor. It is a humorous voice matched by a deadpan delivery that is just a hoot.</p><h3>The Christian Science Monitor - 
								Daphne Eviatar</h3><p>From temping as a Macy's Christmas elf to enduring the humiliation of French class in Paris, Mr. Sedaris's peculiar genius lies in his ability to transform the mortification of everyday life into wildly entertaining art.  His third book is another compilation of hysterical essays, many originally broadcast on National Public Radio or published in <i>Esquire</i>.  The first half of his new book is devoted to stories about childhood, and the second half to tales of his new life in France.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>The undisputed champion of the self-conscious and the self-deprecating returns with yet more autobiographical gems from his apparently inexhaustible cache (Naked, 1997, etc.). Sedaris at first mines what may be the most idiosyncratic, if innocuous, childhood since the McCourt clan. Here is father Lou, who&#39;s propositioned, via phone, by married family friend Mrs. Midland (&quot;Oh, Lou. It just feels so good to . . . talk to someone who really . . . understands&quot;). Only years later is it divulged that &quot;Mrs. Midland&quot; was impersonated by Lou&#39;s 12-year-old daughter Amy. (Lou, to the prankster&#39;s relief, always politely declined Mrs. Midland&#39;s overtures.) Meanwhile, Mrs. Sedaris&#151;soon after she&#39;s put a beloved sick cat to sleep&#151;is terrorized by bogus reports of a &quot;miraculous new cure for feline leukemia,&quot; all orchestrated by her bitter children. Brilliant evildoing in this family is not unique to the author. Sedaris (also an essayist on National Public Radio) approaches comic preeminence as he details his futile attempts, as an adult, to learn the French language. Having moved to Paris, he enrolls in French class and struggles endlessly with the logic in assigning inanimate objects a gender (&quot;Why refer to Lady Flesh Wound or Good Sir Dishrag when these things could never live up to all that their sex implied?&quot;). After months of this, Sedaris finds that the first French-spoken sentiment he&#39;s fully understood has been directed to him by his sadistic teacher&#58; &quot;Every day spent with you is like having a cesarean section.&quot; Among these misadventures, Sedaris catalogs his many bugaboos&#58; the cigarette ban in NewYorkrestaurants (&quot;I&#39;m always searching the menu in hope that some courageous young chef has finally recognized tobacco as a vegetable&quot;); the appending of company Web addresses to television commercials (&quot;Who really wants to know more about Procter & Gamble?&quot;); and a scatological dilemma that would likely remain taboo in most households. Naughty good fun from an impossibly sardonic rogue, quickly rising to Twainian stature.<P>

</div><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3>Chapter One<br><br>Go Carolina<br><br> Anyone Who Watches Even The Slightest amount of TV is familiar with the scene&#58; An agent knocks on the door of some seemingly ordinary home or office. The door opens, and the person holding the knob is asked to identify himself. The agent then says, "I'm going to ask you to come with me."<br><br> They're always remarkably calm, these agents. If asked "Why do I need to go anywhere with you?" they'll straighten their shirt cuffs or idly brush stray hairs from the sleeves of their sport coats and say, "Oh, I think we both know why."<br><br> The suspect then chooses between doing things the hard way and doing things the easy way, and the scene ends with either gunfire or the gentlemanly application of handcuffs. Occasionally it's a case of mistaken identity, but most often the suspect knows exactly why he's being taken. It seems he's been expecting this to happen. The anticipation has ruled his life, and now, finally, the wait is over. You're sometimes led to believe that this person is actually relieved, but I've never bought it. Though it probably has its moments, the average day spent in hiding is bound to beat the average day spent in prison. When it comes time to decide who gets the bottom bunk, I think anyone would agree that there's a lot to be said for doing things the hard way.<br><br> The agent came for me during a geography lesson. She entered the room and nodded at my fifth-grade teacher, who stood frowning at a map of Europe. What would needle me later was the realization that this had all been prearranged. My capture had been scheduled to go down at exactly 2&#58;30 on a Thursday afternoon. The agent would be wearing a dung-colored blazer over a red knit turtleneck, her heels sensibly low in case the suspect should attempt a quick getaway.<br><br> "David," the teacher said, "this is Miss Samson, and she'd like you to go with her now."<br><br> No one else had been called, so why me? I ran down a list of recent crimes, looking for a conviction that might stick. Setting fire to a reportedly flameproof Halloween costume, stealing a set of barbecue tongs from an unguarded patio, altering the word hit on a list of rules posted on the gymnasium door; never did it occur to me that I might be innocent.<br><br> "You might want to take your books with you," the teacher said. "And your jacket. You probably won't be back before the bell rings."<br><br> Though she seemed old at the time, the agent was most likely fresh out of college. She walked beside me and asked what appeared to be an innocent and unrelated question&#58; "So, which do you like better, State or Carolina?"<br><br> She was referring to the athletic rivalry between the Triangle area's two largest universities. Those who cared about such things tended to express their allegiance by wearing either Tar Heel powder blue, or Wolf Pack red, two colors that managed to look good on no one. The question of team preference was common in our part of North Carolina, and the answer supposedly spoke volumes about the kind of person you either were or hoped to become. I had no interest in football or basketball but had learned it was best to pretend otherwise. If a boy didn't care for barbecued chicken or potato chips, people would accept it as a matter of personal taste, saying, "Oh well, I guess it takes all kinds." You could turn up your nose at the president or Coke or even God, but there were names for boys who didn't like sports. When the subject came up, I found it best to ask which team my questioner preferred. Then I'd say, "Really? Me, too!"<br><br> Asked by the agent which team I supported, I took my cue from her red turtleneck and told her that I was for State. "Definitely State. State all the way."<br><br> It was an answer I would regret for years to come.<br><br> "State, did you say?" the agent asked.<br><br> "Yes, State. They're the greatest."<br><br> "I see." She led me through an unmarked door near the principal's office, into a small, windowless room furnished with two facing desks. It was the kind of room where you'd grill someone until they snapped, the kind frequently painted so as to cover the bloodstains. She gestured toward what was to become my regular seat, then continued her line of questioning.<br><br> "And what exactly are they, State and Carolina?"<br><br> "Colleges? Universities?"<br><br> She opened a file on her desk, saying, "Yes, you're right. Your answers are correct, but you're saying them incorrectly. You're telling me that they're collegeth and univerthitieth, when actually they're colleges and universities. You're giving me a th sound instead of a nice clear s. Can you hear the distinction between the two different sounds?"<br><br> I nodded.<br><br> "May I please have an actual answer?"<br><br> "Uh-huh."<br><br> " 'Uh-huh' is not a word."<br><br> "Okay."<br><br> "Okay what?"<br><br> "Okay," I said. "Sure, I can hear it."<br><br> "You can hear what, the distinction? The contrast?"<br><br> "Yeah, that."<br><br> It was the first battle of my war against the letter s, and I was determined to dig my foxhole before the sun went down. According to Agent Samson, a "state certified speech therapist," my s was sibilate, meaning that I lisped. This was not news to me.<br><br> "Our goal is to work together until eventually you can speak correctly," Agent Samson said. She made a great show of enunciating her own sparkling s's, and the effect was profoundly irritating. "I'm trying to help you, but the longer you play these little games the longer this is going to take."<br><br> The woman spoke with a heavy western North Carolina accent, which I used to discredit her authority. Here was a person for whom the word pen had two syllables. Her people undoubtedly drank from clay jugs and hollered for Paw when the vittles were ready - so who was she to advise me on anything? Over the coming years I would find a crack in each of the therapists sent to train what Miss Samson now defined as my lazy tongue. "That's its problem," she said. "It's just plain lazy."<br><br> My sisters Amy and Gretchen were, at the time, undergoing therapy for their lazy eyes, while my older sister, Lisa, had been born with a lazy leg that had refused to grow at the same rate as its twin. She'd worn a corrective brace for the first two years of her life, and wherever she roamed she left a trail of scratch marks in the soft pine floor. I liked the idea that a part of one's body might be thought of as lazy - not thoughtless or hostile, just unwilling to extend itself for the betterment of the team. My father often accused my mother of having a lazy mind, while she in turn accused him of having a lazy index finger, unable to dial the phone when he knew damn well he was going to be late.<br><br> My therapy sessions were scheduled for every Thursday at 2&#58;30, and with the exception of my mother, I discussed them with no one. The word therapy suggested a profound failure on my part. Mental patients had therapy. Normal people did not. I didn't see my sessions as the sort of thing that one would want to advertise, but as my teacher liked to say, "I guess it takes all kinds." Whereas my goal was to keep it a secret, hers was to inform the entire class. If I got up from my seat at 2&#58;25, she'd say, "Sit back down, David. You've still got five minutes before your speech therapy session." If I remained seated until 2&#58;27, she'd say, "David, don't forget you have a speech therapy session at two-thirty." On the days I was absent, I imagined she addressed the room, saying, "David's not here today but if he were, he'd have a speech therapy session at two-thirty."<br><br> My sessions varied from week to week. Sometimes I'd spend the half hour parroting whatever Agent Samson had to say. We'd occasionally pass the time examining charts on tongue position or reading childish s-laden texts recounting the adventures of seals or settlers named Sassy or Samuel. On the worst of days she'd haul out a tape recorder and show me just how much progress I was failing to make. <br><br> "My speech therapist's name is Miss Chrissy Samson." She'd hand me the microphone and lean back with her arms crossed. "Go ahead, say it. I want you to hear what you sound like."<br><br> She was in love with the sound of her own name and seemed to view my speech impediment as a personal assault. If I wanted to spend the rest of my life as David Thedarith, then so be it. She, however, was going to be called Miss Chrissy Samson. Had her name included no s's, she probably would have bypassed a career in therapy and devoted herself to yanking out healthy molars or performing unwanted clitoridectomies on the schoolgirls of Africa. Such was her personality. <br><br> "Oh, come on," my mother would say. "I'm sure she's not that bad. Give her a break. The girl's just trying to do her job."<br><br> I was a few minutes early one week and entered the office to find Agent Samson doing her job on Garth Barclay, a slight, kittenish boy I'd met back in the fourth grade. "You may wait outside in the hallway until it is your turn," she told me. A week or two later my session was interrupted by mincing Steve Bixler, who popped his head in the door and announced that his parents were taking him out of town for a long weekend, meaning that he would miss his regular Friday session. "Thorry about that," he said.<br><br> I started keeping watch over the speech therapy door, taking note of who came and went. Had I seen one popular student leaving the office, I could have believed my mother and viewed my lisp as the sort of thing that might happen to anyone. Unfortunately, I saw no popular students. Chuck Coggins, Sam Shelton, Louis Delucca&#58; obviously, there was some connection between a sibilate s and a complete lack of interest in the State versus Carolina issue.<br><br> None of the therapy students were girls. They were all boys like me who kept movie star scrapbooks and made their own curtains. "You don't want to be doing that," the men in our families would say. "That's a girl thing." Baking scones and cupcakes for the school janitors, watching Guiding Light with our mothers, collecting rose petals for use in a fragrant potpourri&#58; anything worth doing turned out to be a girl thing. In order to enjoy ourselves, we learned to be duplicitous. Our stacks of Cosmopolitan were topped with an unread issue of Boy's Life or Sports Illustrated, and our decoupage projects were concealed beneath the sporting equipment we never asked for but always received. When asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, we hid the truth and listed who we wanted to sleep with when we grew up. "A policeman or a fireman or one of those guys who works with high-tension wires." Symptoms were feigned, and our mothers wrote notes excusing our absences on the day of the intramural softball tournament. Brian had a stomach virus or Ted suffered from that twenty-four-hour bug that seemed to be going around.<br><br> "One of these days I'm going to have to hang a sign on that door," Agent Samson used to say. She was probably thinking along the lines of SPEECH THERAPY LAB, though a more appropriate marker would have read FUTURE HOMOSEXUALS OF AMERICA. We knocked ourselves out trying to fit in but were ultimately betrayed by our tongues. At the beginning of the school year, while we were congratulating ourselves on successfully passing for normal, Agent Samson was taking names as our assembled teachers raised their hands, saying, "I've got one in my homeroom," and "There are two in my fourth-period math class." Were they also able to spot the future drunks and depressives? Did they hope that by eliminating our lisps, they might set us on a different path, or were they trying to prepare us for future stage and choral careers?<br><br> Miss Samson instructed me, when forming an s, to position the tip of my tongue against the rear of my top teeth, right up against the gum line. The effect produced a sound not unlike that of a tire releasing air. It was awkward and strange-sounding, and elicited much more attention than the original lisp. I failed to see the hissy s as a solution to the problem and continued to talk normally, at least at home, where my lazy tongue fell upon equally lazy ears. At school, where every teacher was a potential spy, I tried to avoid an s sound whenever possible. "Yes," became "correct," or a military "affirmative." "Please," became "with your kind permission," and questions were pleaded rather than asked. After a few weeks of what she called "endless pestering" and what I called "repeated badgering," my mother bought me a pocket thesaurus, which provided me with s-free alternatives to just about everything. I consulted the book both at home in my room and at the daily learning academy other people called our school. Agent Samson was not amused when I began referring to her as an articulation coach, but the majority of my teachers were delighted. "What a nice vocabulary," they said. "My goodness, such big words!"<br><br> Plurals presented a considerable problem, but I worked around them as best I could; "rivers," for example, became either "a river or two" or "many a river." Possessives were a similar headache, and it was easier to say nothing than to announce that the left-hand and the right-hand glove of Janet had fallen to the floor. After all the compliments I had received on my improved vocabulary, it seemed prudent to lie low and keep my mouth shut. I didn't want anyone thinking I was trying to be a pet of the teacher.<br><br> When I first began my speech therapy, I worried that the Agent Samson plan might work for everyone but me, that the other boys might strengthen their lazy tongues, turn their lives around, and leave me stranded. Luckily my fears were never realized. Despite the woman's best efforts, no one seemed to make any significant improvement. The only difference was that we were all a little quieter. Thanks to Agent Samson's tape recorder, I, along with the others, now had a clear sense of what I actually sounded like. There was the lisp, of course, but more troubling was my voice itself, with its excitable tone and high, girlish pitch. I'd hear myself ordering lunch in the cafeteria, and the sound would turn my stomach. How could anyone stand to listen to me? Whereas those around me might grow up to be lawyers or movie stars, my only option was to take a vow of silence and become a monk. My former classmates would call the abbey, wondering how I was doing, and the priest would answer the phone. "You can't talk to him!" he'd say. "Why, Brother David hasn't spoken to anyone in thirty-five years!"<br><br> "Oh, relax," my mother said. "Your voice will change eventually."<br><br> "And what if it doesn't?"<br><br> She shuddered. "Don't be so morbid."<br><br> It turned out that Agent Samson was something along the lines of a circuit-court speech therapist. She spent four months at our school and then moved on to another. Our last meeting was held the day before school let out for Christmas. My classrooms were all decorated, the halls - everything but her office, which remained as bare as ever. I was expecting a regular half hour of Sassy the seal and was delighted to find her packing up her tape recorder.<br><br> "I thought that this afternoon we might let loose and have a party, you and I. How does that sound?" She reached into her desk drawer and withdrew a festive tin of cookies. "Here, have one. I made them myself from scratch and, boy, was it a mess! Do you ever make cookies?"<br><br> I lied, saying that no, I never had.<br><br> "Well, it's hard work," she said. "Especially if you don't have a mixer."<br><br> It was unlike Agent Samson to speak so casually, and awkward to sit in the hot little room, pretending to have a normal conversation.<br><br> "So," she said, "what are your plans for the holidays?"<br><br> "Well, I usually remain here and, you know, open a gift from my family."<br><br> "Only one?" she asked.<br><br> "Maybe eight or ten."<br><br> "Never six or seven?"<br><br> "Rarely," I said.<br><br> "And what do you do on December thirty-first, New Year's Eve?"<br><br> "On the final day of the year we take down the pine tree in our living room and eat marine life."<br><br> "You're pretty good at avoiding those s's," she said. "I have to hand it to you, you're tougher than most."<br><br> I thought she would continue trying to trip me up, but instead she talked about her own holiday plans. "It's pretty hard with my fianc&eacute; in Vietnam," she said. "Last year we went up to see his folks in Roanoke, but this year I'll spend Christmas with my grandmother outside of Asheville. My parents will come, and we'll all try our best to have a good time. I'll eat some turkey and go to church, and then, the next day, a friend and I will drive down to Jacksonville to watch Florida play Tennessee in the Gator Bowl."<br><br> I couldn't imagine anything worse than driving down to Florida to watch a football game, but I pretended to be impressed. "Wow, that ought to be eventful."<br><br> "I was in Memphis last year when NC State whooped Georgia fourteen to seven in the Liberty Bowl," she said. "And next year, I don't care who's playing, but I want to be sitting front-row center at the Tangerine Bowl. Have you ever been to Orlando? It's a super fun place. If my future husband can find a job in his field, we're hoping to move down there within a year or two. Me living in Florida. I bet that would make you happy, wouldn't it?"<br><br> I didn't quite know how to respond. Who was this college bowl fanatic with no mixer and a fianc&eacute; in Vietnam, and why had she taken so long to reveal herself? Here I'd thought of her as a cold-blooded agent when she was really nothing but a slightly dopey, inexperienced speech teacher. She wasn't a bad person, Miss Samson, but her timing was off. She should have acted friendly at the beginning of the year instead of waiting until now, when all I could do was feel sorry for her.<br><br> "I tried my best to work with you and the others, but sometimes a person's best just isn't good enough." She took another cookie and turned it over in her hands. "I really wanted to prove myself and make a difference in people's lives, but it's hard to do your job when you're met with so much resistance. My students don't like me, and I guess that's just the way it is. What can I say? As a speech teacher, I'm a complete failure."<br><br> She moved her hands toward her face, and I worried that she might start to cry. "Hey, look," I said. "I'm thorry."<br><br> "Ha-ha," she said. "I got you." She laughed much more than she needed to and was still at it when she signed the form recommending me for the following year's speech therapy program. "Thorry, indeed. You've got some work ahead of you, mister."<br><br> I related the story to my mother, who got a huge kick out of it. "You've got to admit that you really are a sucker," she said.<br><br> I agreed but, because none of my speech classes ever made a difference, I still prefer to use the word chump.<br><br> Copyright (c) 2000 by David Sedaris"<br><br>
<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><P> <BR> <P> <FONT SIZE="+2"> Chapter One </FONT><P> <P> Go Carolina <P> <BR> <P> ANYONE WHO WATCHES EVEN THE SLIGHTEST amount of TV is familiar with the scene&#58; An agent knocks on the door of some seemingly ordinary home or office. The door opens, and the person holding the knob is asked to identify himself. The agent then says, "I'm going to ask you to come with me." <P> They're always remarkably calm, these agents. If asked "Why do I need to go anywhere with you?" they'll straighten their shirt cuffs or idly brush stray hairs from the sleeves of their sport coats and say, "Oh, I think we both know why." <P> The suspect then chooses between doing things the hard way and doing things the easy way, and the scene ends with either gunfire or the gentlemanly application of handcuffs. Occasionally it's a case of mistaken identity, but most often the suspect knows exactly why he's being taken. It seems he's been expecting this to happen. The anticipation has ruled his life, and now, finally, the wait is over. You're sometimes led to believe that this person is actually relieved, but I've never bought it. Though it probably has its moments, the average day spent in hiding is bound to beat the average day spent in prison. When it comes time to decide who gets the bottom bunk, I think anyone would agree that there's a lot to be said for doing things the hard way. <P> The agent came for me during a geography lesson. She entered the room and nodded at my fifth-grade teacher, who stood frowning at a map of Europe. What would needle me later was the realization that this had all been prearranged. My capture had been scheduled to go down at exactly 2&#58;30 on a Thursday afternoon. Theagent would be wearing a dung-colored blazer over a red knit turtleneck, her heels sensibly low in case the suspect should attempt a quick getaway. <P> "David," the teacher said, "this is Miss Samson, and she'd like you to go with her now." <P> No one else had been called, so why me? I ran down a list of recent crimes, looking for a conviction that might stick. Setting fire to a reportedly flameproof Halloween costume, stealing a set of barbecue tongs from an unguarded patio, altering the word on a list of rules posted on the gymnasium door; never did it occur to me that I might be innocent. <P> "You might want to take your books with you," the teacher said. "And your jacket. You probably won't be back before the bell rings." <P> Though she seemed old at the time, the agent was most likely fresh out of college. She walked beside me and asked what appeared to be an innocent and unrelated question&#58; "So, which do you like better, State or Carolina?" <P> She was referring to the athletic rivalry between the Triangle area's two largest universities. Those who cared about such things tended to express their allegiance by wearing either Tar Heel powder blue, or Wolf Pack red, two colors that managed to look good on no one. The question of team preference was common in our part of North Carolina, and the answer supposedly spoke volumes about the kind of person you either were or hoped to become. I had no interest in football or basketball but had learned it was best to pretend otherwise. If a boy didn't care for barbecued chicken or potato chips, people would accept it as a matter of personal taste, saying, "Oh well, I guess it takes all kinds." You could turn up your nose at the president or Coke or even God, but there were names for boys who didn't like sports. When the subject came up, I found it best to ask which team my questioner preferred. Then I'd say, "Really? Me, too!" <P> Asked by the agent which team I supported, I took my cue from her red turtleneck and told her that I was for State. "Definitely State. State all the way." <P> It was an answer I would regret for years to come. <P> "State, did you say?" the agent asked. <P> "Yes, State. They're the greatest." <P> "I see." She led me through an unmarked door near the principal's office, into a small, windowless room furnished with two facing desks. It was the kind of room where you'd grill someone until they snapped, the kind frequently painted so as to cover the bloodstains. She gestured toward what was to become my regular seat, then continued her line of questioning. <P> "And what exactly are they, State and Carolina?" <P> "Colleges? Universities?" <P> She opened a file on her desk, saying, "Yes, you're right. Your answers are correct, but you're saying them incorrectly. You're telling me that they're colleg <I>eth</I> and univeritie <I>th,</I> when actually they're college <I>s</I> and univer <I>s</I> <I>itie</I> <I>s.</I> You're giving me a <I>th</I> sound instead of a nice clear <I>s.</I> "Can you hear the di <I>s</I> tinction between the two different <I>s</I> sound <I>s</I>?" <P> I nodded. <P> "May I plea <I>s</I> <I>e</I> have an actual an <I>s</I> wer?" <P> "Uh-huh." <P> " 'Uh-huh' i <I>s</I> not a word." <P> "Okay." <P> "Okay what?" <P> "Okay," I said. "Sure, I can hear it." <P> "You can hear what, the di <I>s</I> tinction? The contra <I>s</I> t?" <P> "Yeah, that." <P> It was the first battle of my war against the letter <I>s,</I> and I was determined to dig my foxhole before the sun went down. According to Agent Samson, a <I>s</I> tate <I>c</I> ertified <I>s</I> peech therapi <I>s</I> t," my <I>s</I> was sibilate, meaning that I lisped. <P> This was not news to me. <P> "Our goal i <I>s</I> to work together until eventually you can <I>s</I> peak correctly," Agent Samson said. She made a great show of enunciating her own sparkling <I>s</I>'s, and the effect was profoundly irritating. "I'm trying to help you, but the longer you play the <I>s</I> e little game <I>s</I> the longer thi <I>s</I> i <I>s</I> going to take." <P> The woman spoke with a heavy western North Carolina accent, which I used to discredit her authority. Here was a person for whom the word <I>pen</I> had two syllables. Her people undoubtedly drank from clay jugs and hollered for Paw when the vittles were ready &#151; so who was she to advise me on anything? Over the coming years I would find a crack in each of the therapists sent to train what Miss Samson now defined as my lazy tongue. "That <I>'s</I> it <I>s</I> problem," she said. "It'<I>s</I> ju <I>s</I> t plain lazy." <P> My sisters Amy and Gretchen were, at the time, undergoing therapy for their lazy eyes, while my older sister, Lisa, had been born with a lazy leg that had refused to grow at the same rate as its twin. She'd worn a corrective brace for the first two years of her life, and wherever she roamed she left a trail of scratch marks in the soft pine floor. I liked the idea that a part of one's body might be thought of as lazy &#151; not thoughtless or hostile, just unwilling to extend itself for the betterment of the team. My father often accused my mother of having a lazy mind, while she in turn accused him of having a lazy index finger, unable to dial the phone when he knew damn well he was going to be late. <P> My therapy sessions were scheduled for every Thursday at 2&#58; 30, and with the exception of my mother, I discussed them with no one. The word <I>therapy</I> suggested a profound failure on my part. Mental patients had therapy. Normal people did not. I didn't see my sessions as the sort of thing that one would want to advertise, but as my teacher liked to say, "I guess it takes all kinds." Whereas my goal was to keep it a secret, hers was to inform the entire class. If I got up from my seat at 2&#58;30 , she'd say, "Sit back down, David. You've still got five minutes before your speech therapy session." If I remained seated until 2&#58;30 , she'd say, "David, don't forget you have a speech therapy session at two-thirty." On the days I was absent, I imagined she addressed the room, saying, "David's not here today but if he were, he'd have a speech therapy session at two-thirty." <P> My sessions varied from week to week. Sometimes I'd spend the half hour parroting whatever Agent Samson had to say. We'd occasionally pass the time examining charts on tongue position or reading childish <I>s</I>-laden texts recounting the adventures of seals or settlers named Sassy or Samuel. On the worst of days she'd haul out a tape recorder and show me just how much progress I was failing to make. <P> "My <I>s</I> peech therapi <I>s</I> "t'<I>s</I> name i <I>s</I> Mi <I>ss</I> Chri <I>ss</I> y <I>S</I> am <I>s</I> on." She'd hand me the microphone and lean back with her arms crossed. "Go ahead, <I>s</I> ay it. I want you to hear what you <I>s</I> ound like." <P> She was in love with the sound of her own name and seemed to view my speech impediment as a personal assault. If I wanted to spend the rest of my life as David Thedarith, then so be it. She, however, was going to be called Mi <I>ss</I> Chri <I>ss</I> y <I>S</I> am <I>s</I> on. Had her name included no <I>s</I>'s, she probably would have bypassed a career in therapy and devoted herself to yanking out healthy molars or performing unwanted clitoridectomies on the schoolgirls of Africa. Such was her personality. <P> "Oh, come on," my mother would say. "I'm sure she's not <I>that</I> bad. Give her a break. The girl's just trying to do her job." <P> I was a few minutes early one week and entered the office to find Agent Samson doing her job on Garth Barclay, a slight, kittenish boy I'd met back in the fourth grade. "You may wait out <I>s</I> ide in the hallway until it i <I>s</I> your turn," she told me. A week or two later my session was interrupted by mincing Steve Bixler, who popped his head in the door and announced that his parents were taking him out of town for a long weekend, meaning that he would miss his regular Friday session. "Thorry about that," he said. <P> I started keeping watch over the speech therapy door, taking note of who came and went. Had I seen one popular student leaving the office, I could have believed my mother and viewed my lisp as the sort of thing that might happen to anyone. Unfortunately, I saw no popular students. Chuck Coggins, Sam Shelton, Louis Delucca&#58; obviously, there was some connection between a sibilate <I>s</I> and a complete lack of interest in the State versus Carolina issue. <P> None of the therapy students were girls. They were all boys like me who kept movie star scrapbooks and made their own curtains. "You don't want to be doing that," the men in our families would say. "That's a girl thing." Baking scones and cupcakes for the school janitors, watching <I>Guiding Light</I> with our mothers, collecting rose petals for use in a fragrant potpourri&#58; anything worth doing turned out to be a girl thing. In order to enjoy ourselves, we learned to be duplicitous. Our stacks of <I>Cosmopolitan</I> were topped with an unread issue of <I>Boy's Life </I> or <I>Sports Illustrated,</I> and our decoupage projects were concealed beneath the sporting equipment we never asked for but always received. When asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, we hid the truth and listed who we wanted to sleep with when we grew up. "A policeman or a fireman or one of those guys who works with high-tension wires." Symptoms were feigned, and our mothers wrote notes excusing our absences on the day of the intramural softball tournament. Brian had a stomach virus or Ted suffered from that twenty-four-hour bug that seemed to be going around. <P> One of the <I>s</I> e day <I>s</I> I'm going to have to hang a <I>s</I> ign on that door," Agent Samson used to say. She was probably thinking along the lines of SPEECH THERAPY LAB, though a more appropriate marker would have read FUTURE HOMOSEXUALS OF AMERICA. We knocked ourselves out trying to fit in but were ultimately betrayed by our tongues. At the beginning of the school year, while we were congratulating ourselves on successfully passing for normal, Agent Samson was taking names as our assembled teachers raised their hands, saying, "I've got one in my homeroom," and "There are two in my fourth-period math class." Were they also able to spot the future drunks and depressives? Did they hope that by eliminating our lisps, they might set us on a different path, or were they trying to prepare us for future stage and choral careers? <P> Miss Samson instructed me, when forming an <I>s,</I> to position the tip of my tongue against the rear of my top teeth, right up against the gum line. The effect produced a sound not unlike that of a tire releasing air. It was awkward and strange-sounding, and elicited much more attention than the original lisp. I failed to see the hissy <I>s</I> as a solution to the problem and continued to talk normally, at least at home, where my lazy tongue fell upon equally lazy ears. At school, where every teacher was a potential spy, I tried to avoid an <I>s</I> ound whenever possible. "Yes," became "correct," or a military "affirmative." "Please," became "with your kind permission," and questions were pleaded rather than asked. After a few weeks of what she called "endless pestering" and what I called "repeated badgering," my mother bought me a pocket thesaurus, which provided me with <I>s</I>-free alternatives to just about everything. I consulted the book both at home in my room and at the daily learning academy other people called our school. Agent Samson was not amused when I began referring to her as an articulation coach, but the majority of my teachers were delighted. "What a nice vocabulary," they said. "My goodness, such big words!" <P> Plurals presented a considerable problem, but I worked around them as best I could; "rivers," for example, became either "a river or two" or "many a river." Possessives were a similar headache, and it was easier to say nothing than to announce that the left-hand and the right-hand glove of Janet had fallen to the floor. After all the compliments I had received on my improved vocabulary, it seemed prudent to lie low and keep my mouth shut. I didn't want anyone thinking I was trying to be a pet of the teacher. <P> When I first began my speech therapy, I worried that the Agent Samson plan might work for everyone but me, that the other boys might strengthen their lazy tongues, turn their lives around, and leave me stranded. Luckily my fears were never realized. Despite the woman's best efforts, no one seemed to make any significant improvement. The only difference was that we were all a little quieter. Thanks to Agent Samson's tape recorder, I, along with the others, now had a clear sense of what I actually sounded like. There was the lisp, of course, but more troubling was my voice itself, with its excitable tone and high, girlish pitch. I'd hear myself ordering lunch in the cafeteria, and the sound would turn my stomach. How could anyone stand to listen to me? Whereas those around me might grow up to be lawyers or movie stars, my only option was to take a vow of silence and become a monk. My former classmates would call the abbey, wondering how I was doing, and the priest would answer the phone. "You can't talk to him!" he'd say. "Why, Brother David hasn't spoken to anyone in thirty-five years!" <P> "Oh, relax," my mother said. "Your voice will change eventually." <P> "And what if it doesn't?" <P> She shuddered. "Don't be so morbid." <P> It turned out that Agent Samson was something along the lines of a circuit-court speech therapist. She spent four months at our school and then moved on to another. Our last meeting was held the day before school let out for Christmas. My classrooms were all decorated, the halls &#151; everything but her office, which remained as bare as ever. I was expecting a regular half hour of Sassy the seal and was delighted to find her packing up her tape recorder. <P> "I thought that thi <I>s</I> afternoon we might let loo <I>s</I> e and have a party, you and I. How doe <I>s</I> that <I>s</I> ound?" She reached into her desk drawer and withdrew a festive tin of cookies. "Here, have one. I made them my <I>s</I> elf from <I>s</I> cratch and, boy, was it a me <I>ss</I>! Do you ever make cookie <I>s</I>?" <P> I lied, saying that no, I never had. <P> "Well, it <I>'s</I> hard work," she said. "E <I>s</I> pecially if you don't have a mixer." <P> It was unlike Agent Samson to speak so casually, and awkward to sit in the hot little room, pretending to have a normal conversation. <I>"S</I> o," she said, "what are your plan <I>s</I> for the holiday <I>s</I>?" <P> "Well, I usually remain here and, you know, open a gift from my family." <P> "Only one?" she asked. <P> "Maybe eight or ten." <P> "Never <I>s</I> ix or <I>s</I> even?" <P> "Rarely," I said. <P> "And what do you do on De <I>c</I> ember thirty-fir <I>s</I> t, New Year'<I>s</I> Eve?" <P> "On the final day of the year we take down the pine tree in our living room and eat marine life." <P> "You're pretty good at avoiding those <I>s</I>'s," she said. "I have to hand it to you, you're tougher than most." <P> I thought she would continue trying to trip me up, but instead she talked about her own holiday plans. "It <I>'s</I> pretty hard with my fian <I>c</I> in Vietnam," she said.
