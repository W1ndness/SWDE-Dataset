And now her sins are coming home to haunt her.<p>As Rachel searches for the truth behind a terrifying murder, an even greater menace threatens, for the demon Algaliarept will stop at nothing to claim her, and the discovery of a shocking family secret throws Rachel's entire life into question. If she is ever to live free, Rachel must first walk willingly into the demonic ever-after in search of long-lost ancient knowledge.<p>But when you dance with demons, you lay your soul on the line.... and there are some lines that should never be crossed.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>This sixth offering of outlaw witch turned bounty hunter, Rachel Morgan, offers the typical Harrison yarn filled with some good laughs and the odd thrill to boot. Gigi Birmingham taps into the comedic undertones, be it the sarcasm so common to Morgan's twisted personality or simply the everyday woman aspect of the tale, thereby capturing the character's essence perfectly. As believable as she is as this generally unbelievable character, Birmingham knows exactly when to amp up the tension and captivate the listener. Always entertaining and quite likable in the title role, Birmingham offers a splendid reading of Harrison's eccentric protagonist. <I>Simultaneous release with the Eos hardcover (Reviews, Dec. 3).

											If you love reading about the supernatural, then you will love this series.  It has everything you crave to read about; witches, vampires- live and undead, demons, shapechanges, and even banshes and gargoyles. It is better if you start out with book one because all the books build upon each other.  As soon as I read book one, I had to go out and buy the next couple.  Rachel is a white (good) witch who is trying to stay that way but circumstances keep pushing her to use black magic and get her into trouble.  When things get harry, she doesn't mind using a little black magic as long as she is the only one who gets hurt from it.  If you like this series I would also reccommend the Dresdin Files by Jim Butcher.  You need to start with book one with that series also because they build upon each other.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Another great book by Kim Harrison!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Brittany5704">Brittany5704</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1359483_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780061149825_BK_1_1359483" href="#previewReview_1359483" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>April 15, 2010: 
											I just got into reading the Rachel Morgan series back in February. I absolutely devoured the first seven in a weekend, this one being number six; now a total of eight with the release of the latest book Black Magic Sanction. I would recommend them to anyone (and so far, I have recommended them to nearly everyone). The story line is great, with never a slow moment; a good, quick pace. It continues the story of Rachel Morgan, a witch who runs a runner (and sometimes escort--but not the sex kind) service with a living vampire named Ivy and a pixy named Jenks. (I thought it sounded a little weird too at first--until I started reading.) True to character, Rachel runs into trouble right from the very first chapter, which she spends the remainder of the book trying to get herself out of. Kim Harrison continues to develop her characters in a believable way. What I mean by that is that everything isn't always good and fine. There are equal parts of tragedy and comedy, success and failure. If you decide to read it, make sure to plan some free time because you will have a hard time putting it down. I have re-read the entire series once already and plan to do so again soon. It's rare that I can do that so soon after the first time with any author so that is definitely saying something. I actually already had this one in paper back but I bought it again in hardcover so that I could add it to my permanent library. Already looking forward to the next one!</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/48430000/48433544.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Kim Harrison</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Rock Hill, South Carolina</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A. in the sciences, 1989</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br><I>Romantic Times</I> Award for Best Fantasy Novel for <I>Dead Witch Walking</I>, 2004; P.E.A.R.L.

A biology major in college, she took only the required English courses needed to graduate. So when the writing bug hit her later in life, she found herself at a real disadvantage with grammar, spelling, and other basic weapons in the scribbler's arsenal. However, her love of books was her saving grace. Always a voracious reader, Harrison instinctively recognized the role of plot, pacing, and character development in good storytelling. She set about writing with great enthusiasm and plugged away for the better part of decade, until she was able to bring her skills up to par.<p>    Harrison's debut novel grew out of frustration with a growing pile of rejection notices. In an attempt to get publishers' attention, she set out to craft something deliberately weird and edgy. She conceived a motley cast of vampires, werewolves, pixies, and witches, including a sexy bounty hunter named Rachel Morgan, and threw them together in a short story. Then, her agent introduced her to editor Diana Gill, and together they refined and expanded Harrison's idea into a full length novel.<p>     Published in 2004, <i>Dead Witch Walking</I> became a bestseller, launched a blockbuster series, and catapulted Harrison into a pantheon of paranormal superstars that includes Laurell K. Hamilton, Charlaine Harris, Christine Feehan, and Sherrilyn Kenyon. As if to validate her inclusion in these ranks, Harrison's stories have also been included in several bestselling paranormal collections.<p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><li><strong>Harrison claims that her muse</strong> exists in music. In our exclusive interview, she explained, "Music moves society more than most people realize. In my opinion, it's a soft manipulator of influence and change. I love the power of the musician who composes and performs. I envy their ability to put a nugget of truth in three minutes of sweat and emotional outpouring, colored entirely from their thoughts. And I'll admit that if I can, I'll steal that nugget of truth, study it, facet it, polish it, and place it in my writing."<p>      <li><strong>On her MySpace page,</strong> Kim lists the following as her heroes: "My parents. Anyone who pursues their dreams when no one believes they can reach them. Single moms and dads."<p>    <li><strong>Rachel Morgan and her otherworldly cohorts</strong> exist in and around an alternate version of Cincinnati, Ohio -- a "little big city" Harrison was familiar with from her Midwestern youth. She always tries to incorporate "Cincy" sights into her series novels, so readers are likely to find allusions to Eden Park, the Cincinnati Zoo, and other local neighborhoods and landmarks.<p>    <li><strong>As a tribute to one of her favorite actor/directors,</strong> Harrison has given some of her Rachel Morgan novels titles that play on well-known Clint Eastwood films: <i>For a Few Demons More</I>, <i>Every Which Way but Dead</i>, <i>The Outlaw Demon Wails</I>, etc.<p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2007, Kim Harrison took some time out to answer some of our questions about her favorite books, authors, and life as a writer. </I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  I look back on my reading as I was growing up, and I can see a good handful of authors and series that have impacted my writing, but if I had to pick one title that did the most "damage," I'd have to say that it was <I>Dandelion Wine</I> by Ray Bradbury. I believe I was about ten when I read it first, not understanding as much as I do now, but I knew there was something there, a greater truth of the human condition, if I could only find it. So I kept looking, unknowingly studying Bradbury's pacing, suspense, use of language, and my favorite, how to describe a character in a single paragraph so that the reader instantly knows who that character is on the inside. <p>    It was here that I first saw the power a writer can command when he or she mixes fantasy with the stark honesty of the human condition. The monsters in Bradbury's <I>Dandelion Wine</I> were the monsters inside us, as were the heroes, but that didn't make them any less real -- it made them more so. I fell in love with the fluidity he uses the language with, that the greater truth that can be found in the simplest things. A way of seeing, I suppose. <I>Dandelion Wine</I> became one of the few books that I returned to time and again, and while not anywhere near the story crafter as Mr. Bradbury, I hope I managed to absorb by osmosis some of his techniques.   <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  My ten favorite books are going to look like a history lesson of young adult reading rather than a leather-bound collection of great literature. They are good, solid reads that satisfied my like of adventure and the chance to learn something along the way. Apart from the few children's books in there, most are from the SF/fantasy authors popular in the �70s and early �80s when I was doing most of my reading. I didn't know it at the time, but I think I was studying them, picking the authors' work apart and seeing what worked and what didn't. Some might even be out of print, but they will always remain new-penny bright to me. <p>    <li><I>Zero Stone</I> by Andre Norton -- For the sheer adventure of it all. I wanted a special cat like that, and I wanted to live on a space ship. <p>    <li><I>Have Spacesuit, Will Travel</I> by  Robert A Heinlein -- Again, I wanted to live on a space ship, darn it! But what I came away with was determination. If Kip could get to the moon with a used spacesuit, then I could do anything, and no one would convince me different. <p>    <li><I>Tomorrow's Children Anthology</I> edited by Isaac Asimov. I worked in the school library in my seventh and eighth grade, and I found this way up high in the fiction shelves.  It became my standby book, carried from class to class when I was between series. I don't know if all of the authors in this anthology were well known at the time, but when I got my first writing paycheck, I hunted up a good copy. It was that important to me, and I still remember the stories in it to this day and the way they made me feel. <p>    <li><I>Midnight at the Well of Souls</I> by Jack L Chalker -- I read and reread the entire series for several summers. I though I was just enjoying the ride, but I think I was studying how he built a society so fast and carry a story from book to book. I came away wondering if tragic characters who aren't loveable are more interesting than those who are. <p>    <li><I>Lord Fouls Bane</I> by Stephen Donaldson which is book one of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. And when I read this one, I knew tragic, flawed characters are more fascinating than honorable ones. You either pity Thomas or you hate him. I did both. <p>    <li><I>Dragon Song</I> was my entry drug to Anne McCaffery, whom I absorbed, envying her ability to tell a story from a character's viewpoint. I wanted a fire lizard so bad! Still do. <p>    <li><I>Tales from the Storyteller's House</I> by Thornton W. Burgess -- Another book that probably shaped me more than I realized, where animals talked and morals were put in simple terms, with no right or wrong, but just -- according to the harsh rules of mother nature. <p>    <li><I>Arty the Smarty</I> by Faith McNulty -- This is the first book I remember reading by myself, and it is about a little fish that swam contrary to everyone else and made a big splash in the world. I doubt very much my mother knew the impact of this one had on me, but maybe this was why I tried to do everything different from everyone else. <p>    <li><I>The Velveteen Rabbit</I> by Margery Williams -- One of my favorites with a place of honor on my mantel, because magic is real and things we love will be alive forever. <p>    <li><I>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</I> by Richard Bach -- Because he was a teacher willing to teach those who would listen, forever a student on his own road, and no one would stop him. Ever. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  As the reader has probably guessed, I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's movies. I've not seen them all by any means, but my favorite is probably <I>Pale Rider</I> or <I>Heartbreak Ridge</I>. I've often seen my protagonist like some of the characters that Clint played in his spaghetti westerns, the loaner who comes into town with the ability to wipe out the corruption, but not always eager to do it, and when pressured into it, doesn't always take care of business lawfully but with justice. <p>    Some of my other favorite films are:<p>    <li><I>The Sixth Sense</I>, because I didn't figure it out until the exact moment that the director wanted me to, right along with the main character. Beautifully done, and I envy that ability. <p>    <li><I>Die Hard</I> -- For the action and the character Bruce plays. <p>    <li><I>Blade Runner</I> -- And no, this is not where Rachel got her name. I love the atmosphere, if you will.  It's visual poetry. It's one of the few that I will drop everything to watch when I find it on TV. <p>    <li><I>High Spirits</I> -- Because I love to laugh, and I like happy endings. It's just good fun. Favorite line -- and I'm sorry, I've mangled it: "Why are large chunks of masonry floating about?" I mean, what's not to love? <p>    <li><I>2010</I> -- If only for that once scene where Roy huddles with that young woman during the air-brake around Jupiter.  Two people who don't know each other, can't even communicate, stripped down to their basic humanity in fear, and they come together to support each other.  Maybe you had to grow up during the Cold War to appreciate it, but the entire movie had everything I like, even that happy ending. <p>    <li><I>Memoirs of a Geisha</I> and <i>The Last Samurai</I> -- For the majesty, nobility, and beauty lost. Because I like sad endings, too. <p>    <li><I>Ocean's Eleven</I> -- Because I really like smart. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  Music oftentimes inspires my writing, or at least my characters and the direction they take. I've found that when I'm having trouble solidifying a character or a scene, that music will often free my subconscious just that last little bit to allow me to move forward, and often it's in a direction that I didn't expect, but is 100 percent true to the character. Alternate rock seems to be my favorite for the themes in the lyrics and the sound, rich in variety, though slow jazz will slip in on a rainy day, and electronic dance will get me through an action scene before I realize the day has slipped away. <p>    I don't always listen while I work, but when I do, I tend to focus on certain bands that reflect the Hollows or the characters. NIN is good for working with Ivy or Rachel for the frustrated, in-your-face attitude. Rachel is pure Garbage with a little Evanescence thrown in for the themes focusing on the tragedy of the individual arising from our own choices. Evanescence is Ivy as well, with the attention given to manipulation, great for vampires. When I'm stuck on a scene with my two leading ladies, it's Amy Lee all day. A Perfect Circle is another group that really brings vampires to my mind. <p>    When I brought to the readers the connections that I made between the characters and certain songs, they responded with such a plethora of ideas that I had to devote a portion of my web site, www.kimharrison.net, to cataloging them. Their ideas have expanded my music tastes dramatically, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that lots of people can see the characters in music as I do. <p>      <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  If I give a book as a gift, it is invariably a children's book with beautiful artwork and a simple text.  I adore the feel of them, the care taken in the artwork, and the high visual stimulation that sets off the simple but often powerful message the text conveys. You can't read a book like that fast, the experience slowed down as you study the artwork as the sentence or two sinks in. I'm lucky that my mother loves books like these as much as I do, and it's probably from her that my appreciation comes from. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I recently moved my office space from a three-by-five area against my kitchen wall to a real office with windows and a door, and I am enjoying it so much it's almost not fair. I have made a point to not develop a ritual so I could sit down at any point in my day and begin -- preventing a 30-minute warm-up -- but alas, a ritual has found me, involving spending the first hour of my day responding to my readers, loosening up my fingers, and slamming down my first cup of chai tea.      That never-ending mug of chai tea is a must, and it is with me from the moment I sit down to when I push back at the end of the day and wobble out of my office. I have a salt lamp that I light to ionize the air when I know it's going to be an intense day, and I've got my iPod that I will sometimes program and loop to keep the mood flowing and the passing of hours unnoticed. Oh, and I have a four-legged office assistant that keeps my feet warm and gets me outside three times a day.  <p>      <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  Someone told me that it takes ten years' hard work to become an overnight success, and I fully believe it. I've been writing for at least that long, stashing manuscripts under my bed and a filling a file with short stories that will never see the light of day. I collected my share of rejection slips along the way, and actually, I threw all but two out while moving my office. It felt really, really good to throw the others away. I mean, really good, like I had finally made it and I was never going back. I have since framed and hung the two I kept as a constant reminder of where I started and how fragile the journey was to get where I am now. <p>    I kept my first rejection letter as a reminder of how crushed I felt when I received it, and the surge of blind determination that followed that this one person was not going to tell me what I could and couldn't do. The other letter I kept is a query as to the availability of <I>Dead Witch Walking</I> (which was in production at the time in another house).  I put this one on my wall as a reminder to take everyone seriously, because you'll never know what you'll pass up if you don't. <p>    I never considered I might make a career out of writing as I was going to school, so when I did turn my attentions that way, I was very ill prepared, having only what I read as a guide, and no formal training whatsoever.  I credit that very ignorance with a great deal of my success. My voice was my own from day one, my ideas on how to get from point A to point B were my own -- they were pathetically rough, but they were my own.  I had to work extremely hard to catch up with grammar and spelling, but I fell in love with the process and kept at it until my skills started to equal my enthusiasm.  Most importantly, I never considered that I wouldn't make it. Ignorance is bliss sometimes. If I had known how hard it would be, I might have given up. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I have two pieces of advice that I give out to writers looking for publication. The first is to write like you have the contract. Which by, I mean, intently and with purpose.  If you want to be a writer, BE A WRITER. Sit down and write, don't make a game out of it, but treat it as a part-time job. You will never be a writer if you don't first start acting like it. You don't need an office. You don't need a fancy printer or huge chunks of time. Don't fall into the trap of having to have everything perfect to write or wait until the mood strikes you. If you want it as a job, treat it like a job, and just as you don't go to work only when you feel like it, you have to condition yourself to sit and write even when the ideas don't flow. Ah, having said that, don't quit your day job. I was lucky to have someone to support me and supplement my part-time day job while I was building my skills, but a page a day will get you a completed manuscript in a year's time. <p>    My second suggestion would be to get into a face-to-face, functioning critique group. The reasons are twofold. First, publication is a hard path to follow, and friends who can relate will make it easier. Secondly, there's bound to be a published author there, and they can start to open doors for you. I credit my old writers' critique group with me finding publication so "fast."  They helped me learn what is good advice, and what is bad. I learned confidence in my ideas and my skills, I polished my voice, and my style. And when I was ready, someone shoved my little introverted butt in front of the man who eventually became my agent. And yes, she literally dragged me over there.  <p>    Which brings me to the shy people. Don't worry about it. If you truly love your work, you can do <I>anything</I>. Trust me on this. Your enthusiasm will pour out, and you will be heard.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P> To save the lives of her friends, Rachel did the unthinkable&#58; she willingly trafficked in forbidden demon magic.

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>This sixth offering of outlaw witch turned bounty hunter, Rachel Morgan, offers the typical Harrison yarn filled with some good laughs and the odd thrill to boot. Gigi Birmingham taps into the comedic undertones, be it the sarcasm so common to Morgan's twisted personality or simply the everyday woman aspect of the tale, thereby capturing the character's essence perfectly. As believable as she is as this generally unbelievable character, Birmingham knows exactly when to amp up the tension and captivate the listener. Always entertaining and quite likable in the title role, Birmingham offers a splendid reading of Harrison's eccentric protagonist. <I>Simultaneous release with the Eos hardcover (Reviews, Dec. 3).

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>This sixth entry in Harrison's popular Rachel Morgan series (<i>For a Few Demons More</i>) finds the witch/bounty hunter battling demons both figuratively and literally. Someone's been summoning the demon Algaliarept (you can call him Al) in an attempt to kill Rachel; and Rachel's trying to figure out who murdered her vampire boyfriend, Kisten. As Rachel closes in on a solution, she finds that the situation is more complex than she imagined. She also discovers that she has powers unusual for a witch, which leads her to question how the genetic cure she received as a child has shaped her powers as an adult. Though Harrison focuses more on the inner lives of her series characters here than in earlier books, there's still plenty of action, especially in the novel's last half when Rachel must use her magical skills and her intellect to extricate herself from yet another impossible situation. This is the strongest entry in the series so far, and based on the loose ends left at the book's conclusion, there's more of Rachel's story left to tell. Highly recommended for all libraries where urban fantasy is popular. [See Prepub Alert, <i>LJ</i>11/15/07.]-Nanette Donohue, Champaign P.L., IL</P></ARTICLE><ARTICLE LANGUAGE="EN" SECRIGHTS="YES" PUBLICATION="Library Journal"</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Harrison (For A Few Demons More, 2007, etc.) wraps up a story arc but promises more to come in this sixth volume of a series set in a future Cincinnati. Most humans have been exterminated by a rogue virus, allowing witches, vampires, elves and other nonhuman creatures to come out of hiding and live among the survivors. Among the witches is bounty hunter Rachel Morgan, and she's in trouble again. The demon Al, supposedly imprisoned in the ever-after, is being summoned from his confinement each sundown, allowing him to seek revenge on the person who got him locked up-i.e., Rachel. While evading Al and searching for his summoner, she refuses a hazardous assignment from corrupt elven politician Trent, who's tried to kill her in the past. As these plot lines converge, Rachel is forced to not only accept, but to exploit some unpleasant, newly learned truths about herself. Meanwhile, she continues to mourn the death of her boyfriend Kisten and struggles to remember the terrible circumstances of his murder. She must also resolve her tension-filled relationship with vampire roommate Ivy, decide what to do about Marshal (a potential new boyfriend) and address concerns about her emotionally unstable mother. It all might sound like a soap opera, but Harrison makes Rachel's conflicts real and poignant without turning them into melodramatic slush. So it doesn't matter too much that her current adventure is highly dependent on back story and can't really stand on its own. Not for those new to the series, but Harrison devotees should find ample emotional revelations and plot resolution, with enough loose ends to have them eagerly awaiting the next installment.

The ends of my scarf slipped to block my view, and I tucked them behind my short leather jacket. I had no call to be looking at wands. I didn't have the money, but more important, I wasn't shopping for business today&#8212;I was shopping for pleasure. </p>  <p> "Rachel?" my mom said from halfway across the store, smiling as she fingered a display of packaged organic herbs. "How about Dorothy? Make Jenks hairy, and he could be Toto." </p>  <p> "No friggin' way!" Jenks exclaimed, and I started when the pixy took off from my shoulder where he'd been nestled in my scarf&#8201;'s warmth. Gold dust sifted from him to make a temporary sunbeam on the counter and brighten the drab evening. "I'm not going to spend Halloween handing out candy as a dog! And no Wendy and Tinker Bell either. I'm going as a pirate!" His wings slowed as he settled atop the counter next to the stand of low-grade redwood dowels suitable for amulets. "Coordinating costumes is stupid." </p>  <p> Normally I'd agree, but, silent, I drew back from the counter. I'd never have enough disposable income for a wand. Besides, versatility was key in my profession, and wands were one-spell wonders. "I'm going as the female lead in the latest vampire flick," I said to my mom. "The one where the vampire hunter falls in love with the vamp?" </p>  <p> "You're going as a vampire hunter?" my mother asked. </p>  <p> Warming, I plucked an uninvoked amulet from a vanity rack to size my chest up. I was hippy enough to pass for the actress Iwas trying to mimic, but my excuse of a chest wouldn't match her spell-enhanced bust. And it had to be spell enhanced. Naturally big-chested women don't run like that. "No, the vampire," I said, embarrassed. Ivy, my housemate, was going as the hunter, and despite my agreement that coordinating costumes was stupid, I knew Ivy and I would stop conversation when we walked into the party. And that was the point, wasn't it? Halloween was the only time doppelg&#228;nger charms were legal&#8212;and Inderland and the braver slice of humanity made the most of it. </p>  <p> My mother's face went serious, then cleared. "Oh! The black-haired one, right? In the slut outfit? Good God, I don't know if my sewing machine can go through leather." </p>  <p> "Mom!" I protested, though used to her language and lack of tact. If it came into her head, it came out of her mouth. I glanced at the clerk with her, but she clearly knew my mother and wasn't fazed. Seeing a woman in tasteful slacks and an angora sweater swearing like a sailor tended to throw people off. Besides, I already had the outfit in my closet. </p>  <p> Frowning, my mother fingered the charms to change hair color. "Come over here, honey. Let's see if they have anything that will touch your curls. Honestly, Rachel. You pick the hardest costumes. Why can't you ever be anything easy, like a troll or fairy princess?" </p>  <p> Jenks snickered. "&#8201;'Cause that's not slutty enough," he said loud enough for me to hear, but not my mother. </p>  <p> I gave him a look, and he simpered as he hovered backward to a rack of seeds. Though only about four inches tall, he cut an attractive figure with his soft-soled boots and the red scarf Matalina, his wife, had knitted him wrapped about his neck. Last spring, I'd used a demon curse to make him human-size, and the memory of his eighteen-year-old, athletic figure, with its trim waist and broad, muscular shoulders made strong from his dragonfly-like wings, was still very much in my memory. He was a very married pixy, but perfection deserved attention. </p>  <p> Jenks made a darting path over my basket, and a package of fern seed for Matalina's wing aches thumped in. Catching sight of the bust enhancer, his expression turned positively devilish. "Speaking of slutty&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;." he started. </p>  <p> "Well-endowed doesn't equal slutty, Jenks," I said. "Grow up. It's for the costume." </p>  <p> "Like that'll do anything?" His grin was infuriating, and his hands were on his hips in his best Peter Pan pose. "You need two or three to even make an impression. Fried eggs." </p>  <p> "Shut up!" </p>  <p> From across the store came my mother's oblivious "Solid black, right?" I turned to see her hair color shifting as she touched the invoked sample amulets. Her hair was exactly like mine. Sort of. I kept mine long, the wild, frizzy red just past my shoulders, instead of in the close cut she used to tame hers. But our eyes were the same green, and I had her same skill in earth magic, fleshed out and given a professional stamp at one of the local colleges. She had more education than I did, actually, but had few opportunities to use it. Halloween had always been a chance for her to show off her considerable earth magic skills to the neighboring moms with a modest vengeance, and I think she appreciated me asking for her help this year. She had been doing great these last few months, and I couldn't help but wonder if she was doing better because I was spending more time with her, or if she simply appeared more stable because I wasn't seeing her just when she was having problems. </p>  <p> Guilt slithered through me, and giving Jenks a glare at his song about big-busted ladies tying their shoes, I wove through the stands of herbs and racks sporting premade charms, each having a distinctive sticker identifying who had made it. Charm crafting was still a cottage industry despite the high level of technology available to smooth out the rough spots, but one tightly regulated and vigorously licensed. The owner of the store probably only crafted a few of the spells she sold. </p>   <I><b>The Outlaw Demon Wails</b></I>. Copyright � by Kim Harrison.
