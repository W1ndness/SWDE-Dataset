<p>
Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a good job, loyal friends, even a waterfront home in small-town North Carolina. In full pursuit of the good life-- boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddies--he holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him . . . and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesn't help. Despite himself, Travis can't stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen. Spanning the eventful years of young love, marriage and family, <i>The Choice</i> ultimately confronts us with the most heart wrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?<p>

											This was by far one of my 2 favorite books from Nicholas Sparks!!  The story of Gabby and Travis is so touching because the whole time you feel their true love for each other.  And when their tragedy is revealed, it was so easy to put myself in the shoes of Travis and the decision he had to endure.  A definate permanant book in my library to read over and over and over when I need something to kill time.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/42120000/42127981.JPG" alt="" height="153" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Nicholas Sparks</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>New Bern, North Carolina</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>December 31, 1965</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Omaha, Nebraska</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A. in finance, University of Notre Dame, 1988</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://nicholassparks.com">* Nicholas Sparks's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Ever since <i>The Notebook</i> made Nicholas Sparks a word-of-mouth publishing sensation in 1996, he has maintained his status as a bestselling author of tragedy-tinged love stories. His spare, simply themed novels star ordinary people overcome by extraordinary emotions, and changed by them. <P>  It's possible that Sparks might have enjoyed his level of popularity by writing these stories strictly from imagination, but in fact his family's struggles play an important role in many of his books, especially the earliest novels. (For example<i>The Notebook</i>, his tale of a great love affair extending into old age, was inspired by his wife's grandparents; <i>Message in a Bottle</i> drew from Sparks' father's life story and <i>A Walk to Remember</i> from his late sister's.) In addition, a three-week trip he and his older sibling Micah undertook in 2003 became the basis for <I>Three Weeks with My Brother</I>, a unique memoir as moving and tenderhearted as any of his fiction.    <P>  Sparks is very methodical about his writing, an approach he makes transparent on his web site with several essays, updates on works in progress, and notes on the mechanics of his novels. Unsurprisingly, critics have faulted him for being too formulaic or cliched. Still, Sparks never fails to move his stories along quickly, maximizing emotional impact and featuring strong, down-to-earth characters. His endings also tend to depart from convention a bit, revealing tragedy where the walk into the sunset should be.   <P>Although he is often classified as a Romance writer, Sparks is quick to point out that his books don't really satisfy the requirements of Romance publishers. Instead, he admits to writing love stories, a different genre altogether. Whatever he cares to call them, one thing's for sure: Nicholas Sparks continues to strike gold with his bittersweet novels of love and loss.</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Sparks came to his career</b> in an unconventional way: Sidelined after a running injury at University of Notre Dame, where he had won a full track scholarship and still holds the 4x800 relay record, he decided to write a book after his mother offhandedly suggested it as a way to make him stop brooding. His first novel remains unpublished ("It's a wonderful story -- except for the writing," he wrote later), but he kept trying. He later coauthored an inspirational title called <i>Wokini</i>; but his third novel (<i>The Notebook</i>) was the charm. <p>    <b> Blockbuster film adaptations</b> of <i>Message in a Bottle</i>, <i>A Walk to Remember</i>, and <i>The Notebook</I> have turned Sparks into a successful Hollywood franchise.<p>    <b>Sparks' wife</b> is probably one of the most envied wives around. She met Nicholas in college at spring break, where he informed her that they would be married. She laughed him off, but they were married just over a year later. He told Barnes & Noble.com in a 1999 interview, "I suppose I'm a romantic. <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> has even called me the Most Romantic Husband in America. In fact, I sent my wife a dozen roses today."<p>    <b>Sparks was still selling</b> pharmaceuticals and had only just delivered the final version of <i>The Notebook</i> to his agent when she called, two days after receiving the manuscript, telling him she expected "something big." That something big materialized within the week: a $1 million offer from Warner Books.<p>    <b>Sparks holds a  black belt</b> in Tae Kwon Do.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Sometimes, we make choices we didn't choose to make. Travis Parker, for example, wasn't looking for a relationship; from his perspective, his life was pretty close to perfect. And new neighbor Gabby Holland wasn't exactly dating material. This attractive redhead had a longtime steady boyfriend and treated Travis like an unwanted guest. But the unexpected can reshape our lives, shredding every well-laid plan into wedding confetti... Another masterfully nuanced relationship novel from Nicholas Sparks.

Matt, red-faced  and grunting, continued to push the spa toward the recently cut  square at the far edge of the deck. His feet slipped, and he could  feel sweat pouring from his forehead into the corners of his eyes,  making them sting. It was hot, way too hot for early May. Too damn  hot for this, that's for sure. Even Travis's dog, Moby, was hiding  in the shade and panting, his tongue hanging out.  <p>  Travis Parker, who was pushing the massive box alongside him,  managed to shrug. "Because you thought it would be fun," he said. He  lowered his shoulder and shoved; the spa-which must have weighed  four hundred pounds-moved another couple of inches. At this rate,  the spa should be in place, oh ... sometime next week.  <p>  "This is ridiculous," Matt said, heaving his weight into the box,  thinking that what they really needed was a team of mules. His back  was killing him. For a moment, he visualized his ears blowing off  the sides of his head from the strain, shooting in both directions  like the bottle rockets he and Travis used to launch as kids.  <p>  "You've already said that."  <p>  "And it isn't fun," Matt grunted.  <p>  "You said that,too."  <p>  "And it isn't going to be easy to install."  <p>  "Sure it is," Travis said. He stood and pointed to the lettering on  the box. "See? It says right here, 'Easy to Install.'" From his spot  beneath the shady tree, Moby-a purebred boxer-barked as if in  agreement, and Travis smiled, looking way too pleased with himself.  <p>  Matt scowled, trying to catch his breath. He hated that look. Well,  not always. Most of the time he enjoyed his friend's boundless  enthusiasm. But not today. Definitely not today.  <p>  Matt reached for the bandanna in his rear pocket. It was soaked with  sweat, which had of course done wonders for the seat of his pants.  He wiped his face and wrung the bandanna with a quick twist. Sweat  dribbled from it like a leaky faucet onto the top of his shoe. He  stared at it almost hypnotically, before feeling it soak through the  light mesh fabric, giving his toes a nice, slimy feel. Oh, that was  just dandy, wasn't it?  <p>  "As I recall, you said Joe and Laird would be here to help us with  your 'little project' and that Megan and Allison would cook some  burgers and we'd have beer, and that-oh yeah, installing this thing  should only take a couple of hours at the most."  <p>  "They're coming," Travis said.  <p>  "You said that four hours ago."  <p>  "They must be running a little late."  <p>  "Maybe you never called them at all."  <p>  "Of course I called them. And they're bringing the kids, too. I  promise."  <p>  "When?"  <p>  "Soon."  <p>  "<i>Uh-huh</i>," Matt answered. He stuffed the bandanna back in his pocket.  "And by the way-assuming they don't arrive soon, just how on earth  do you think the two of us will be able to lower this thing into  place?"  <p> Travis dismissed the problem with a wave as he turned toward the box  again. "We'll figure it out. Just think how well we've done so far.  We're almost halfway there."  <p>  Matt scowled again. It was Saturday-Saturday! His day of recreation  and relaxation, his chance to escape from the grindstone, the break  he <i>earned</i> after five days at the bank, the kind of day he <i>needed</i>. He  was a loan officer, for God's sake! He was supposed to push paper,  not hot tubs! He could have been watching the Braves play the  Dodgers! He could have been golfing! He could have gone to the  beach! He could have slept in with Liz before heading to her  parents' house like they did almost every Saturday, instead of  waking at the crack of dawn and performing manual labor for eight  straight hours beneath a scalding southern sun....  <p>  He paused. Who was he kidding? Had he not been here, he would have  definitely spent the day with Liz's parents, which was, in all  honesty, the main reason he'd agreed to Travis's request in the  first place. But that wasn't the point. The point was, he didn't  need this. He really didn't.  <p>  "I don't need this," he said. "I really don't."  <p>  Travis didn't seem to hear him. His hands were already on the box,  and he was getting into position. "You ready?"  <p>  Matt lowered his shoulder, feeling bitter. His legs were shaking.  Shaking! He already knew he'd be in serious, double-dose-of- Advil  pain in the morning. Unlike Travis, he didn't make it into the gym  four days a week or play racquetball or go running or go scuba  diving in Aruba or surfing in Bali or skiing in Vail or anything  else the guy did. "This isn't fun, you know?"  <p>  Travis winked. "You said that already, remember?"  <p>  <p>  "Wow!" Joe commented, lifting an eyebrow as he walked the perimeter  of the hot tub. By then, the sun was beginning its descent, streams  of gold reflecting off the bay. In the distance, a heron broke from  the trees and gracefully skimmed the surface, dispersing the light.  Joe and Megan, along with Laird and Allison, had arrived a few  minutes before with kids in tow, and Travis was showing them around.  "This looks great! You two did all of this today?"  <p>  Travis nodded, holding his beer. "It wasn't so bad," he said. "I  think Matt even enjoyed it."  <p>  Joe glanced at Matt, who lay flattened in a lawn chair off to the  side of the deck, a cold rag over his head. Even his belly-Matt had  always been on the pudgy side-seemed to sag.  <p>  "I can see that."  <p>  "Was it heavy?"  <p>  "Like an Egyptian sarcophagus!" Matt croaked. "One of those gold  ones that only cranes can move!"  <p>  Joe laughed. "Can the kids get in?"  <p>  "Not yet. I just filled it, and the water will take a little while  to heat up. The sun will help, though."  <p>  "The sun will heat it within minutes!" Matt moaned. "Within  seconds!"  <p>  Joe grinned. Laird and the three of them had gone to school together  since kindergarten.  <p>  "Tough day, Matt?"  <p>  Matt removed the rag and scowled at Joe. "You have no idea. And  thanks for showing up on time."  <p>  "Travis said to be here at five. If I had known you needed help, I  would have come earlier."  <p>  Matt slowly shifted his gaze to Travis. He really hated his friend  sometimes.  <p>  "How's Tina doing?" Travis said, changing the subject. "Is Megan  getting any sleep?"  <p>  Megan was chatting with Allison at the table on the far end of the  deck, and Joe glanced briefly in her direction. "Some. Tina's cough  is gone and she's been able to sleep through the night again, but  sometimes I just think that Megan isn't wired to sleep. At least,  not since she became a mom. She gets up even if Tina hasn't made a  peep. It's like the quiet wakes her up."  <p>  "She's a good mom," Travis said. "She always has been."  <p>  Joe turned to Matt. "Where's Liz?" he asked.  <p>  "She should be here any minute," Matt answered, his voice floating  up as if from the dead. "She spent the day with her parents."  "Lovely," Joe commented.  <p>  "Be nice. They're good people."  <p>  "I seem to recall you saying that if you had to sit through one more  of your father-in-law's stories about his prostate cancer or listen  to your mother-in-law fret about Henry getting fired again- even  though it wasn't his fault-you were going to stick your head in the  oven."  <p>  Matt struggled to sit up. "I never said that!"  <p>  "Yes, you did." Joe winked as Matt's wife, Liz, rounded the corner  of the house with Ben toddling just in front of her. "But don't  worry. I won't say a word."  <p>  Matt's eyes darted nervously from Liz to Joe and back again,  checking to see if she'd heard.  <p>  "Hey, y'all!" Liz called out with a friendly wave, leading little  Ben by the hand. She made a beeline for Megan and Allison. Ben broke  away and toddled toward the other kids in the yard.  <p>  Joe saw Matt sigh in relief. He grinned and lowered his voice. "So ...   Matt's in-laws. Is that how you conned him into coming here?"  <p>  "I might have mentioned it," Travis smirked.  <p>  Joe laughed.  <p>  "What are you guys saying?" Matt called out suspiciously.  <p> "Nothing," they said in unison.  <p>  <p>  Later, with the sun down and the food eaten, Moby curled up at  Travis's feet. As he listened to the sound of the kids splashing  away in the spa, Travis felt a wave of satisfaction wash over him.  This was his favorite kind of evening, whiled away to the sound of  shared laughter and familiar banter. One minute Allison was talking  to Joe; the next minute she was chatting with Liz and then Laird or  Matt; and so on for everyone seated around the outdoor table. No  pretenses, no attempts to impress, no one trying to show anyone up.  His life, he sometimes thought, resembled a beer commercial, and for  the most part, he was content simply to ride the current of good  feeling.  <p>  Every now and then, one of the wives would get up to check on the  kids. Laird, Joe, and Matt, on the other hand, reserved their  child-rearing duties at times like these to periodically raising  their voices in hopes of calming down the kids or preventing them  from teasing or accidentally hurting one another. Sure, one of the  kids would throw a tantrum now and then, but most problems were  solved with a quick kiss on a scraped knee or a hug that was as  tender to watch from a distance as it must have been for the kid to  receive.  <p>  Travis looked around the table, pleased that his childhood friends  not only had become good husbands and fathers, but were still a part  of his life. It didn't always turn out that way. At thirty-two, he  knew that life was sometimes a gamble, and he'd survived more than  his share of accidents and falls, some of which should have  inflicted far more serious bodily injury than they had. But it  wasn't just that. Life was unpredictable. Others he'd known growing  up had already died in car accidents, been married and divorced,  found themselves addicted to drugs or booze, or simply moved away  from this tiny town, their faces already blurring in his memory.  What were the odds that the four of them-who'd known one another  since kindergarten-would find themselves in their early thirties  still spending weekends together? Pretty small, he thought. But  somehow, after hanging together through all the adolescent acne and  girl troubles and pressure from their parents, then heading off to  four different colleges with differing career goals, they had each,  one by one, moved back here to Beaufort. They were more like family  than friends, right down to coded expressions and shared experiences  that no outsiders could ever fully understand.  <p>  And miraculously, the wives got along, too. They'd come from  different backgrounds and different parts of the state, but  marriage, motherhood, and the endless gossip of small-town America  were more than enough to keep them chatting regularly on the phone  and bonding like long-lost sisters. Laird had been the first to  marry-he and Allison had tied the knot the summer after they  graduated from Wake Forest; Joe and Megan walked the aisle a year  later, after falling in love during their senior year at North  Carolina. Matt, who'd gone to Duke, met Liz here in Beaufort, and  they were married a year after that. Travis had been the best man in  all three weddings.  <p>  Some things had changed in the past few years, of course, largely  because of the new additions to the families. Laird wasn't always  available to go mountain biking, Joe couldn't join Travis on the  spur of the moment to go skiing in Colorado as he used to, and Matt  had all but given up trying to keep up with him on most things. But  that was okay. They were all still available enough, and among the  three of them-and with enough planning-he was still able to make the  most of his weekends.  <p>  Lost in thought, Travis hadn't realized that the conversation had  lapsed.  <p>  "Did I miss something?"  <p>  "I asked if you'd talked to Monica lately," Megan said, her tone  letting Travis know he was in trouble. All six of them, he thought,  took a bit too much interest in his love life. The trouble with  married people was that they seemed to believe that everyone they  knew should get married. Every woman Travis dated was thus subjected  to subtle, though unyielding, evaluation, especially by Megan. She  was usually the ringleader at moments like these, always trying to  figure out what made Travis tick when it came to women. And Travis,  of course, loved nothing more than to push her buttons in return.  <p>  "Not recently," he said.  <p>  "Why not? She's nice."  <p>  She's also more than a little neurotic, Travis thought. But that was  beside the point.  <p>  "She broke up with me, remember?"  <p>  "So? It doesn't mean she doesn't want you to call."  <p>  "I thought that's exactly what it meant."  <p>  Megan, along with Allison and Liz, stared at him as if he were just  plain dense. The guys, as usual, seemed to be enjoying this. It was  a regular feature of their evenings.  <p>  "But you were fighting, right?"  <p>  So?"  <p>  "Did you ever think she might have simply broken up with you because  she was angry?"  <p>  "I was angry, too."  <p>  "Why?"  <p>  "She wanted me to see a therapist."  <p>  "And let me guess-you said you didn't need to see one."  <p>  "The day I need to see a therapist is the day you see me hike up my  skirt and crochet some mittens."  <p>  Joe and Laird laughed, but Megan's eyebrows shot up. Megan, they all  knew, watched Oprah nearly every day.  <p>  "You don't think men need therapy?"  <p>  "I know I don't."  <p>  "But generally speaking?"  <p>  "Since I'm not a general, I really couldn't say."  <p>  Megan leaned back in her chair. "I think Monica might be on to  something. If you ask me, I think you have commitment issues."  <p>  "Then I'll make sure not to ask you."  <p>  Megan leaned forward. "What's the longest you've ever dated someone?  Two months? Four months?"  <p>  Travis pondered the question. "I dated Olivia for almost a year."  <p>  "I don't think she's talking about high school," Laird cracked.  Occasionally, his friends enjoyed throwing him under the bus, so to  speak.  <p>  "Thanks, Laird," Travis said.  <p>  "What are friends for?"  <p>  "You're changing the subject," Megan reminded him.  <p>  Travis drummed his fingers on his leg. "I guess I'd have to say ...   I can't remember."  <p>  "In other words, not long enough to remember?"  <p>  "What can I say? I've yet to meet any woman who could measure up to  any of you."  <p>  Despite the growing darkness, he could tell she was pleased by his  words. He'd learned long ago that flattery was his best defense at  moments like these, especially since it was usually sincere. Megan,  Liz, and Allison were terrific. All heart and loyalty and generous  common sense.  <p>  "Well, just so you know, I like her," she said.  <p>  "Yeah, but you like everyone I date."  <p>  "No, I don't. I didn't like Leslie."  <p>  None of the wives had liked Leslie. Matt, Laird, and Joe, on the  other hand, hadn't minded her company at all, especially when she  wore her bikini. She was definitely a beauty, and while she wasn't  the type he'd ever marry, they'd had a lot of fun while it lasted.  <p>  "I'm just saying that I think you should give her a call," she  persisted.  <p>  "I'll think about it," he said, knowing he wouldn't. He rose from  the table, angling for an escape. "Anyone need another beer?"  <p>  Joe and Laird lifted their bottles in unison; the others shook their  heads. Travis started for the cooler before hesitating near the  sliding glass door of his house. He darted inside and changed the  CD, listening to the strains of new music filtering out over the  yard as he brought the beers back to the table. By then, Megan,  Allison, and Liz were already chatting about Gwen, the woman who did  their hair. Gwen always had good stories, many of which concerned  the illicit predilections of the town's citizens.  <p>  Travis nursed his beer silently, looking out over the water.  <p>  "What are you thinking about?" Laird asked.  <p>  "It's not important."  <p>  "What is it?"  <p>  Travis turned toward him. "Did you ever notice how some colors are  used for people's names but others aren't?"  <p>  "What are you talking about?"  <p>  "White and Black. Like Mr. White, the guy who owns the tire store.  And Mr. Black, our third-grade teacher. Or even Mr. Green from the  game Clue. But you never hear of someone named Mr. Orange or Mr.  Yellow. It's like some colors make good names, but other colors just  sound stupid. You know what I mean?"  <p>  "I can't say I've ever thought about it."  <p>  "Me neither. Not until just a minute ago, I mean. But it's kind of  strange, isn't it?"  <p>  "Sure," Laird finally agreed.  <p>  Both men were quiet for a moment. "I told you it wasn't important."  <p>  "Yes, you did."  <p>  "Was I right?"  <p>  "Yep."  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>The Choice</b> by <b>Nicholas Sparks</b>  Copyright &copy 2007   by Nicholas Sparks.
