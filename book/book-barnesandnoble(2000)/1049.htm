Newly single, Toots is ready to taste life again, and fate has just handed her the perfect opportunity.<P>The owner of the gossip rag where Toots&rsquo;s daughter works is about to lose the paper to his gambling debts. Eager to find a way to keep her daughter employed among the movers and shakers of Hollywood, Toots calls on her three trusted friends &mdash; Sophie, Mavis, and Ida &mdash; to help her pull some strings. Together, they&rsquo;ll hatch a plan that promises thrills, laughter, and more than a hint of danger. Putting aside her widow&rsquo;s weeds (black was never her color), Toots will prove that you should never underestimate a Southern lady of a certain age, and that each day can be a gift, if you&rsquo;re willing to claim it&hellip;</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Michaels (Mr. & Miss Anonymous) launches the Godmother series, pure recession-proof fun starring a multimillionaire diva and her three best friends. Teresa Amelia &ldquo;Toots&rdquo; Loudenberry, 65, has just buried her eighth husband in Charleston, S.C. Fabulously wealthy, Toots zips through a one-week mourning period and persuades her best friends&mdash;obsessive-compulsive Ida, overweight Mavis (plus Coco, her Chihuahua) and too-thin smoker Sophie&mdash;to come visit and accompany her to Hollywood. Toots is going to secretly buy the Informer, the ailing tabloid that she shamelessly adores and where her reporter daughter Abby Simpson works. But the $10,000,000 transaction hits a snag when Rodwell Archibald Godfrey III, the greedy publisher, absconds with the money to the Cayman Islands. Veteran Michaels, a Golden Girl&ndash;style humorist spins some serious make believe magic as she sets up the next installment. Will Mavis and Sophie reach their goal weights? Will Ida overcome OCD? Will Toots save publishing? Anything can happen in La La land. (Sept.)

											A great read for those who want to see women get revenge but in a non-lethal format.  A great group of mature women who have been friends for a long time and still have that bond.  They attempt to help their Goddaughter out of a tight situation without her knowing they are behind it.  The only problem is that the book leaves you hanging and you don't know how the story ends.  You have to wait until the next book in the series comes out.  There were times when you couldn't help but chuckle about some of the events taking place in the storyline.  Would defintely recommond this book to all my friends.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/37160000/37160682.JPG" alt="" height="160" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Fern Michaels</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>Mary Kuczkir</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Summerville, South Carolina</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Hastings, Pennsylvania</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>High School</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Born Mary Ruth Kuczkir in Hastings, Pennsylvania, Fern Michaels was married and the mother of five before she embarked on her long, successful writing career � a career that began with something midway between a challenge and a command. When her youngest child went off to kindergarten, Michaels's husband imperiously ordered her (in just so many words) to get off her ass and get a job. Long years in the domestic trenches had left her short on marketable skills, so she decided trade off her lifelong love of reading and write a book. Just like that. The domineering, unsupportive husband is history. And Michaels has gone on to pen bestselling romance after bestselling romance. Just like that..<p>    With typical modesty, Michaels does not claim to be a great writer; however, she admits proudly to being a born storyteller. Her bulging bookshelf proves she is all over the map, producing with equal facility hot historicals, lighthearted contemporary capers, adrenaline-laced thrillers, and heartwarming tales of family and friendship. She is especially adept at writing stories about women who prevail in hard times � a reflection, perhaps, of her own struggles in her marriage and early career.<p>     Raised to believe that the fortunate in life  have an obligation to give back, Michaels devotes a lot of time to philanthropic concerns. She has established a foundation that grants four-year scholarships to needy students and has set up pre-schools and daycare centers for single mothers. She is also an avid animal lover and has been known to own as many as five dogs at a time.<p>     In 1993, Michaels picked up stakes and moved from her home in New Jersey to a 300-year-old plantation house in Charleston, South Carolina. She and the dogs share the house amicably with a friendly ghost whom Fern has dubbed Mary Margaret. In addition to stopping clocks and moving pillows from room to room, Mary Margaret has been known to occasionally leave flowers on Michaels's nightstand!</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Michaels confesses in our interview:</b> "I'm a junk food junkie and a chocoholic. My desk drawers have more junk food in them than paper and pens. I chomp and chew all day long. At night I get up and eat Marshmallow Fluff right out of the jar. In between eating, I write."<p>    <b>Her first "sort of, kind of job"</b> was in market research. Michaels recounts the gig's low-point in our interview: "I had a partner and we were testing a new pressurized drain cleaner. All you had to do was put this can in the drain, squeeze and supposedly the drain would open right up. It did, all right. <p>    "The whole wall collapsed, and stuff that was in there for a hundred years flew everywhere. The lady didn't tell us the drain backed up to her kitchen drain and disposal. The company didn't care that we smelled like a sewer or that our clothes were ruined. The lady got a new bathroom, and we both got fired." <p>     <b>Michaels reveals some of her sources</b> of inspiration: "Inspiration comes from everywhere. The title for <I>Finders Keepers</I> came from a cartoon with two chipmunks that my grandson was watching. I had a title but no story. I finally came up with one to fit that wonderful title. <p>    "Names for characters sometime come from television. I had a character named Metaxis which is odd to begin with. There is a news anchor on T.V. who has that same last name. Sometimes it will just be a word someone says in passing, something I read or saw. There's no rhyme or reason to it. It's almost like, okay, I need something here, stay alert and it will happen."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2002, Fern Michaels answered some of our questions.</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life -- and why?</b> <br>  It was a Nancy Drew book titled, <I>The Mystery of the Brass Bound Trunk</I> by Carolyn Keene. As a child, it had everything: a secret, a challenge, a young woman detective who drove a car, her family, her best friends, and who had an insatiable curiosity. I wanted to do what Carolyn Keene did -- write about a secrets, challenges, and women who persevered.

I like to buy furniture and kitchen gadgets. I have seven T.V.s in my house and turn them all on to news channels. I don't want to miss anything that is going on in the world.<p>    What I love most in the world are my kids and my grandkids and my five dogs. I have a very whimsical area on my second floor where all my dogs are painted on the walls. The ones who have gone over The Rainbow Bridge all have gold halos. Sometimes I go up there and cry.<p>    How do I unwind? With all the dogs on or around me. With a cigarette and a beer. Yes, I know, I shouldn't be doing that but I do. Sometimes if it's really stressful, I take the dogs for a run around my four acres. We run till we're breathless. When I can't sleep, I get up and go out on the verandah and listen to all the night sounds and drink a cup of tea. Along with that, Marshmallow Fluff I buy by the case. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Teresa &ldquo;Toots&rdquo; Amelia Loudenberry has crammed a great deal of living &mdash; not to mention eight much-loved husbands &mdash; into her varied and rewarding life.

Not that funerals  were, as a rule, events, but when someone of Leland  St. John's stature bit the dust, it became one. The  seven-piece string band playing in the downpour, per one  of Leland's last wishes, had turned it into an event regardless  of what else was going on in the world.  <p>     Then there was the tail end of Hurricane Blanche, which  was unleashing torrents of rain upon the mourners huddled  under the dark blue tent and only added to the circuslike  atmosphere.  <p>     "Will you just get on with it," Toots Loudenberry mumbled  under her breath. She continued to mutter and mumble  as the minister droned on and on. "No one is as good  as you're making Leland sound. All you know is what I  told you, and I sure as hell didn't tell you all that crap you're  spouting. He was a selfish, rich, old man. End of story."  <p>     Toots's daughter leaned closer to her mother and tried to  whisper through the thick veil covering her mother's head  and ears. "Can't you hurry it along? It's not like this is the  first time you've done this. Isn't this the seventh or eighth  husband you've buried? I'm damn glad that preacher said  his name, or I wouldn't even know who it is that's being  planted. I gotta say, Mom, you outdidyourself with all these  flowers."  <p>     Toots rose to the occasion and stepped forward, cutting  the minister off in midsentence. "Thank you, Reverend."  She wanted to say his check was in the mail, but she bit  her tongue as she took a step forward and laid her wilted  rose on top of the bronze coffin. She stepped aside so the  other mourners could follow her out from under the temporary  tent, which was open on all four sides. She stepped  in water up to her ankles, cursed ripely, and sloshed her  way to the waiting limousine, which would take her back  home. "That's just like you, Leland. Why couldn't you have  waited one more week, and the rainy season would have  been over? Now my shoes are ruined. So is my hat, as well  as my suit. Too bad you don't know how much this outfit  cost. If you did, you would have waited another week to die.  You always were selfish. See what all that selfishness got you.  You're dead."  <p>     "What are you mumbling about, Mom?"  <p>     Toots slid into the limousine and kicked off her sodden  shoes. Her black mourning hat followed. She looked over  at her daughter, Abby, who looked like a drowned rat, and  said, "Of all my husbands, I liked Leland the least. I resent  having to attend his funeral under these conditions. He  was my only mistake. But one out of eight, I suppose, isn't  too bad."  <p>     Abby reached for a wad of paper napkins next to the  champagne bottle that seemed to come with all limousines.  "Why didn't you just crisp him up?"  <p>     Toots sighed. "I wanted to, but Leland said in his will  that he wanted to be buried with that damn string band  playing music. One has to honor a person's last wishes.  What kind of person would I be if I didn't honor his, even  if he was a jerk?"  <p>     "Don't you mean if you didn't honor those last wishes,  what's-his-name's money would have gone to the polar  bears in the Arctic?"  <p>     "That, too." Toots sighed.  <p>     The woman born Teresa Amelia Loudenberry, Toots to  her friends, stared at her daughter. "How long are you  staying, dear?"  <p>     "I have a four o'clock flight. I left Chester with a sitter,  and Chester does not like sitters. There's just enough time  for me to grab something to eat at your post feast, change  into dry clothes, and get outta here. Can't you hear California  calling my name? Don't look at me like that, Mom.  I didn't even know that guy you married. I met him at  your wedding, and that's the sum total of our relationship.  If I remember correctly, you said he was a charmer. I expected  a charmer. I did not get a charmer. I'm just saying."  <p>     "Maybe I should have said snake charmer," Toots said  vaguely. "Leland was like this gorgeously wrapped present  that when opened was quite ... tacky. I was stunned, but I  did marry the man, so I had to make the best of it. He's  gone now, so perhaps we shouldn't speak ill of him. I'll  mourn for ten days for the sake of appearance, then get on  with my life. I'm going to find a hobby to keep myself  busy. I'm sick and tired of doing good deeds. Anyone can do  good deeds. Anyone can garden and grow one-of-a-kind  roses. I need to do something that will make a difference,  something challenging. Something I can really sink my teeth  into. That's another thing. Leland wore dentures. He kept  them in a cup in the bathroom at night. I could never get  used to that. He wasn't very good in bed, either."  <p> "That's probably more than I need to know, Mom."  <p>     "I'm just saying, Abby. I don't want you to think your  old mom is callous. You have to admit I did have seven  happy marriages. I should have hung up my garter belt  when Dolph died. Did I do that? No, I did not. I let Leland  sweep me off my feet, dentures and all. Sometimes life is so  unfair.  <p>     "That's enough of a pity party for me. Tell me how it's  going out there in sunny California. How's the job going?  What's the latest hot gossip, and who is doing what to  whom in Hollywood?"  <p>     Abby Simpson, Toots's daughter by her first husband,  John Simpson, the absolute love of Toots's life, was a reporter  for a second-rate tabloid, <i>The Informer</i>, based in  Los Angeles. She was a second-string runner, which meant  she had to hit the pavement and find her own stories, then  elaborate on them for the public's insatiable appetite for  Hollywood gossip.  <p>     "Rodwell Archibald Godfrey, otherwise known as Rag  to us underlings, called me into his office and told me he  wants more product. I can't make it happen if it isn't out  there. All the A-list papers seem to get the stories first. I  think this is just another way of saying he is not happy  with my work. I applied to the other tabloids, but they're  full up and not taking on anyone new. I'm doing my best.  I just manage to make my mortgage payment every month  and have enough left over to buy dog food. No, you cannot  help me, Mom. I'm going to make it on my own, so  let's not go down that road. My break is coming, I can feel  it. By the way, I brought a stack of future issues for you to  read. I have stuff in all of them."  <p>     "I can't get used to the idea that you people make all  that stuff up, then it happens. And you print weeks in advance  of what's happening," Toots said.  <p>     Abby laughed. "It's not quite that way, but you're close.  Well, we're home, and you have guests. You really know  how to throw a funeral, Mom."  <p>     "Event, dear. <i>Funeral</i> is such a dreary word. It conjures  up all kinds of dismal thinking."  <p>     Abby laughed as she climbed out of the limo and marched  up the steps to the wide veranda of her mother's house.  <p>     Both women raced upstairs to change into dry clothing  before they had to meet with the guests who would be  coming by to pay their last respects.  <p>     Toots looked at herself in the long mirror in her room.  Yes, she did look bedraggled, but wasn't a widow supposed  to look a little bedraggled? "Black is not my best color," she  muttered to herself as she tossed her mourning outfit into  a heap on the floor in the bathroom. She donned another  black dress, added a string of pearls, brushed out her hair,  sprayed on some perfume, and felt refreshed enough to go  downstairs and socialize for an hour or so.  <p>     Burying the dead was so time-consuming. Even the aftermath  took an eternity. All she wanted to do was retire to her  sitting room to read the pile of tabloids Abby had brought  with her. Not for the world would Toots ever admit that  she was addicted to tabloid gossip. But for now, she had a  duty to perform, and perform it she would. She had all evening  to read her treasured tabloids and guzzle a little wine  while doing so. She'd drink to Leland, and that would be the  end of this chapter in her life.  <p>     Time to move on. Something she was very good at.  <p>  <p>  <H4> Chapter Two </H4>  The minute the last guest walked out the door with a  go-bag of food, the bereaved Toots galloped up the  stairs and headed for her three-hundred-square-foot bathroom,  where she ran a bath. She made two trips to the  huge Jacuzzi with the pile of tabloids, four scented candles,  a fresh bottle of wine, and her favorite Baccarat wineglass.  She paused a minute to decide which bath salts she wanted  to use, finally settling on Confederate jasmine since the scent  was more or less true to the flower. She was, when you got  right down to it, a transplanted Southern belle.  <p>     Toots stripped down, and the clothes she was wearing  went on top of the sodden outfit she'd discarded earlier.  She'd never wear them again. Then again, since she was a  stickler for protocol, maybe she'd tell her housekeeper,  Bernice, to leave them until her ten days of mourning were  up. That way she wouldn't be cheating. And to think she  had to wear black, which really made her look washed  out, for another ten days. Nine more if you counted today.  Well, she was definitely counting today.  <p>     Toots sniffed at the delicious aroma emanating from the  Jacuzzi. Wonderful! She lowered herself into the silky water  and sighed happily. Toots leaned back and savored the first  few moments of the exquisite bath before leaning forward  to pour herself a glass of the bubbly that Leland had bought  by the truckload for his wine cellar.  <p>     "To you, Leland," Toots said as she held her wineglass  aloft. She turned up the glass and swallowed the contents  in one long gulp. Now she could move on. She'd done her  duty.  <p>     Toots refilled her glass, leaned back, and fired up a cigarette.  Smoking was a truly horrible habit, but she didn't  care. She was way too old to worry about what was good  or bad for her. She was all about living and didn't give a  thought to the fact that cigarettes would interfere with  that. Besides, she had every vice there was. She loved vices  because they made for such good conversations. She liked  to drink, smoke, was a sugar addict and a closet tabloid  reader. She'd long ago convinced herself that being a vegan  made up for all her bad habits. That shit, Leland, was forever  giving her grief for her, as he put it, unsavory habits.  "Screw you, Leland!"  <p>     Toots was on her third glass of wine and on page four of  the issue she was reading before she realized she couldn't  remember what she'd just read. What was wrong with her?  Nothing ever interfered with reading her beloved tabloids.  Until now. She closed her eyes and tried to figure out what  it was that was interfering with her universe.  <p>     Something was lurking somewhere inside her. She'd already  scratched Leland. Abby was okay, at least for the  moment. Did she feel rudderless? Did she need a man in  residence? Hell no, she didn't. Then what was bothering her?  The nine days of mourning she allowed herself? She snorted.  Any woman worth her salt could get through nine days of  mourning by going out to breakfast, lunch, and dinner every  day. Fit in a little shopping, and she'd be good to go.  <p>     By the fourth glass of wine, Toots decided she needed ...  no, she didn't need, she <i>wanted</i> to stir up some trouble. She  needed some excitement in her life. Her thoughts carried her  back in time to when she was young and full of piss and  vinegar with her friends. Friends she hadn't seen near enough  throughout the past twenty years. They e-mailed, called,  and sent Christmas cards, but life got in the way sometimes.  Maybe it was time to call all of them and invite them for a  visit. They were, after all, Abby's godmothers. Everyone  thought it strange that her daughter had three godmothers.  Especially that shithead, Leland. She didn't find it strange  at all. Neither did her friends.  <p>     Toots peered into the wine bottle. Empty! She climbed  out of the tub, dried off with a towel the size of a tent,  powdered herself, slipped into a black nightgown-because  she was in mourning-and tottered out to the minioffice in  her bedroom. It wasn't really an office, just a little table  where she sat to write notes to people she didn't give two  shits about, pay a few bills that she didn't want her business  manager to know about, and use her laptop to check  out TMZ and Page Six several times a day.  <p>     Toots fired up her laptop and proceeded to type an e-mail  to her friend Mavis, who lived in Maine in a little clapboard  house near the ocean.  <p>     <i>"I want you to come for a visit, Mavis. You were always  the one with the ideas. How soon can you get here? By the  way, I just buried Leland today, and I'm in a funk."</i>  <p>     Five minutes later, the laptop pinged receipt of a return  e-mail.  <p>     <i>"Sorry, Toots, I can't afford a trip like that. I can't leave  Coco, my dog. She's really my only friend these days. I'm  sorry your dog Leland died. I didn't even know you had a  dog. It's terrible when your beloved pet dies. Sorry, Toots,  I'd love to see you, but my pension just won't cover a trip  at this time."</i>  <p>     Toots blinked. How weird that Mavis thought Leland  was a dog. She wondered why she thought that, then it  dawned on her what her old friend meant.  <p>     She hit the REPLY button.  <p>     <i>"I'll send a first-class ticket for you and Coco. Leland  was my husband."</i>  <p>     The next response from Mavis was&#58; <i>"LOL, I forgot you  married again. Too bad, too sad. You'll get over it, Toots,  you always do. I'll be happy to accept your tickets and  look forward to seeing you. It's been way too long. Are the  others coming, too?"</i>  <p>     Toots fired back, <i>"I'm working on it now. More tomorrow."</i>  <p>     Toots's next e-mail was to Sophie, who'd married a philanderer,  now with one foot in the grave and the other on  a banana peel, according to Sophie's latest e-mail. It was a  known fact among the foursome that Sophie hated her  husband and was only sort of/more or less taking care of  him because of the five-million-dollar insurance policy she'd  taken out on him some years ago. "I'm sticking around long  enough to collect, then I'm outta here," she'd said.  <p>     <i>"Sophie, I'm e-mailing you to invite you for a visit. I'm  willing to send you a ticket if you can clear your calendar.  It's been way too long since we've seen each other. I have  something in mind that I think you and the others will find  interesting. It will be like old times."</i>  <p>     Sophie's response came through so quickly that Toots  was surprised. <i>"I can't leave him here alone. This old bird  is taking way too long to die. I didn't pay that mountain of  premiums all these years to get aced out of the payoff. Besides,  I want him to sweat every day and wonder if I'm  going to give him his meds and feed him. Which, of course,  I do. What kind of person would I be not to do that?"</i>  <p>     Well, Toots decided, she could certainly relate to that.  <i>"Not to worry, Sophie. I'll get you a nurse 24/7 for your  husband. So you'll come, then? By the way, I buried Leland  today."</i>  <p>     Sophie shot back. <i>"Okay, I'll clear my schedule that's  not really a schedule. Just let me know when my departure  date is. Who is Leland?"</i>  <p>     Toots responded to her e-mail. <i>"I'll get back to you on  the date. Leland was my husband. I have to do that tenday  mourning thing. Nine days if you count today. I am  definitely counting today. You can watch me and know  what it's like, so you'll know how to behave when that  dud you married bites the dust. Mourning is tricky. You  have to do it just right, or people will talk about you."  <p>     "What number is Leland?"</i> Sophie queried. "I think  you've been married more times than Elizabeth Taylor."  <p>     Toots quickly replied, <i>"Leland was number 8, and I am  never getting married again. More tomorrow. I have to  e-mail Ida now. She's going to be tough. Remember how  we hated each other and pretended we didn't? I think she's  still ticked off that I married the guy she wanted. She'd be  a widow now if I hadn't. I tried to tell her he was a big  nothing, but he did have all that money."</i>  <p>     Toots didn't bother waiting for a response before she  e-mailed Ida. She got right to the point. <i>"Ida, it's Toots. I'm  e-mailing you to invite you for a visit. Mavis and Sophie  have agreed to come, and it will be like old times. I have  this plan, Ida, and I want to involve all of us in it. I hope  you aren't still holding a grudge against me. It's time for us  to forget about all that old silly stuff. Believe it or not, I  did you a favor by stealing whatever his name was. Even his  money didn't make up for how boring he was. But he was  gentle and considerate. So, what do you think? By the way,  I buried Leland today. I'm in mourning, have nine days to  go."</i>  <p>     Ida's response was short and curt. <i>"Count me in. Tell  me when you want me to arrive. Oh, boo hoo about Leland."</i>  <p>     Toots rubbed her hands together and closed her laptop.  She was on a roll, she could feel it. Though what this big  plan was, she hadn't a clue just yet. She'd think of something.  She always did.  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>The Scoop</b> by <b>FERN MICHAELS</b>  Copyright &copy; 2009   by Fern Michaels.
