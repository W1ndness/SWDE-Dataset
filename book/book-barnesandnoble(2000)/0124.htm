She bought an armful of romance novels and writing books, set up a typewriter on a card table and wrote her first novel. Harlequin passed but Dell bit, and Brown was off and writing, publishing her works under an assortment of pseudonyms.     <p>From such modest beginnings, Brown has evolved into multimillion publishing empire of one, the CEO of her own literary brand; she towers over the landscape of romantic fiction. Brown has used her growing clout to insist her publishers drop the bosom-and-biceps covers and has added more intricate subplots, suspense, and even unhappy endings to her work. The result: A near-constant presence on <I>The New York Times</I> bestsellers list. In 1992, she had three on the list at the same time, joining that exclusive club of Stephen King, Tom Clancy, J. K. Rowling, and Danielle Steel. </p>    <p>Her work in the mainstream realm has taken her readers into The White House, where the president's newborn dies mysteriously; the oil fields and bedrooms of a <I>Dallas</I>-like family dynasty; and the sexual complications surrounding an investigation into an evangelist's murder. Such inventions have made her a distinct presence in a crowded genre.</P>     <P>"Brown is perhaps best known now for her longer novels of romantic suspense. The basic outline for these stories has passionate love, lust, and violence playing out against a background of unraveling secrets and skeletons jumping out of family closets," wrote Barbara E. Kemp in the book <I>Twentieth-Century Romance & Historical Writers</I> . Kemp also praises Brown's sharp dialogue and richly detailed characters. "However, her greatest key to success is probably that she invites her readers into a fantasy world of passion, intrigue, and danger," she wrote. "They too can face the moral and emotional dilemmas of the heroine, safe in the knowledge that justice and love will prevail." </p>    <p>Critics give her points for nimble storytelling but are cooler to her "serviceable prose," in the words of one <I>Publishers Weekly</I> reviewer. Still, when writing a crack page-turner, the plot's the thing. A 1992 <I> New York Times</I> review placed Brown among a group of a writers  "who have mastered the art of the slow tease." </p>    <p>Staggeringly prolific, Brown found her writing pace ground to a halt when she was given a different assignment. A magazine had asked her for an autobiographical piece, and it took her months to complete. Her life in the suburbs, though personally fulfilling, was nonetheless blander than fiction. That may be why she dives into her fiction writing with such workhorse gusto. "I love being the bad guy," she told <I>Publishers Weekly</I> in 1995, "simply because I was always so responsible, so predictable growing up. I made straight A's and never got into any trouble, and I still impose those standards on myself. So writing is my chance to escape and become the sleaziest, scummiest role." </p>    <p>When she started writing, her goal was always to break out of the parameters of romance. After about 45 romances, the woman who counts Tennessee Williams and Taylor Caldwell among her influences told <I>The New York Times</I> that felt she had reached a plateau. In fact, she doesn't even look at her books as romances anymore. "I think of my books now as suspense novels, usually with a love story incorporated," she said. "They're absolutely a lot harder to write than romances. They take more plotting and real character development. Each book is a stretch for me, and I try something interesting each time that males will like as well as women."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><LI>"I hate to exercise and only do so because I absolutely must."<P>   <LI>"I love to eat and my favorite foods are all bad for the body.  Fried chicken and gravy, TexMex, red meat (hey, I'm from Texas!).  My only saving grace is that I'm not that fond of sweets.  Salty is my thing.  Chocolate cake and ice cream I can skip.  But a bag of Fritos. . ."<P>   <LI>"It takes me a long time to go to sleep, usually because I read in bed and hate to put down the book.  But when I do nod off, I'm a champion sleeper.  I can easily do eight or nine hours a night."<P>         <LI>"My worst "thing" is mean-spirited people.  People who deliberately belittle or embarrass someone really irk me.  The people I admire most are the ones who find something good about even the most undesirable individual.   That was a quality my mother had, the one I hope most to emulate."<P>   <LI>"I have a fear of gravity.  Recently my whole family went to Belize.  We had several adventures.  We tubed a river through miles of cave, wearing head lamps so we'd have illumination.  No problem.  I scaled Mayan ruins.  I rode horseback (on a monster named Al Capone) through the rain forest.  No problem.  But I couldn't zip line.  Even though my five-year-old grandsons did it with glee, I just couldn't make that leap."<p>   <LI>"I and my husband are huge fans of <em>Jeopardy!</em>  We never miss it if we can help it.  Does that make us complete dorks?"<P></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>In the summer of 2009, Sandra Brown took some time out to talk with us about her favorite books, authors, and interests.</i><p>        <strong>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</strong><br>     <em>Testimony of Two Men</em> by Taylor Caldwell.  This novel has all the ingredients I love -- family strife, a man in torment, a beautiful love story.  The conflicts are believable because they're universal.  The characters are richly drawn. The reader is swept into their lives and struggles.  It's simply great storytelling. After reading it, I wanted to become Taylor Caldwell.<p>      <strong>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</strong><br>   In no particular sequence:   <li><em>Mila 18</em> by Leon Uris, who I believe is one of the greatest storytellers to put words on paper.  This novel lived with me long after I finished it.  The tragic story continues to haunt me.  It's about hate at its worst and love at its best. Even though the ending is sad, it pays homage to the indomitable strength of the human spirit.<p>   <li>A tie: <em>The Assassin</em> and <em>Rendezvous</em>.   Both by Evelyn Anthony, these novels are what every romantic suspense should be.  They're rife with danger, intrigue, and have a dilemma from which there is no easy escape for either of the main characters.  In both stories, loyalties are tested.  That's another element I love - the moral dilemma.<p>   <li> <em>The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B.</em>  by Sandra Gulland.  This book is the first of an excellent trilogy about Josephine Bonaparte.  I put off reading it  for a long time, erroneously thinking that I wouldn't like it as well as those readers who had recommended it to me.  I was wrong.  Told in letter and diary form, the story  captivated me from the first page.  As Ms. Gulland warns her reader, Josephine and Napoleon are addictive subjects.  Even after reading all three books, I couldn't get enough of them.  As far from the genre in which I write as it could possibly be, this book is still one of my favorites which I frequently recommend.<p>   <li><em>Eye of the Needle</em> by Ken Follett.  He wouldn't know how to write a  bad book.  I've devoured all of them, including his two lengthy historicals, Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  But I "discovered" him with this novel and it remains a standout.  Fascinating character.  It's difficult to write an anti-hero - a ruthless spy, no less -- and make him human, make him even remotely sympathetic, and yet Follett did.<p>   <li><em>The Rainbow Season</em> by Candace Camp, writing as Lisa Gregory.  When I first hung out my shingle, proclaiming myself a writer, this is one of the first books recommended to me as a "how-to."  I read it from start to finish about three times before putting it down.  It's a wonderful romance, having all the elements that define the genre, plus the magic that defies definition.  The reader simply cannot wait for these two people to realize they're in love.  Terrific voyeurism.   For the sheer toe-tingling joy of it, I read it about once a year.<p>   <li><em>The Exorcist</em>  by William Peter Blatty.  If Favorite Books are described as those that have the most impact, and pack the strongest punch, then this novel demands to be on this list.  I remember well when I was reading it.  I started hearing noises in the attic. . .and we didn't even have an attic!  It scared me silly.  It still does.  Blatty's word images were so vivid that, as hard as Hollywood filmmakers tried, they couldn't portray the demon as terrifyingly as he did.<p>   <li><em>The Pilot's Wife</em> by Anita Shreve.  Since reading this, I've read all Ms. Shreve's books and have loved each one.  But this is the first one I read, and it made me an immediate fan, so it deserves mention on this list.  Oh, and lest you think that's the only reason I'm including it, it also happens to be excellent.  Experiencing the heroine's heartbreaking disillusionment is torture of the best kind.<p>   <li><em>The Flame and the Flower</em> by Kathleen Woodiwiss.  Every romance writer who came after owes her a debt of gratitude because she, almost single-handedly, gave life to this genre.  This is another of those books that I read every year or so just for the absolute happiness it gives me.   It's enchanting.  It's pure escapism, and I don't know of a better reason than that to read a work of fiction.  No explanation or justification necessary.<p>     <li><em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> by Harper Lee and <em>Gone With the Wind</em> by Margaret Mitchell.  Another tie because they're equally wonderful stories and each gave us an iconic character, Atticus Finch and Scarlett O'Hara respectively. The two authors had much to say on the subjects of  love and war, loyalty and friendship, bigotry and honor, yet each folded the editorials into compelling, irresistible stories which the reader is fooled into believing he's reading solely for pleasure.<p>          <strong>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</strong><br>   <li><em>Out of Africa</em> -- Streep and Redford under Sydney Pollack's direction.   A true story.  Breathtaking film images.  Just about a perfect movie.<p>   <li><em>The Godfather</em>.  If I'm channel surfing and I see this film is on, no matter at what point I join it, I finish it.  It's totally compelling.   The best acting scene ever on film: Brando in the vegetable garden with his grandson moments before he dies.  Flawless.  You believe it.<p>   <li><em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>.  Anything with Morgan Freeman (like <em>Driving Miss Daisy</em>) is superb.  This story, adapted from Stephen King's short story, is mesmerizing.<p>   <li><em>Legends of the Fall</em>.  This movie got panned by so many critics, and I just don't get it.  I loved it!  It was melodramatic, sure, but I adore melodrama.  Did the critics hate it because the cast was so pretty?  If so, they need to get over it.<p>   <li><em>An Officer and a Gentleman</em>.  Again, the perfect combination of actor and director.  Gere and Hackford.  A film which so easily could have been awful was great because Gere gave such heart to the character of Mayo.  Under the swagger, we feel his pain. Great script.  Perfectly cast.  And to think Gere wasn't first choice.<p>   <li><em>Tombstone</em> -- because I love cowboys and Kurt Russell and  Sam Elliott and Michael Biehn and Powers Boothe and Stephen Lang (who's read some of my audio books) and on and on.  I relish every frame, every jingle of spurs.<p>   <li><em>Emma</em> with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam and <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> with Colin Firth and  Jennifer Ehle.  Because everybody needs a dose of Jane Austen every now and then.  I watch them over and over and over. . .<p>   <li><em>Dear Frankie</em> is the sweetest little movie that no one has ever heard of.  It stars Emily Mortimer and Gerard Butler.  Yes, him.  Before he became so famous.  I dare you to get the DVD and watch it.  And I double dare you not to get a knot in your throat.<p>   Then there are <em>Love With the Perfect Stranger</em>, <em>This Property is Condemned</em>, and <em>The Way We Were</em>, all directed by Sydney Pollack.  There's <em>Twelve Angry Men</em> and <em>In the Heat of the Night</em>. And <em>Body Heat</em>.  I could go on and on.<p>         <strong>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</strong><br>   In my car I listen to either country or classic rock.  When I'm writing I listen to instrumentals - either easy listening type stuff, or movie themes, or light classical.  I can't listen to music with lyrics when I'm writing.  I love show music, too. <p>       <strong>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</strong><br>   For Father's Day I gave my son Paul Newman's biography.  My son-in-law got a coffeetable book on the history of baseball.  I recently gave my daughter <em>The Other Boleyn Girl</em>. And my daughter-in-law received a book about the War of the Roses because I knew she'd like that.  I give my husband  every WWII book that comes out because of his interest in it.  One grandson recently got a book about the Wright brothers because he's fascinated with airplanes and another grandson got one about baseball.  I give books that I think the recipient will enjoy.   As for the books I like getting, one can't go wrong.  I like everything!<p>       <strong>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</strong><br>   I drink General Foods International coffee French Vanilla.  In the morning, I have two cups.  On my desk is a small warming plate to keep the cup warm.  In the afternoon, I switch to Evian.  I'm all about creature comfort, so there are scented candles in the room, living plants and fresh flowers, and -- always -- family pictures.  These are the things that make me happy.<p>      <strong>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</strong><br>   The first book I sold (in 1980) was to Dell for a romance series called Ecstasy.  The editor soon bought my second.  I became a prolific author for several romance lines, writing five or six of them a year.  In 1987 I began crossing over into suspense and in 1990 I made the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list for the first time with a paperback original, <em>Mirror Image</em>.  That changed my life.  I had published over 50 books by that time.  I was no better a writer on May 23, 1990 than I'd been on May 22, 1990, but I was perceived by the industry to be much better.  It's staggering to me that next year I will celebrate 30 years of being published.  Each time a book appears on the bestseller list, I feel that it's a "breakthrough."  I don't take it for granted.  It propels me to constantly strive to do better.<p>      <strong>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</strong><br>   Read, read, read.  And write, write, write.  I don't know of any shortcuts.  You must spend hours, days, weeks, months alone in a room putting words on paper.  You can read how-to books on writing, attend workshops, join critique groups, take courses on creative writing. . .and all that is good.  But at some point you've got to do the WORK.  That's what no one wants to hear.  It's not work for the faint of heart or the undisciplined.<p>   Write from your gut as much as from your head.  If it feels right, write it down.  But don't get too possessive of it that you don't take well-meaning advice.  If two or three people give you the same criticism, be wise and listen.  A good writer must be willing to edit.  At least half of my time is spent rewriting.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>The first book in #1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author Sandra Brown&rsquo;s beloved Texas! trilogy introduces readers to a close-knit family struggling to go on without its patriarch&mdash;and to a man in pursuit of an elusive woman who may hold his future in her hands.<br>&#160;<br>Charismatic and easy on the eyes, Lucky Tyler is a born rebel.

Bothered again by the rough, masculine laughter coming from one corner of the tavern, he glanced irritably over his shoulder to look in that direction.<br><br>&quot;Might've known Little Alvin would sniff her out,&quot; the bartender said.<br><br>Lucky only grunted in response. Turning back to his drink, he hunched his shoulders and sank a little deeper into his slouching position on the barstool. He reasoned that if the broad hadn't wanted the attentions of Little Alvin or any other guy, she wouldn't have come into the lounge alone.<br><br>Describing the place as a lounge sure was euphemistic, he thought. The place was a bona fide honky-tonk. It didn't possess a single feature that would elevate it to any higher caliber of drinking hole than that.<br><br>It had first opened during the boom, fifty or so years earlier. Before the bar had a flashing neon star out front, before it had indoor plumbing, the place had served bootleg liquor to roughnecks, wildcatters, and the ladies of the night who comforted them when the wells turned up dry or who took their money when they struck black gold.<br><br>The highway tavern hadn't had a name then that anybody could remember, and it didn't have one now. It was simply known to locals as &quot;the place,&quot; as in, &quot;Meet'chu at the place after work for a drink.&quot; Respectable men frequented it alongside those who weren't respectable.<br><br>But a respectable woman wouldn't be caught dead inside. If a woman came to the place, she was there for one reason and one reason only. The instant a woman alone darkened the door, hunting season commenced. It was understood.<br><br>That's why Lucky wasn't too concerned about the welfare of the woman being hassled by Little Alvin and one of his least savory companions, Jack Ed Patterson.<br><br>However, when another burst of laughter erupted from the corner, Lucky swung his gaze around again. Several things struck him as odd. A long-neck beer stood on the chipped Formica table in front of the woman, along with a half-filled glass. A glass? She must have requested it, because at the place long necks weren't usually served with a glass even to a woman. Strange that she had asked for a glass.<br><br>She wasn't exactly dolled up either. Oh, she was good-looking, all right, but her makeup was conservative, and her clothing upscale and chic. She wasn't your ordinary gal-about-town on the prowl or even a housewife looking for a distraction from the daily grind or revenge on an inattentive husband. He couldn't quite pigeonhole her, and that intrigued him.<br><br>&quot;How long's she been here?&quot; he asked the bartender.<br><br>&quot;Got here 'bout a half hour 'fore you came in. Know her?&quot;<br><br>Lucky shook his head no.<br><br>&quot;Then she sure as hell ain't from around here.&quot; The bartender guffawed, implying that Lucky kept a more accurate account of the local female population than the Census Bureau. Which was the truth.<br><br>&quot;Soon as she came in and ordered her beer, she drew everybody's attention like flies to honey. 'Course, the rest backed off when Little Alvin showed more than a passing interest.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, he's a real ladies' man, all right,&quot; Lucky said sardonically.<br><br>Little Alvin had been so dubbed merely because he was eighth of the eight offspring born to the Cagneys. Standing 6' 5'', he weighed about 290, 30 pounds of it put on since he had left the NFL several years earlier.<br><br>He'd been playing first-string linebacker for the Denver Broncos when he caused a league controversy. One of his quarterback sacks had left a rookie Dolphins player with blurred vision, stuttering speech, and a retirement pension.<br><br>The tackle had been so unnecessarily rough, Little Alvin himself had suffered a dislocated shoulder. The team management had used his injury as its reason for not picking up his contract at the end of that season, but it was speculated that management was glad of the excuse to get rid of him.<br><br>Upon his suspension, Little Alvin had returned home to East Texas and picked up where he'd left off years before as Milton Point's meanest bully. He still considered himself a superstud football hero.<br>Tonight neither his dubious charm nor his fame were working on the woman he'd set his sights on. Even from across the dim, smoky lounge, Lucky could see that she was growing more agitated by the minute.<br><br>The George Straight ballad blaring from the jukebox prevented him from hearing the words they exchanged, but when Little Alvin laid a meaty hand on the woman's shoulder, there was no mistaking how she felt about his romantic overtures. She shrugged off his hand and reached for her purse. She attempted to slide out of the booth, but 290 pounds of Little Alvin Cagney, along with his sidekick, Jack Ed Patterson, who had recently done time in Huntsville State Prison for assault with a deadly weapon, blocked her escape.<br><br>Lucky sighed. He was going to have to do something about this, and damned if he was in the mood for it. It had been a hell of a week. Business was rotten, and a loan payment was only weeks away from coming due. Susan was dropping hints about a diamond ring for her left hand. The last thing he needed was a run-in with a couple of lowlifes like Little Alvin and Jack Ed.<br><br>But what if their quarry had been his kid sister, Sage? He would like to think that some decent guy would come to her aid. Of course, Sage was smart enough not to get herself into a sticky situation like this. But you couldn't decline to protect a woman's virtue just because she was dim-witted.<br><br>His daddy had drilled into him and Chase, his older brother by a year and a half, that when a lady said no to a pass, the answer was no. Period. No questions asked. The woman might not be very nice for leading a guy on and then changing her mind at the last minute, but the answer was still, unequivocally, no. And his mother expected him to treat every woman chivalrously, no matter how trashy she was.<br><br>His ears still rang whenever he recalled the lecture his mother had given him in the ninth grade, when he brought home the delicious gossip that Drucilla Hawkins had &quot;done it&quot; at the drive-in the previous Saturday night. What had gone on in the backseat of her boyfriend's blue Dodge was the talk of the school.<br><br>Laurie Tyler wasn't interested in the juicy details of Miss Hawkins's fall from grace. She had sternly warned her younger son that he had better not be overheard defaming any girl's reputation, no matter how reliable the source of the gossip was. He'd been admonished to treat every woman&#8212;and her reputation&#8212;with respect and dignity. It had been such a scalding lecture that he remembered it to this day, nearly twenty years later, at the ripe old age of thirty-two.<br><br>He muttered another foul curse beneath his breath, and tossed back the remainder of his drink. Some things you had to do whether you wanted to or not. Defending a woman from Little Alvin and Jack Ed was one of those things.<br><br>One booted foot, then the other, unhooked its heel from the chrome rung encircling the legs of the barstool. Lucky swiveled around on the maroon vinyl seat, worn slick and smooth by too many rear ends to count.<br><br>&quot;Careful, Lucky,&quot; the bartender warned. &quot;They've been drinking all afternoon. You know how mean Little Alvin gets when he's drunk. Jack Ed's bound to have his knife handy, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm not looking for trouble.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe not, but if you cut in on Little Alvin's action, you'll get trouble.&quot;<br><br>Apparently everyone else in the place smelled trouble, too, because the moment Lucky left his stool at the bar, bells on the pinball machines fell silent for the first time in hours. The row of video games still beeped and burped and flashed a kaleidoscope of electronic colors, but those playing them turned curiously, instantly attuned to the sudden shift in the atmosphere. It was like the expectant stillness before a tornado struck.<br><br>Drinkers at the bar and those occupying booths ceased conversations to follow Lucky's swaggering progress across the room toward the booth where the woman was demanding that an amused Little Alvin get out of her way.<br><br>&quot;I'd like to leave now.&quot;<br><br>Lucky wasn't fooled by the quiet calm in her voice. Her eyes were shifting nervously between the two men. Jack Ed was a fraction of Little Alvin's size, but in his own way he was intimidating. He had a ferret's eyes and the sharp, pointed grin of a jackal. They hadn't fallen for her phony defiance any more than he had.<br><br>&quot;How come you're in such a hurry, honey?&quot; Little Alvin cooed. He bent over her so far, she recoiled into the corner of the booth. &quot;We're just startin' to have fun.&quot;<br><br>Jack Ed giggled at his friend's clever way with words. His laughter broke off when Lucky spoke from behind him.<br><br>&quot;I don't think the lady's having any fun a-tall, Alvin.&quot;<br><br>Little Alvin came around with all the grace, agility and temperament of a bull whose tail had just been given a hard yank. Lucky was standing with one thumb tucked beneath his waistband, the hand casually curled over his tooled-leather belt, and the other braced against the tarnished brass hat rack mounted on the end of the neighboring booth. His feet were crossed at the ankles. He was smiling pleasantly. Only the cocky tilt of his dark blond head and the coldness of his blue eyes belied his friendly tone of voice.<br><br>&quot;Bug off, Tyler. This is none of your b'iness.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I think it is. Since a dumb slab of meat like you doesn't seem to appeal to the lady, she's still fair game, right?&quot; Lucky looked down at the woman and gave her the warm smile and lazy wink that had coaxed a legion of women out of their better judgment and their clothing. &quot;Hi. How're you doin'?&quot;<br>Little Alvin growled his disapproval and took two hulking footsteps toward Lucky, whom he championed in size by three inches in height and a hundred pounds. He swung a ham-size fist toward Lucky's head.<br><br>Lucky, for all his seeming nonchalance, was braced and ready for the attack. He parried quickly to his left, ducking the blow and simultaneously catching Jack Ed under the chin with his elbow. Everybody in the place heard his lupine teeth smash together. Jack Ed careened into the nearest pinball machine, which set up a chorus of ringing bells.<br><br>Having temporarily dispatched Jack Ed, Lucky pivoted in time to place his right eye directly in the path of Alvin's ramming right fist. Lucky had been kicked in the head by a horse when he was twelve. The kick had knocked him cold. It hadn't hurt nearly as much as Alvin's punch.<br><br>His whole body shivered with the pain of the impact. If he'd had time to indulge it, his stomach would have rebelled by heaving up two glasses of whiskey and water. As it was, he knew he had to either get back into the fight or die at the enraged hands of Little Alvin Cagney.<br><br>Bar patrons were cheering him on, except those who feared reprisal from Alvin. Knowing all he had on his side were dexterity and speed, he lowered his head and drove his shoulder into Alvin's gut, knocking the larger man off balance.<br><br>A sudden shout warned him of Jack Ed's recovery. Spinning around, he barely had time to suck in his midsection before Jack Ed took a swipe at it with his infamous knife. He kicked the extended knife out of Jack Ed's hand, then gave him a quick chop in the Adam's apple with the edge of his hand. The ex-con toppled into a table; it crashed to the floor. Jack Ed sprawled beside it, unconscious, lying in a puddle of spilled beer and broken glass.<br><br>Lucky came around again to confront Alvin. Looking like the provoked giant in a Grimm's tale, the former linebacker was crouched in an attack stance.<br><br>&quot;Stop this!&quot;<br><br>The woman was out of the booth. Hands on hips, she was furiously addressing both of them, though Lucky seemed the only one aware of her. Little Alvin's eyes were red with fury. His nostrils were receding and expanding like twin bellows.<br><br>&quot;Get out of the way or you'll get hurt!&quot; Lucky shouted to her.<br><br>&quot;I want this to stop. You're behaving like&#8212;&quot;<br><br>Little Alvin, giving her no more regard than he would a pesky housefly, flicked his hand at her, catching her lip and drawing blood. She fell backward.<br><br>&quot;You son of a bitch,&quot; Lucky snarled. Any brute who would strike a woman didn't deserve a clean fight. Swinging up his booted foot, he viciously caught the other man in the crotch.<br><br>Instantly Little Alvin was stunned motionless, seemingly held upright by the gasps that rose from the onlookers. Then he clutched the injured area and dropped to his knees, rattling glassware throughout the building. At last, eyes crossing, he went over face first into the puddle of beer beside Jack Ed.<br><br>Lucky gulped in several cleansing breaths and tentatively dabbed at his swelling eye. Stiffly he approached the woman, who was attempting to stanch her bleeding lip with a paper napkin.<br><br>&quot;You all right?&quot;<br><br>She flung her head up and glared at him with vivid green eyes. Lucky, expecting tears, admiration, and gushing gratitude, was startled to see naked enmity on her face.<br><br>&quot;Thanks a lot,&quot; she said sarcastically. &quot;You were a big help.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wha&#8212;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lucky,&quot; the bartender called to him, &quot;here comes the sheriff.&quot;<br><br>Lucky blew out a gust of breath as he surveyed the damage the fight had caused. Overturned tables and chairs made the place look as if it had sustained storm damage.

Lucky <br></b> <hr noshade size="1"><br><b> By Sandra Brown </b><br></hr> <b><b> Bantam </b></b> <br><b> Copyright &copy; 2008 </b><br> <br><b> Sandra Brown <br>All right reserved.</b><br><br> <br><b> ISBN&#58; 9780553804034 </b><br><br> <hr noshade size='1'></hr>   <i>Chapter One</i><br><br><br>There was going to be trouble, and, hell, he just wasn't in the mood for it.<br><br>Lucky Tyler, seated on a barstool, was nursing his second whiskey and water. Bothered again by the rough, masculine laughter coming from one corner of the tavern, he glanced irritably over his shoulder to look in that direction.<br><br>&quot;Might've known Little Alvin would sniff her out,&quot; the bartender said.<br><br>Lucky only grunted in response. Turning back to his drink, he hunched his shoulders and sank a little deeper into his slouching position on the barstool. He reasoned that if the broad hadn't wanted the attentions of Little Alvin or any other guy, she wouldn't have come into the lounge alone.<br><br>Describing the place as a lounge sure was euphemistic, he thought. The place was a bona fide honky-tonk. It didn't possess a single feature that would elevate it to any higher caliber of drinking hole than that.<br><br>It had first opened during the boom, fifty or so years earlier. Before the bar had a flashing neon star out front, before it had indoor plumbing, the place had served bootleg liquor to roughnecks, wildcatters, and the ladies of the night who comforted them when the wells turned up dry or who took their money when they struck black gold.<br><br>The highway tavern hadn't had a name then that anybody could remember, and it didn't have one now. It was simplyknown to locals as &quot;the place,&quot; as in, &quot;Meet'chu at the place after work for a drink.&quot; Respectable men frequented it alongside those who weren't respectable.<br><br>But a respectable woman wouldn't be caught dead inside. If a woman came to the place, she was there for one reason and one reason only. The instant a woman alone darkened the door, hunting season commenced. It was understood.<br><br>That's why Lucky wasn't too concerned about the welfare of the woman being hassled by Little Alvin and one of his least savory companions, Jack Ed Patterson.<br><br>However, when another burst of laughter erupted from the corner, Lucky swung his gaze around again. Several things struck him as odd. A long-neck beer stood on the chipped Formica table in front of the woman, along with a half-filled glass. A glass? She must have requested it, because at the place long necks weren't usually served with a glass even to a woman. Strange that she had asked for a glass.<br><br>She wasn't exactly dolled up either. Oh, she was good-looking, all right, but her makeup was conservative, and her clothing upscale and chic. She wasn't your ordinary gal-about-town on the prowl or even a housewife looking for a distraction from the daily grind or revenge on an inattentive husband. He couldn't quite pigeonhole her, and that intrigued him.<br><br>&quot;How long's she been here?&quot; he asked the bartender.<br><br>&quot;Got here 'bout a half hour 'fore you came in. Know her?&quot;<br><br>Lucky shook his head no.<br><br>&quot;Then she sure as hell ain't from around here.&quot; The bartender guffawed, implying that Lucky kept a more accurate account of the local female population than the Census Bureau. Which was the truth.<br><br>&quot;Soon as she came in and ordered her beer, she drew everybody's attention like flies to honey. 'Course, the rest backed off when Little Alvin showed more than a passing interest.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, he's a real ladies' man, all right,&quot; Lucky said sardonically.<br><br>Little Alvin had been so dubbed merely because he was eighth of the eight offspring born to the Cagneys. Standing 6' 5", he weighed about 290, 30 pounds of it put on since he had left the NFL several years earlier.<br><br>He'd been playing first-string linebacker for the Denver Broncos when he caused a league controversy. One of his quarterback sacks had left a rookie Dolphins player with blurred vision, stuttering speech, and a retirement pension.<br><br>The tackle had been so unnecessarily rough, Little Alvin himself had suffered a dislocated shoulder. The team management had used his injury as its reason for not picking up his contract at the end of that season, but it was speculated that management was glad of the excuse to get rid of him.<br><br>Upon his suspension, Little Alvin had returned home to East Texas and picked up where he'd left off years before as Milton Point's meanest bully. He still considered himself a superstud football hero.<br>Tonight neither his dubious charm nor his fame were working on the woman he'd set his sights on. Even from across the dim, smoky lounge, Lucky could see that she was growing more agitated by the minute.<br><br>The George Straight ballad blaring from the jukebox prevented him from hearing the words they exchanged, but when Little Alvin laid a meaty hand on the woman's shoulder, there was no mistaking how she felt about his romantic overtures. She shrugged off his hand and reached for her purse. She attempted to slide out of the booth, but 290 pounds of Little Alvin Cagney, along with his sidekick, Jack Ed Patterson, who had recently done time in Huntsville State Prison for assault with a deadly weapon, blocked her escape.<br><br>Lucky sighed. He was going to have to do something about this, and damned if he was in the mood for it. It had been a hell of a week. Business was rotten, and a loan payment was only weeks away from coming due. Susan was dropping hints about a diamond ring for her left hand. The last thing he needed was a run-in with a couple of lowlifes like Little Alvin and Jack Ed.<br><br>But what if their quarry had been his kid sister, Sage? He would like to think that some decent guy would come to her aid. Of course, Sage was smart enough not to get herself into a sticky situation like this. But you couldn't decline to protect a woman's virtue just because she was dim-witted.<br><br>His daddy had drilled into him and Chase, his older brother by a year and a half, that when a lady said no to a pass, the answer was no. Period. No questions asked. The woman might not be very nice for leading a guy on and then changing her mind at the last minute, but the answer was still, unequivocally, no. And his mother expected him to treat every woman chivalrously, no matter how trashy she was.<br><br>His ears still rang whenever he recalled the lecture his mother had given him in the ninth grade, when he brought home the delicious gossip that Drucilla Hawkins had &quot;done it&quot; at the drive-in the previous Saturday night. What had gone on in the backseat of her boyfriend's blue Dodge was the talk of the school.<br><br>Laurie Tyler wasn't interested in the juicy details of Miss Hawkins's fall from grace. She had sternly warned her younger son that he had better not be overheard defaming any girl's reputation, no matter how reliable the source of the gossip was. He'd been admonished to treat every woman&#8212;and her reputation&#8212;with respect and dignity. It had been such a scalding lecture that he remembered it to this day, nearly twenty years later, at the ripe old age of thirty-two.<br><br>He muttered another foul curse beneath his breath, and tossed back the remainder of his drink. Some things you had to do whether you wanted to or not. Defending a woman from Little Alvin and Jack Ed was one of those things.<br><br>One booted foot, then the other, unhooked its heel from the chrome rung encircling the legs of the barstool. Lucky swiveled around on the maroon vinyl seat, worn slick and smooth by too many rear ends to count.<br><br>&quot;Careful, Lucky,&quot; the bartender warned. &quot;They've been drinking all afternoon. You know how mean Little Alvin gets when he's drunk. Jack Ed's bound to have his knife handy, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm not looking for trouble.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe not, but if you cut in on Little Alvin's action, you'll get trouble.&quot;<br><br>Apparently everyone else in the place smelled trouble, too, because the moment Lucky left his stool at the bar, bells on the pinball machines fell silent for the first time in hours. The row of video games still beeped and burped and flashed a kaleidoscope of electronic colors, but those playing them turned curiously, instantly attuned to the sudden shift in the atmosphere. It was like the expectant stillness before a tornado struck.<br><br>Drinkers at the bar and those occupying booths ceased conversations to follow Lucky's swaggering progress across the room toward the booth where the woman was demanding that an amused Little Alvin get out of her way.<br><br>&quot;I'd like to leave now.&quot;<br><br>Lucky wasn't fooled by the quiet calm in her voice. Her eyes were shifting nervously between the two men. Jack Ed was a fraction of Little Alvin's size, but in his own way he was intimidating. He had a ferret's eyes and the sharp, pointed grin of a jackal. They hadn't fallen for her phony defiance any more than he had.<br><br>&quot;How come you're in such a hurry, honey?&quot; Little Alvin cooed. He bent over her so far, she recoiled into the corner of the booth. &quot;We're just startin' to have fun.&quot;<br><br>Jack Ed giggled at his friend's clever way with words. His laughter broke off when Lucky spoke from behind him.<br><br>&quot;I don't think the lady's having any fun a-tall, Alvin.&quot;<br><br>Little Alvin came around with all the grace, agility and temperament of a bull whose tail had just been given a hard yank. Lucky was standing with one thumb tucked beneath his waistband, the hand casually curled over his tooled-leather belt, and the other braced against the tarnished brass hat rack mounted on the end of the neighboring booth. His feet were crossed at the ankles. He was smiling pleasantly. Only the cocky tilt of his dark blond head and the coldness of his blue eyes belied his friendly tone of voice.<br><br>&quot;Bug off, Tyler. This is none of your b'iness.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I think it is. Since a dumb slab of meat like you doesn't seem to appeal to the lady, she's still fair game, right?&quot; Lucky looked down at the woman and gave her the warm smile and lazy wink that had coaxed a legion of women out of their better judgment and their clothing. &quot;Hi. How're you doin'?&quot;<br>Little Alvin growled his disapproval and took two hulking footsteps toward Lucky, whom he championed in size by three inches in height and a hundred pounds. He swung a ham-size fist toward Lucky's head.<br><br>Lucky, for all his seeming nonchalance, was braced and ready for the attack. He parried quickly to his left, ducking the blow and simultaneously catching Jack Ed under the chin with his elbow. Everybody in the place heard his lupine teeth smash together. Jack Ed careened into the nearest pinball machine, which set up a chorus of ringing bells.<br><br>Having temporarily dispatched Jack Ed, Lucky pivoted in time to place his right eye directly in the path of Alvin's ramming right fist. Lucky had been kicked in the head by a horse when he was twelve. The kick had knocked him cold. It hadn't hurt nearly as much as Alvin's punch.<br><br>His whole body shivered with the pain of the impact. If he'd had time to indulge it, his stomach would have rebelled by heaving up two glasses of whiskey and water. As it was, he knew he had to either get back into the fight or die at the enraged hands of Little Alvin Cagney.<br><br>Bar patrons were cheering him on, except those who feared reprisal from Alvin. Knowing all he had on his side were dexterity and speed, he lowered his head and drove his shoulder into Alvin's gut, knocking the larger man off balance.<br><br>A sudden shout warned him of Jack Ed's recovery. Spinning around, he barely had time to suck in his midsection before Jack Ed took a swipe at it with his infamous knife. He kicked the extended knife out of Jack Ed's hand, then gave him a quick chop in the Adam's apple with the edge of his hand. The ex-con toppled into a table; it crashed to the floor. Jack Ed sprawled beside it, unconscious, lying in a puddle of spilled beer and broken glass.<br><br>Lucky came around again to confront Alvin. Looking like the provoked giant in a Grimm's tale, the former linebacker was crouched in an attack stance.<br><br>&quot;Stop this!&quot;<br><br>The woman was out of the booth. Hands on hips, she was furiously addressing both of them, though Lucky seemed the only one aware of her. Little Alvin's eyes were red with fury. His nostrils were receding and expanding like twin bellows.<br><br>&quot;Get out of the way or you'll get hurt!&quot; Lucky shouted to her.<br><br>&quot;I want this to stop. You're behaving like&#8212;&quot;<br><br>Little Alvin, giving her no more regard than he would a pesky housefly, flicked his hand at her, catching her lip and drawing blood. She fell backward.<br><br>&quot;You son of a bitch,&quot; Lucky snarled. Any brute who would strike a woman didn't deserve a clean fight. Swinging up his booted foot, he viciously caught the other man in the crotch.<br><br>Instantly Little Alvin was stunned motionless, seemingly held upright by the gasps that rose from the onlookers. Then he clutched the injured area and dropped to his knees, rattling glassware throughout the building. At last, eyes crossing, he went over face first into the puddle of beer beside Jack Ed.<br><br>Lucky gulped in several cleansing breaths and tentatively dabbed at his swelling eye. Stiffly he approached the woman, who was attempting to stanch her bleeding lip with a paper napkin.<br><br>&quot;You all right?&quot;<br><br>She flung her head up and glared at him with vivid green eyes. Lucky, expecting tears, admiration, and gushing gratitude, was startled to see naked enmity on her face.<br><br>&quot;Thanks a lot,&quot; she said sarcastically. &quot;You were a big help.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wha&#8212;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lucky,&quot; the bartender called to him, &quot;here comes the sheriff.&quot;<br><br>Lucky blew out a gust of breath as he surveyed the damage the fight had caused. Overturned tables and chairs made the place look as if it had sustained storm damage. Broken glass, spilled beer, and capsized ashtrays had left a disgusting mess on the floor where two battered bodies still lay.<br><br>And the ungrateful tart, whose honor he had stupidly defended, was mad at him.<br><br>Some days, no matter how hard you tried, nothing went right. Placing his hands on his hips, his head dropping forward, he muttered, &quot;Hell.&quot; <BR><BR><i>Continues...</i>  <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><br> Excerpted from <b>Texas!
