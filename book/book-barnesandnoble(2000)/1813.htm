											In 1991 in Marblehead, Massachusetts fifteen years old Charlie St. Cloud and his twelve years old brother Sam steal a neighbor's station wagon to go to the Red Sox game.  They have a good time at the ball park, but on the way home while crossing the Saugus River, Charlie crashes the vehicle; both die, but the emergency crew revives the teen.  Sam is buried in the Marblehead cemetery.<p/><p/>Thirteen years later, Charlie is the caretaker at the Waterside Cemetery where his sibling is buried.  Every night the St. Cloud brothers play catch as Sam delays leaving for heaven.  When Charlie and Tess Carroll meet at the cemetery they are attracted to one another.  She plans to sail around the world solo, but soon after their terrific date, her vessel is lost at sea.  Charlie realizes the rescue team has failed to save her as he watches her spirit fade away while wondering what he can do.<p/><p/>This is a reprint of an engaging character study that focuses on relationships after a loved one dies and how much the living is obligated to deceased loved ones; especially since the person left behind loses a bit of themselves, but more so when they are a catalyst in a tragedy.  The first half is as terrific and insightful a tale as this reviewer has read this year. However, the plot takes a weird turn with a couple of unnecessary twists that add tension, but destroy Sherwoodian after life physics.  Still this is a fabulous tale that focuses on the debt of those alive owe to those who have died as Charlie, Tess and Sam make a fascinating macabre triangle (even if the brothers are Red Sox fans as I am from the Bronx).<p/><p/>Harriet Klausner</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Great Summer Book<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=GatorWorm">GatorWorm</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1401778_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780553584028_BK_1_1401778" href="#previewReview_1401778" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 09, 2010: 
											This book was excellent! It had me interested from the very first page! The characters and story was compelling and made you feel like you were part of the book. It is a tear jerker, and at some moments I did cry. I thought the author did a good job on capturing the emotions of loss and love. Very easy and smooth read, that kept me wanting to read on and on and on. I reccomend this book to anyone.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><i>The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud</i> tells the haunting story of a young man who narrowly survives a terrible car wreck that kills his little brother.

</p><h3>The Washington Post</h3><p>Fans of Sherwood's earlier novel, <i>The Man Who Ate the 747</i>, may enjoy this romantic fantasy of life after death and spirits who remain vigilantly by the sides of the ones they love. Sherwood is an effortless storyteller with a nice rhythm. 


&#151; <i>Susan Adams</i></p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Not even death can keep two brothers from meeting to play ball:  it sounds like a sentimental TV movie, doesn't it? Actually,  Sherwood's second novel (after The Man Who Ate the 747) is  warmhearted but not maudlin, exploring the bonds between the  living and the dead and the lengths to which we'll go for love.  A secret jaunt to a Sox game ends in tragedy when Charlie St.  Cloud, who isn't old enough for a driver's license, crashes the  car he pinched from a neighbor. The hearts of Charlie and his  younger brother, Sam, stop, but miraculously, Charlie is  resuscitated. Thirteen years later, Charlie is 28 and working as  the caretaker for the Marblehead cemetery where Sam is buried;  he's also spending every evening playing catch with the ghost of  12-year-old Sam, who's putting off going to heaven for the game.  Charlie's world gets shaken up, though, by feisty, beautiful  Tess Carroll, a sailor who had plans to be one of the first  women to circumnavigate the globe solo. They have a perfect  date, and sparks fly. But then news comes that her boat is lost  at sea, and Charlie, whose gift of seeing spirits has grown,  realizes that her fading apparition is the result of a failing  effort to rescue her. Sherwood tugs at readers' heartstrings  throughout the novel, and the sentimentality mostly works.  Charlie's final effort to save his lady love from ghostly  oblivion strains credibility, of course, but isn't that the  point of a tale about love triumphant? (Mar. 2)  Forecast: Glowing praise from Nicholas Sparks (he calls  Sherwood's book "everything a wonderful novel should be") should  help convince browsers to buy.

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Two near-death experiences serve as bookends for this initially beguiling second novel about the interactions of the living, the dead, and the in-between. For 15-year-old Charlie St. Cloud and his kid brother Sam, diehard Red Sox fans, Marblehead is the perfect hometown: neighborly and only 30 minutes from Boston's Fenway Park. When Charlie decides to "borrow" a neighbor's car to catch a night game, everything works out fine until he smashes into a tractor-trailer. A paramedic resuscitates him, but can't save Sam. What to do? The devoted Charlie has promised Sam he'll always be there for him. He's able to make good on his word when Sam shows up in the cemetery. A ritual begins: every sundown for the next 13 years, Charlie and Sam meet to play ball. To keep their rendezvous, Charlie becomes the cemetery caretaker and sacrifices career opportunities, while Sam sacrifices his move to the next level of the spirit world. This could be unbearably sappy, but it's not; Sherwood grounds these curious trysts in small-town realities. Eventually a complication arrives: Tess Carroll, expert sailor, preparing for a solo round-the-world race. She runs into Charlie at the cemetery, and they both see stars. Things get serious fast. Should Charlie put Tess before Sam? How much do the living owe the dead? It's a good set-up, but Sherwood ruins it by misdirecting the reader. It turns out Tess herself may be dead. Her sloop is missing, and search-and-rescue missions are underway. Regardless, Tess and Charlie proceed to have sex in an awkward, unsettling scene that borders on necrophilia. Sherwood further fuzzes up the picture by seeming to change the rules that govern human/spirit relations in the middle ofthe game. A disappointing successor to The Man Who Ate the 747 (2000). There's a big audience out there for imaginative treatments of the afterlife (look at The Lovely Bones), provided the author keeps control of the material, which is not the case here.

Though his little brother Sam did not live through the horrific collision on that moonlit night, Charlie has discovered a miraculous way to keep him close. Then Charlie meets Tess, a woman so beautiful and fearless that she makes him yearn to embrace the land of the living once again. But she doesn't realize she's in terrible jeopardy, facing impossible dangers that only Charlie can help her defeat. With a love that transcends everything you may have believed about life and death, Charlie embarks on a spellbinding adventure to save her, and revive his own heart as well.<p>The questions, discussion topics, and author biography that follow are intended to enhance your reading of Ben Sherwood's <i>The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud.</i> We hope they will enrich your experience of this enchanting novel.<p>1. <i>The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud</i> opens with fireman Florio Ferrente's recounting of several lifesaving miracles.  What role does Florio believe Divine intervention plays in his rescue work?  Do you believe in miracles?<p>2. The novel's title and epigraphs capture the notion that conventional definitions of life and death are tremendously limited, and many of the characters find themselves "in between" these realms, literally or figuratively. Which of the book's characters do you perceive as being most alive&#8212;in any sense of the word?<p>3. What does the sustained baseball ritual at sunset between Charlie andSam tell us about the power of love, and fear?<p>4. Discuss the significance of the events leading up to the car accident. Is it possible to explain the true "cause" of the crash?  How do these ideas affect Charlie in the years after that night?<p>5. Compare the various spirits Charlie observes while he's on the job in the cemetery. What seems to determine their demeanor?<p>6. In what ways do Tess and Charlie bear similar emotional scars when they meet? Why does Tess crave self-sufficiency at all costs? What motivates her to set off on such a daunting around-the-world mission?<p>7. Ben Sherwood worked as a television news producer for many years. Do you detect any journalistic influences in the novel, or do you think Sherwood's fiction reflects the opposite of a reporter's point of view?<p>8. How does Charlie's experience and special gift compare with your own beliefs about the afterlife?<p>9. In each character's storyline, what distinctions are made between accident and fate, between chance and destiny? What ultimately saves Tess? From what was Charlie saved?<p>10. The novel contains several bullfighting references, especially in the name of Tess's boat, <i>Querencia</i> (the spot in the ring where the bull feels protected and secure). Why is the matador analogy an apt one for Charlie and Tess? What defines your <i>querencia</i>?<p>11. One of the main characters in Ben Sherwood's previous novel, <i>The Man Who Ate the 747,</i> goes to incredible lengths in a case of unrequited love, while the novel's protagonist finds his life transformed when he unexpectedly meets his soul mate. In what way does <i>The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud </i>enhance and deepen these relationship ideas?<p>12. Although this novel is given a realistic setting and is populated by ordinary men and women, the plot is quite extraordinary. Why did the author choose such an idyllic small-town backdrop?<p>13. What is the effect of ending the novel with a point of view other than Charlie's? Describe Florio's role and approach as narrator. Does Florio's function as storyteller have much in common with his earthly vocation?<p>14. If you were able to visit a lost loved one or friend in the same way Charlie connects with Sam, whom would you like to see?  In the novel, spirits take on an idealized appearance.  How do you think your loved one would appear to you?  How would you spend your time together?<p>15. Sherwood dedicated to this novel to his new wife and to the memory of his father.  In what ways are the ideas of love and loss related?
<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3>ONE<br><br><br><br>CHARLIE ST. CLOUD WASN'T THE BEST OR BRIGHTEST BOY in Essex County, but he was surely the most promising. He was junior-class vice president, shortstop of the Marblehead Magicians, and co-captain of the debate club. With a mischievous dimple on one cheek, nose and forehead freckled from the sun, and caramel eyes hidden beneath a flop of sandy-blond hair, he was already handsome at fifteen. He was a friend to jocks and geeks and even had a girlfriend one year older at school. Yes, Charlie St. Cloud was a blessed boy, quick of mind and body, destined for good things, perhaps even a scholarship at Dartmouth, Princeton, or one of those Ivied places.<br><br>His mother, Louise, cheered his every achievement. Indeed, Charlie was both cause and cure for her own life's disappointments. Those troubles had begun the very moment he was conceived, an unwanted pregnancy that pushed the man she loved--a carpenter with good hands--right out the door. Next came Charlie's obstructed journey into the world, catching somewhere deep inside and requiring bloody surgery to be born. Soon a second son arrived from another vanished father, and the years blurred into one endless struggle. But for all her woes, Charlie erased her pain with those twinkling eyes and optimism. She had grown to depend on him as her angel, her messenger of hope, and he could do no wrong.<br><br>He grew up fast, worked hard at his books, watched out for his mom, and loved his kid brother more than anyone in the world. His name was Sam, and his father--a bail bondsman--was gone, too, barely leaving a trace except for his son's curly brown hair and some bluish bruises on Louise's face. Charlie believed he was the onlytrue protector of his little brother, and someday, together, he knew they would make something of themselves in the world. The boys were three years apart, opposites in coloring and throwing arms, but best friends, united in their love of catching fish, climbing trees, a beagle named Oscar, and the Red Sox.<br><br>Then one day, Charlie made a disastrous decision, a mistake the police could not explain and the juvenile court did its best to overlook.<br><br>To be precise, Charlie ruined everything on Friday, September 20, 1991.<br><br>Mom was working the late shift at Penni's market on Washington Street. The boys had come home from school with mischief on their minds. They had no homework to do until Sunday night. They had already gone spying on the Flynn twins down the block. They had jumped a fence and snuck onto the property of the Czech refugee who claimed to have invented the bazooka. At sunset, they had played catch under the pine trees in their yard on Cloutman's Lane, just as they had done every night since Charlie had given Sam his first Rawlings glove for his seventh birthday. But now it was dark, and they had run out of adventures.<br><br>Sam might have settled for crashing and watching Chris Isaak's &quot;Wicked Game&quot; video on MTV, but Charlie had a surprise. He wanted action and had just the plan.<br><br>&quot;How 'bout night fishing on Devereux Beach?&quot; he asked Sam, setting his brother up perfectly.<br><br>&quot;Boring,&quot; Sam said. &quot;We always do that. How 'bout a movie? Terminator 2's playing at the Warwick. Nick Burridge will sneak us in the back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I've got a better idea.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's R-rated. What's better than that?&quot;<br><br>Charlie pulled out two tickets from the pocket of his jeans jacket. Red Sox tickets. They were playing the Yankees. Boston was on a roll, and the evil Bronx Bombers had lost eleven of their last thirteen.<br><br>&quot;No way! Where'd those come from?&quot; Sam asked.<br><br>&quot;I have my ways.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How we gonna get there? Fly?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don't you worry about that. Mrs. Pung is on vacation. We can borrow her wagon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Borrow? You don't even have a license!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You want to go or not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What about Mom?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don't worry. She'll never know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We can't leave Oscar. He'll freak out and mess up the house.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He can come too.&quot;<br><br>Sure enough, Charlie, Sam, and their beagle were soon driving to Boston in Mrs. Pung's Country Squire. Without their neighbor Mrs. Pung, that is. The police report would make considerable mention of two unlicensed minors, a dog, and a white stolen vehicle with red interior. But Mrs. Pung dropped the auto-theft charges when she got back from Naples, Florida. They were good kids, she said. They only borrowed the car. They made a terrible mistake. They more than paid the price.<br><br>The drive took thirty minutes, and Charlie was especially careful on Route 1A where the Swampscott and Lynn cops patrolled. The boys listened to the pregame show on WRKO, talked about the last time they'd been to the ballpark, and counted their money, calculating they had enough for two Fenway Franks each, a Coke, and peanuts.<br><br>&quot;This is our year,&quot; Sam said. &quot;The Sox'll win the Series.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They just have to break the Curse of the Bambino,&quot; Charlie said. It was the superstition of every red-blooded Boston fan&#58; Trading Babe Ruth to the Yankees had put a hex on the Sox.<br><br>&quot;You don't believe in that stuff, do you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Think about it. The Sox haven't won the Series since 1918. The Yanks have done it twenty-two times. You do the math.&quot;<br><br>&quot;C'mon, the Babe didn't make Bill Buckner boot that ground ball in '86.&quot; Buckner was the reviled first baseman who let an easy dribbler through his legs in the World Series, costing the Sox game six and, many swore, the championship.<br><br>&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He just didn't.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I think he did.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did not.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did too.&quot;<br><br>A standoff.<br><br>&quot;Draw?&quot; Sam said reluctantly.<br><br>&quot;Okay, draw.&quot;<br><br>And with that, the argument was done but not over. A draw was their way of stopping a dispute that would have gone on all night. It would be dutifully recorded in Charlie &amp; Sam's Book of Big &amp; Small Arguments. And after the proper procedural motions, it could be started up again at any point. Ignoring their age difference, Sam threw himself into these arguments with passion, and the two brothers often spent hours in the Abbot public library on Pleasant Street gathering ammunition for their battles.<br><br>Now, with its red bricks and shimmering glass, Boston was waiting across the Charles River. They turned down Brookline Avenue and could see the hazy lights of the stadium. Biting at the chilly air, Oscar leaned out the window. With his red and white coat, he was the perfect mascot for the adventure.<br><br>In the parking lot, the boys stuffed their beagle into a backpack and took off for the bleachers. As they reached their seats a thundering cheer rose for Roger Clemens, #21, throwing his first rocket. The boys laughingly bowed left and right to acknowledge the crowd. A stadium guard would later testify he saw the two unaccompanied youths, wearing caps and carrying mitts, but did not stop or question them.<br><br>Their seats were in right field, directly behind a guy who must have been seven feet tall, but it didn't matter. It could have poured, it could have snowed. Nothing could ruin the spectacle of the Green Monster in left field, the grass, the chalk lines, and the infield dirt. They were right near Pesky's pole, just 302 feet from home plate, easy distance for catching a home run.<br><br>One of their heroes, Wade Boggs, sat out the game with a sore right shoulder, but Jody Reed took his place and delivered, with a run-scoring double and homer off the left-field foul pole. The boys ate two hot dogs each with extra relish. Oscar got some Cracker Jacks from a woman in the next row. A big bearded guy next to her gave them a few sips of Budweiser. Charlie was careful not to drink too much. Still, the police report would mention traces of alcohol in their blood. There was enough to raise questions, but not enough for answers.<br><br>Clemens shut out the Yankees, allowing only three hits and striking out seven. The crowd cheered, and Oscar howled. With the final out and a 2-0 victory in the books, the fans scattered but the boys stayed in their seats, replaying the highlights. The team was now miraculously within striking distance of Toronto. Instead of falling apart in September, always the cruelest month, the Sox were surging.<br><br>&quot;Someday, we'll have season tickets,&quot; Charlie said. &quot;Right there behind home plate in the first row.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The bleachers are good enough for me,&quot; Sam said, eating the last of the peanuts. &quot;I don't care about the seats. As long as it's you and me, that's what makes baseball great.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We'll always play ball, Sam. No matter what.&quot;<br><br>The stadium lights began shutting down. The ground crew had just about spread the tarp over the infield.<br><br>&quot;We better go,&quot; Charlie said.<br><br>The boys headed for the parking lot, where the white station wagon was all alone. The drive home was much faster. Springsteen was born to run on the radio. There was hardly any traffic. The trip would take half an hour. They would be home by 10&#58;30. Mom wouldn't be back until midnight. Mrs. Pung in Florida would never know.<br><br>Just past the Wonderland Greyhound Park, Sam pulled a cassette from his pocket and stuck it in the radio. It was U2's The Joshua Tree. Charlie sang along to &quot;With or Without You.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bono rocks,&quot; Sam said.<br><br>&quot;The Boss.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bono.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Boss.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Draw?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Draw.&quot;<br><br>They drove silently for a while, then Sam asked out of the blue, &quot;How long will it be until I'm grown up?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You already are,&quot; Charlie answered.<br><br>&quot;I'm serious. When do I stop being a kid?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Officially,&quot; Charlie said, &quot;when you're twelve, you're a man and you can do what you want.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Says who?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Says me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm a man and I can do what I want,&quot; Sam said, enjoying the sound of it. A great moon floated on the Saugus River, and he rolled down the window. &quot;Look,&quot; he said. &quot;It's bigger tonight. Must be closer to us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah,&quot; Charlie said. &quot;It's always the same distance. That's just an optical illusion.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What's that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;When your eye plays tricks on you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What kind of trick?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wherever it is in the sky,&quot; Charlie said, &quot;it's always 225,745 miles away.&quot; He did the math. Numbers were easy for him. &quot;At our speed right now, it would take about 170 days to get there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mom wouldn't be too crazy about that,&quot; Sam said.<br><br>&quot;And Mrs. Pung wouldn't be happy about the mileage.&quot;<br><br>The boys laughed. Then Sam said, &quot;It's no optical delusion. It's closer tonight. I swear. Look, you can see a halo just like an angel's.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No such thing,&quot; Charlie said. &quot;That's a refraction of the ice crystals in the upper atmosphere.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gee, I thought it was a refraction of the ice crystals on your butt!&quot; Sam howled with laughter, and Oscar barked in a series of sharp, distinctive woofs.<br><br>Charlie checked his mirrors, aimed the car straight ahead, and took one quick glance to the right. The moon was flickering between the iron railings of the drawbridge, keeping pace with them as they sped home. It sure seemed closer than ever tonight. He turned his head for a better look. He thought the bridge was empty so he pushed down on the gas.<br><br>Of all his reckless decisions that night, surely this was the worst. Charlie raced the moon, and in the final second before the end, he saw the perfect image of happiness. Sam's innocent face looking up at him. The curl dangling over his forehead. The Rawlings glove on his hand. And then there was only fracturing glass, metal, and blackness.<br><br><br><br>TWO<br><br><br><br>WITH A COLD WIND RUSHING THROUGH THE SPANS IN THE General Edwards bridge, Florio Ferrente snatched the jaws of life from the back of his rig. The serrated blades weighed forty-one pounds and could chop through steel, but he wielded them like kitchen scissors in his hulking hands.<br><br>Florio kneeled for a moment and offered the fireman's prayer that came to his lips every time he went to work.<br><br>Give me courage.<br><br>Give me strength.<br><br>Please, Lord, through it all, be at my side.<br><br>Then came the blur of action. One thousand--one million--calculations and considerations. All instantaneous. He evaluated the spilled gasoline and the chance of a spark or explosion. He assessed the fastest way into the wreck--through the windshield, hood, or doors? And he did the math on how much time he had for this rescue. Time, precious time.<br><br>Florio ran past the jagged skid marks and jackknifed tractor trailer. He didn't bother to stop for the truck driver leaning against the center divider. The man's head was in his hands. He reeked of beer and blood. It was one of the rules of rescue&#58; Heaven protects fools and drunks. The guy would be fine.<br><br>The instant license-plate check on the white wagon had produced the first bit of information. The Ford belonged to Mrs. Norman Pung of Cloutman's Lane, Marblehead. Age&#58; 73. Vision-impaired. Perhaps the first clue.<br><br>The vehicle was crunched and tossed upside down, like a cockroach, its front end smashed into the railing of the bridge. He could tell from the trail of glass and metal that the car had rolled at least twice. Florio dropped to the pavement and peered through a squashed window.<br><br>There was no noise inside. No sound of breathing or moaning. Blood trickled through cracks in the metal.<br><br>With swift movements, he jammed a power spreader into the narrow space between the hood and door. A quick flick of his thumb and the hydraulics surged. The car frame groaned as the machine drove the metal apart, clearing a narrow crawl space. Florio pushed his head inside the wreck and saw two boys, upside down, unconscious, tangled in seat belts. Their twisted arms were wrapped around each other in a bloody embrace. No sign of Mrs. Pung.<br><br>&quot;Two traumatic arrests up front,&quot; he shouted to his partner, Trish Harrington. &quot;A dog in back. Scoop and run. Priority One.&quot;<br><br>He slid out of the wreckage and shoved the Hurst tool into the hinges of the door. Another jab of the thumb, and the blades took two powerful bites. Florio pulled the door right off and threw it across the pavement.<br><br>&quot;Gimme two C-spine collars,&quot; he yelled. &quot;And two short backboards.&quot;<br><br>He crawled back inside. &quot;Can you hear me?&quot; he said to the smaller boy. &quot;Talk to me.&quot; No response. No movement. The kid's face and neck were wet with blood, eyes and lips swollen.<br><br>It was another rule of rescue&#58; If the child is quiet, be scared.<br><br>Florio wrapped a brace around the boy's neck, strapped on a backboard, then cut the seat belt with his knife. He lowered the patient gently and pulled him out onto the pavement. He was slight, around eighty pounds, and, incredibly, was still wearing a Rawlings baseball glove on one hand.<br><br>&quot;Pupils are blown,&quot; Florio said, checking with his flashlight. &quot;He's posturing. Blood from the ears.&quot; Bad signs, all. Time to go after the other victim. He climbed back inside. The teenager was pinned beneath the steering column. Florio wedged another spreader into the foot space and hit the hydraulics. As the metal separated, he could see one open fracture of the femur. And he smelled the awful brew of radiator fluid and blood.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>

The ground crew had just about spread the tarp over the infield. <P> "We better go," Charlie said. <P> The boys headed for the parking lot, where the white station wagon was all alone. The drive home was much faster. Springsteen was born to run on the radio. There was hardly any traffic. The trip would take half an hour. They would be home by 10:30. Mom wouldn't be back until midnight. Mrs. Pung in Florida would never know. <P> Just past the Wonderland Greyhound Park, Sam pulled a cassette from his pocket and stuck it in the radio. It was U2's The Joshua Tree. Charlie sang along to "With or Without You." <P> "Bono rocks," Sam said. <P> "The Boss." <P> "Bono." <P> "The Boss." <P> "Draw?" <P> "Draw." <P> They drove silently for a while, then Sam asked out of the blue, "How long will it be until I'm grown up?" <P> "You already are," Charlie answered. <P> "I'm serious. When do I stop being a kid?" <P> "Officially," Charlie said, "when you're twelve, you're a man and you can do what you want." <P> "Says who?" <P> "Says me." <P> "I'm a man and I can do what I want," Sam said, enjoying the sound of it. A great moon floated on the Saugus River, and he rolled down the window. "Look," he said. "It's bigger tonight. Must be closer to us." <P> "Nah," Charlie said. "It's always the same distance. That's just an optical illusion." <P> "What's that?" <P> "When your eye plays tricks on you." <P> "What kind of trick?" <P> "Wherever it is in the sky," Charlie said, "it's always 225,745 miles away." He did the math. Numbers were easy for him. "At our speed right now, it would take about 170 days to get there." <P> "Mom wouldn't be too crazy about that," Sam said. <P> "And Mrs. Pung wouldn't be happy about the mileage." <P> The boys laughed. Then Sam said, "It's no optical delusion. It's closer tonight. I swear. Look, you can see a halo just like an angel's." <P> "No such thing," Charlie said. "That's a refraction of the ice crystals in the upper atmosphere." <P> "Gee, I thought it was a refraction of the ice crystals on your butt!" Sam howled with laughter, and Oscar barked in a series of sharp, distinctive woofs. <P> Charlie checked his mirrors, aimed the car straight ahead, and took one quick glance to the right. The moon was flickering between the iron railings of the drawbridge, keeping pace with them as they sped home. It sure seemed closer than ever tonight. He turned his head for a better look. He thought the bridge was empty so he pushed down on the gas. <P> Of all his reckless decisions that night, surely this was the worst. Charlie raced the moon, and in the final second before the end, he saw the perfect image of happiness. Sam's innocent face looking up at him. The curl dangling over his forehead. The Rawlings glove on his hand. And then there was only fracturing glass, metal, and blackness. <P> <h3> Chapter Two </h3> WITH A COLD WIND RUSHING THROUGH THE SPANS IN THE General Edwards bridge, Florio Ferrente snatched the jaws of life from the back of his rig. The serrated blades weighed forty-one pounds and could chop through steel, but he wielded them like kitchen scissors in his hulking hands. <P> Florio kneeled for a moment and offered the fireman's prayer that came to his lips every time he went to work. <P> Give me courage. <P> Give me strength. <P> Please, Lord, through it all, be at my side. <P> Then came the blur of action. One thousand-one million-calculations and considerations. All instantaneous. He evaluated the spilled gasoline and the chance of a spark or explosion. He assessed the fastest way into the wreck-through the windshield, hood, or doors? And he did the math on how much time he had for this rescue. Time, precious time. <P> Florio ran past the jagged skid marks and jackknifed tractor trailer. He didn't bother to stop for the truck driver leaning against the center divider. The man's head was in his hands. He reeked of beer and blood. It was one of the rules of rescue: Heaven protects fools and drunks. The guy would be fine. <P> The instant license-plate check on the white wagon had produced the first bit of information. The Ford belonged to Mrs. Norman Pung of Cloutman's Lane, Marblehead. Age: 73. Vision-impaired. Perhaps the first clue. <P> The vehicle was crunched and tossed upside down, like a cockroach, its front end smashed into the railing of the bridge. He could tell from the trail of glass and metal that the car had rolled at least twice. Florio dropped to the pavement and peered through a squashed window. <P> There was no noise inside. No sound of breathing or moaning. Blood trickled through cracks in the metal. <P> With swift movements, he jammed a power spreader into the narrow space between the hood and door. A quick flick of his thumb and the hydraulics surged. The car frame groaned as the machine drove the metal apart, clearing a narrow crawl space. Florio pushed his head inside the wreck and saw two boys, upside down, unconscious, tangled in seat belts. Their twisted arms were wrapped around each other in a bloody embrace. No sign of Mrs. Pung. <P> "Two traumatic arrests up front," he shouted to his partner, Trish Harrington. "A dog in back. Scoop and run. Priority One." <P> He slid out of the wreckage and shoved the Hurst tool into the hinges of the door. Another jab of the thumb, and the blades took two powerful bites. Florio pulled the door right off and threw it across the pavement. <P> "Gimme two C-spine collars," he yelled. "And two short backboards." <P> He crawled back inside. "Can you hear me?" he said to the smaller boy. "Talk to me." No response. No movement. The kid's face and neck were wet with blood, eyes and lips swollen. <P> It was another rule of rescue: If the child is quiet, be scared. <P> Florio wrapped a brace around the boy's neck, strapped on a backboard, then cut the seat belt with his knife. He lowered the patient gently and pulled him out onto the pavement. He was slight, around eighty pounds, and, incredibly, was still wearing a Rawlings baseball glove on one hand. <P> "Pupils are blown," Florio said, checking with his flashlight. "He's posturing. Blood from the ears." Bad signs, all. Time to go after the other victim. He climbed back inside. The teenager was pinned beneath the steering column. Florio wedged another spreader into the foot space and hit the hydraulics. As the metal separated, he could see one open fracture of the femur. And he smelled the awful brew of radiator fluid and blood. <P> <I>(Continues...)</I></I> <P> <BR> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud</b> by <b>Ben Sherwood</b> Copyright &copy; 2004 by Ben Sherwood.
