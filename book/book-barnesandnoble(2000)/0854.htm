</p><h3>The New York Times Book Review - 
								Roxana Robinson</h3><p>Dee is at once funny, subversive and sympathetic. In fact, the strange harmonies of his authorial voice, which combines ravishing language, a bleak view of humanity and Dee's own innate good nature, provide much of the novel's interest&#8230;part of Dee's appeal is his sympathy for his characters, and his generous tendency to endow them, no matter how foolish or contemptible, with a certain nobility.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Joseph Finder</h3><p>&#8230;scintillating&#8230;Dee is a remarkably skilled portraitist with a rare talent for rendering his characters' points of view with deep empathy.</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Janet Maslin</h3><p>The Moreys, Cynthia and Adam, have been so disarmingly envisioned by Mr. Dee that they manage to confound expectations&#8230;Mr. Dee illustrates why indirection in this new-money morality tale can be so much more effective than a heavy hand. However alarmed by his characters he may claim to be, he's too smart to give the Moreys the one-note menace-to-society treatment. That leaves <i>The Privileges</i> excessively cryptic, but this story is so invitingly told that it's much easier to be drawn in than turned off.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Dee's four prior novels (Palladio; etc.) cast an intelligent, calculating eye on the culturally topical, which sparked comparisons to the writings of Updike, DeLillo and Franzen. The wedding of Adam and Cynthia Morey, a young and charming couple who quickly expand into a brood of four, begins Dee's fifth. Adam and Cynthia's nuanced personalities and playful, sincere exchanges form the novel's empathic backbone as Adam begins to profit immensely from risky side ventures while working for a hedge fund. Dee establishes a trust with his readers that allows Adam's murky business ethics to escape the spotlight of outright moral scrutiny, and by showing how Adam endangers his privilege&mdash;while his children endanger their own lives&mdash;Dee reveals how risk is a kind of numbing balm. April, Adam's daughter, responds to the boredom of material comfort by resorting to drug-induced self-effacement. The novel climaxes as the children face the possibility of their own death, though lucidity after mortal danger is fleeting&#58; &ldquo;I can feel myself forgetting what it feels like to feel,&rdquo; April says. Dee notably spurns flat portraits of greed, instead letting the characters' self-awareness and self-forgetfulness stand on their own to create an appealing portrait of a world won by risk. (Jan.)
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Dee's latest novel (after Palladio) is a scathing portrait of the perks and perils of a life of privilege. Cynthia and Adam Morey are a golden couple&mdash;beautiful, ambitious, untouchable. From their wedding in their early twenties, to raising two children in Manhattan, to Adam's rise in the financial world, they exude a self-absorbed confidence, and their commitment to each other shines. Yet Adam's relentless insider trading and lack of conscience are pathological. Daughter April is aimless and abuses drugs, while son Jonas eschews his trust fund and attends art school. In a twisted and bizarre sideplot, he comes running back to the safety of his privileged life after a near-death experience. Dee excels at detailing contemporary scenes, delivering pitch-perfect dialog, and crafting brutal, hard-to-forget interactions, as when Cynthia coldly buys off her dying father's girlfriend in order to spend a few last hours with the man who deserted her as a child. VERDICT Readers who appreciate complex characters with questionable morality will enjoy discussing this stylish work. [Library marketing; ebook available 1/10&#58; ISBN 978-1-58836-920-8.]&mdash;Christine Perkins, Bellingham P.L., WA
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Gilded young go-getter creates, not always legally, a cocoon for his family in Dee's mostly buoyant fifth novel about money, family and mortality. Adam and Cynthia Morey, Midwestern transplants in Manhattan, have beauty, brains, charm and a formidable determination to carve out a comfortable world for themselves, though they do not come from money; Adam's father was a pipe fitter. The couple, married when they're only 22, have some simple rules. Forget the past. Seize the day. Keep in shape. Glow! Two kids, April and Jonas, arrive early; no problem. Adam has the Midas touch and the trust of his boss at his private-equity firm. Honoring complexity, Dee (Palladio, 2002, etc.) refuses to paint Adam as a total narcissist or philanderer. Unlike his peer Sherman McCoy in Bonfire of the Vanities, Adam has a doglike devotion to his wife, the stronger character. They dote on their kids; family means this charmed circle of four. Everyone else is an outsider. When her stepsister has a breakdown, Cynthia dumps her like somebody else's garbage. Dee tracks the Moreys over 20-plus years as they strive for a life without limits. Their sex life still sizzles; aging is forbidden; their money keeps growing, helped by Adam's involvement in insider trading, a risk he enjoys. Still, we ignore limits and connectedness at our peril, and that's Dee's theme, implied without glib moralizing. The novel's final third turns darker. Both parents are frantically busy, heavily involved in charity work; they're boldface names, with their own foundation. Then Cynthia takes a time out; her dad is dying in a Florida hospice and she feels uncharacteristically bereft. The pampered college-age kids appear trapped. April isspiraling downward; drugs, meaningless sex. Jonas, an art student and half-hearted rebel against his family's values, almost loses his life to a madman because of his lack of survival skills.

The first of a generation; the bride and groom are&#160;just twenty- two, young to be married these days. Most of their&#160;friends flew in yesterday, and though they are in Pittsburgh, a city of&#160;half a million, they affect a good- natured snobbish disorientation,&#160;because they come from New York and Chicago but also because it&#160;suits their sense of the whole event, the magical disquieting novelty&#160;of it, to imagine that they are now in the middle of nowhere. They&#160;have all, of course, as children or teenagers, sat through the wedding&#160;of some uncle or cousin or in quite a few cases their own&#160;mother or father, so they know in that sense what to expect. But this&#160;is their first time as actual friends and contemporaries of the betrothed;&#160;and the strange, anarchic exuberance they feel is tied to a&#160;fear that they are being pulled by surrogates into the world of responsible&#160;adulthood, a world whose exit will disappear behind&#160;them and for which they feel proudly unready. They are adults pretending&#160;to be children pretending to be adults. Last night&rsquo;s rehearsal&#160;dinner ended with the overmatched restaurant manager threatening&#160;to call the police. The day to come shapes up as an unstable compound&#160;of camp and import. Nine hours before they&rsquo;re due at the&#160;church, many of them are still sleeping, but already the thick old&#160;walls of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club seem to hum with a lordly overenthusiasm.<br><br>&#160;Mid- September. Since Labor Day, the western half of Pennsylvania&#160;has been caught in a late and dispiriting heat wave. Cynthia&#160;wakes up inher mother&rsquo;s house, in a bed she&rsquo;s awakened in only five&#160;or six times in her life, and her first thought is for the temperature.&#160;She pulls on a t- shirt in case anyone else is awake, passes her burdensome&#160;stepsister Deborah (never Debbie) sleeping in flannel pajamas&#160;half on and half off the living room couch, and slides open the&#160;door to the deck, from which she can see in the distance a few limp&#160;flags on the golf course at Fox Chapel. Cool, tolerably cool anyway,&#160;though it&rsquo;s still too early to tell anything for sure. It can&rsquo;t even be&#160;seven yet, she thinks. Not that she&rsquo;s worried. The specter of her&#160;bridesmaids holding beer bottles to their foreheads to cool off, or of&#160;Adam wiping the sweat out of his eyes as he promises himself to her,&#160;only makes her smile. She&rsquo;s not the type to fold if things don&rsquo;t go&#160;perfectly; what matters most to her is that the day be one that nobody&#160;who knows her will ever forget, a day her friends will tell stories&#160;about. She turns and heads back indoors, past her own fading&#160;footprints in the heavy dew on the cedar planks of the deck.<br><br>&#160;She never imagined a wedding in Pittsburgh, because she never&#160;had any reason to imagine it until her mother remarried and moved&#160;out here two years ago. To the extent she&rsquo;d pictured it at all, Cynthia&#160;had always assumed she&rsquo;d be married back in Joliet Park&#58; but in the&#160;middle of her last semester at Colgate she learned that her father had&#160;sold their old house there, in which he had not lived for a long time;&#160;and when she announced her engagement two months later her&#160; mother Ruth went off on one of her unpacifiable jags about Cynthia&rsquo;s&#160;stepfather Warren being &ldquo;a part of this family&rdquo; and would not&#160;stand for any implication that this was less than entirely true. To&#160;force- march these outsize personalities back to the scene of the family&rsquo;s&#160;dissolution in Joliet Park, to listen to them bitch over the seating&#160;chart and over old friends whose post- divorce allegiances were&#160;sometimes painfully ambiguous, was out of the question. It would&#160;have been a gruesome sort of nostalgia, and pointless at that. A wedding&#160;is rightfully about the future if it is about anything at all.<br><br>&#160;They could have married in New York&mdash;where Cynthia and&#160;Adam already shared an apartment&mdash;and in fact that was the&#160;arrangement Adam gently pushed for, on the grounds, typically&#160;male, of maximum simplicity. But the truth was that that wouldn&rsquo;t&#160;have seemed unusual enough to Cynthia, too little distinct from a&#160;typical Saturday night out drinking and dancing with their friends,&#160;just with fancier clothes and a worse band. She wasn&rsquo;t completely&#160;sure why the idea should appeal to her at all&mdash;the big schmaltzy&#160;wedding, the sort of wedding for which everyone would have to&#160;make travel plans&mdash;but she didn&rsquo;t make a habit of questioning her&#160;wants. So Pittsburgh it was. Adam shrugged and said he only cared&#160;about making her happy; her father sent her a lovely note from&#160;wherever he was living now, implying that the whole idea had been&#160;his to begin with; and Warren expressed himself by opening up his&#160;checkbook, a consequence, to tell the truth, of which Cynthia had&#160;not been unmindful.<br><br>&#160;She tiptoes past the couch to avoid waking Deborah, because&#160;waking her might cause her to speak, and on one&rsquo;s wedding day&#160;there are some trials one ought to be spared. They don&rsquo;t know each&#160;other that well, but little things about Deborah excite Cynthia&rsquo;s derision&#160;as though they have lived together for years. The flannel pajamas,&#160;for instance&#58; she is two years older than Cynthia but so&#160;congenitally chilly that she and Ruth might as well be roommates at&#160;the old folks&rsquo; home. The house was bought with a second life in&#160;mind, a life in which the children were grown and gone, which explains&#160;why there is only one spare bedroom. Though the couch&#160;looks gratifyingly uncomfortable, Cynthia considered a campaign&#160;to pack Deborah off to the Athletic Club with all the other guests,&#160;so that her maid of honor and best friend, Marietta, could stay at&#160;the house instead. But family obligations are perverse. It makes no&#160;sense at all that this palpably hostile sexless geek should be one of&#160;her bridesmaids, and one of Cynthia&rsquo;s many close friends&rsquo; feelings&#160;hurt as a result; yet here she is.<br><br><br>&#160;In the kitchen Ruth, Cynthia&rsquo;s mother, whose last name is now&#160;Harris, is drinking a cup of tea standing up, in a green ankle- length&#160;bathrobe she holds closed at the neck. Cynthia passes her and opens&#160;the refrigerator without a word. &ldquo;Warren&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; Ruth says, in answer&#160;to a question it would not occur to Cynthia to ask. &ldquo;He went&#160;to get you some coffee. We only keep decaf in the house, so he went&#160;out specially for you.&rdquo;<br><br>&#160;Cynthia scowls at the effrontery of decaf coffee, a fetish of the&#160;old and joyless. Tossing a loaf of bread on the counter, she stands on&#160;tiptoe to search the cupboard where she remembers the ancient jams&#160;are kept; then, feeling her mother&rsquo;s gaze, she turns her head to look&#160;back over her shoulder and says, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br><br>&#160;It&rsquo;s the underwear&#58; the fact that she is parading around in it, but&#160;also the underwear itself, the unhomeliness of it, the fact that her&#160;daughter has grown into a woman whom it pleases to spend a lot of&#160;money on underwear. Shameless is the word for it. All Ruth wants&#160;is a little gravitas for today of all days, a proper sense of nervousness&#160;or even fear, which she might then think of some way to allay.&#160;One last moment of reliance. But no&#58; it became clear weeks ago that&#160;all this was no rite of passage into womanhood for her daughter&mdash;&#160;it&rsquo;s a party, a big party for her and all her friends, and she and Warren&#160;are just there to pick up the tab. For the last six or eight years,&#160;nearly every sight of her daughter has caused a certain look to cross&#160;Ruth&rsquo;s face, a look of just- you- wait, though the question &ldquo;wait for&#160;what?&rdquo; is not one she could answer and thus she keeps her mouth&#160;shut. The flatness of Cynthia&rsquo;s stomach, the strength and narrowness&#160;of her hips, more than anything the way she carries herself with&#160;such immodesty in a body whose nearness to the modern ideal is&#160;bound to provoke an unpredictable range of response&#58; self- satisfied&#160;women are often brought low in this world, and for years now,&#160;mostly by frowning, Ruth has tried to sneak her insights onto the&#160;record.<br><br>&#160;But she reprimands herself; today, no matter who cares to deny&#160;it, is not just any day. She feels the faint echo of her own terror in&#160;the hours before her first wedding, a terror that was partly sexual,&#160;which counts as a bond between them even though her daughter&rsquo;s&#160;sexuality is a subject she has long since lost the fortitude to go near.&#160;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she says, trying for a conciliatory tone. &ldquo;This is your special&#160;day.&rdquo; And Cynthia turns around, mouth open, and laughs&mdash;a laugh&#160;Ruth has heard before, the only solace for which is a retreat into&#160;memories of when her only child was a baby.&#160;<br><br>Behind them, the digital clock on the microwave blinks silently&#160;to seven- thirty. In the living room, Deborah, having woken herself&#160;with her own snoring, makes a little groaning sound that no one&#160;hears and pushes her face deeper into the gap between the cushions&#160;and the sofa back. At the Athletic Club, the weekend desk clerk consults&#160;the computer printout in her hand and dials the extension for&#160;Adam&rsquo;s room. She&rsquo;s seen the Daily Events schedule and recognizes&#160;his name as that of the groom; to the scripted wake- up greeting at&#160;the top of the printout she adds best wishes of her own, because she&#160;saw him last night and he&rsquo;s cute.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Adam says, and hangs up. He too goes straight to the&#160;window to check the weather. His window faces the alley, though;&#160;he&rsquo;ll probably get a better sense of the day&rsquo;s prospects from the TV.&#160;He turns it on with the sound down but then lies back on the bed,&#160;fingers laced behind his head, and forgets to watch.&#160;<br><br>He hates sleeping alone and maybe for that reason he spent the&#160;minutes before the phone rang in an extravagant dream, a dream&#160;about driving a car with no steering wheel in it, a car that responded&#160;to his slightest weight shifts, like a skateboard or a sled.&#160;<br><br>One hour until breakfast in the hotel restaurant with his parents&#160;and his younger brother and best man, Conrad. Having thought of&#160;this, he tries to forget it again so that he can be genuinely blameless&#160;if he shows up late. He&rsquo;s a little hung over from the rehearsal dinner,&#160;though others, he reflects, will have cause to be a whole lot more&#160;hung over than he. Too early to call Cynthia, who&rsquo;s probably still&#160;asleep. What would really calm him down is sex with her&mdash;as it is&#160;he starts most mornings that way; it scatters the vague anxieties&#160;with which he wakes&mdash;but today that&rsquo;s not going to happen. With&#160;sudden inspiration he arches his back and pounds on the wall above&#160;his headboard, the wall his room shares with the room where Conrad&#160;is staying.&#160;<br><br>Conrad doesn&rsquo;t hear; up for an hour already, he is standing in the&#160;shower practicing his toast. It was the only duty that gave him any&#160;pause at all when he accepted the best- man role. He blushes and&#160;shakes whenever he has to speak in public; and how relatively easy&#160;it would be to pull this off in front of a ballroom full of strangers, as&#160;opposed to friends and family with their license for pitiless longterm&#160;teasing, people before whom there is no question of pretending&#160;even for a few minutes that he is anyone other than who he is.&#160;&ldquo;They are a charmed couple,&rdquo; he says, because this is a phrase&#160;over which he&rsquo;s stumbled in earlier rehearsals; and it&rsquo;s too late now&#160;for a rewrite. &ldquo;They are a charmed chouple. Fuck.&rdquo; And he starts&#160;from the beginning.&#160;<br><br>Waking in the other rooms on the second and third floor of the&#160;Athletic Club are friends of the bride and groom&mdash;couple friends,&#160;friends who have brought especially serious or promising dates&mdash;&#160;almost all of whom find themselves acting, at that hour, on a sexual&#160;impulse that&rsquo;s unsettlingly strong even for the bloom of youth. Some&#160;are laughing, and some stare into their partners&rsquo; eyes with an urgency&#160;the memory of which will have them avoiding each other&rsquo;s&#160;gaze an hour later. They are not used to the licentiousness of hotel&#160;rooms; and the knowledge that on this particular weekend they&#160;have not just infiltrated this stuffy club but taken it over gives a subterraneous&#160;group sense to each intimate encounter, a sense of orgy&#160;that makes them want to offend strangers, to exert themselves until&#160;the walls of that place come down.&#160;<br><br>Indeed there is one couple that knocks the headboard against the&#160;wall behind Adam&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; bed so loudly that his mother just&#160;prays she doesn&rsquo;t know them. She even tells her husband to call the&#160;front desk and complain, but he&rsquo;s in the bathroom and hears, as a&#160;rule, what he chooses to hear.&#160;<br><br>At eight- thirty Marietta&rsquo;s car rolls into the Harrises&rsquo; driveway.&#160;Inside the kitchen she and the still undressed Cynthia kiss like sisters;&#160;&ldquo;Jesus, it&rsquo;s fucking hot out there,&rdquo; Marietta says. &ldquo;Oh hi, Mrs.&#160;Sikes. I mean Mrs. Harris!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s more than Ruth can bear; she smiles&#160;premonitorily and withdraws from the kitchen.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;So shall we go do the hair thing?&rdquo; Marietta says, but then all of&#160;a sudden Deborah is in the doorway, hair matted, face pebbled from&#160;the rough upholstery of the couch, looking at them both with tribal&#160;hatred.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Your phone&rsquo;s ringing,&rdquo; she says to her stepsister, and turns and&#160;leaves.&#160;<br><br>The phone is on the bedroom floor, underneath the jacket Cynthia&#160;wore to the rehearsal dinner. Marietta follows her through the&#160;living room.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Thanks for bringing it to me, there, Debski,&rdquo; says Cynthia,&#160;though Deborah has disappeared into the bathroom. &ldquo;So, you&#160;didn&rsquo;t bring your dress? Where is it?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;In the freezer,&rdquo; Marietta says.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be such a baby. Haven&rsquo;t you heard? It&rsquo;s my Special&#160;Day.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s my point. You&rsquo;re the bride. Still well within your&#160;power to change the whole dress code to, like, beach casual.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Wear a tank top to your own wedding, slut,&rdquo; Cynthia says.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how we roll here in Pittsburgh.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that not- so- fresh feeling,&rdquo; Marietta says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m&#160;saying.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>In his chair watching CNN as they pass behind him, Warren&#160;hears all this and, though he would still like to be a kind of father to&#160;this young woman, knows that for the moment the only dignified&#160;course is to pretend that he is not even in the room at all.&#160;<br><br>Cynthia smiles at Marietta and takes the phone out on the deck.&#160;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this bad luck?&rdquo; she says, sliding the door shut behind her.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I saw your dad in the lobby last night,&rdquo; Adam says. &ldquo;I recognized&#160;him from his picture. He seemed in pretty good form. Have&#160;you called him yet?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says, and her heart races a little bit. &ldquo;I will in a while.&#160;Hey, what time is it?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Quarter to four.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Very funny. I mean aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be at breakfast with&#160;your parents?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t leave Conrad alone with them, for God&rsquo;s sake. You&#160;know how they get. Plus he&rsquo;s got the rings so let&rsquo;s not antagonize&#160;him.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Adam smiles, waiting for the elevator in the empty hotel corridor.&#160;&ldquo;Can you believe we&rsquo;re doing this?&rdquo; he says.&#160;<br><br>The boards on the deck are already burning her feet. &ldquo;Not too&#160;late to back out,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re calling.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Well, I still have seven hours to think about it, right?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Me too. Tell you what, if I&rsquo;m not there by, let&rsquo;s say, ten of four,&#160;you just go ahead and assume I&rsquo;m not coming, okay?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Fair enough. Seeing how everything&rsquo;s paid for and all, if you&#160;don&rsquo;t show I&rsquo;ll just wave one of the bridesmaids up and marry her.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Which one you have your eye on?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>There is a pause. &ldquo;I missed you when I woke up this morning,&rdquo;&#160;he says.&#160;<br><br>Her view of the golf course from earlier that morning has now&#160;been erased by haze. She closes her eyes. &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You&#160;won&rsquo;t forget pictures, right?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Two- fifteen in the Trophy Room. Conrad&rsquo;s carrying around a&#160;little schedule.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;See you then. Enjoy your last few hours of&#160;freedom.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Gotta go,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The hookers are here.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>She hangs up on him, smiling. In the living room, Marietta&#160;stands uncomfortably, while Deborah, back on the couch, watches&#160;her like a guard dog, like some emissary from the underworld of the&#160;socially damned. Marietta can read her hatred only as jealousy,&#160;which softens her own attitude a bit.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she says, and remembers that Deborah is a graduate student&#160;somewhere, in something. &ldquo;School is good?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Adam strolls into the hotel dining room and sees that his parents,&#160;sitting with a stricken- looking Conrad, have ordered their breakfast&#160;but not touched it. They missed their connection in New York yesterday&#160;and arrived too late to make it to the rehearsal dinner, which&#160;may have been just as well. He kisses his mother on the top of her&#160;head. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your room?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Everything to your liking?&rdquo;&#160;Adam&rsquo;s father makes a sarcastic noise, which his mother recognizes and preemptively talks over. <br><br>&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Very comfortable. You have to point out Cynthia&rsquo;s parents to me so we can&#160;say thank you.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>The two sets of parents have never met. There didn&rsquo;t seem much&#160;point to it. &ldquo;Marietta made it home okay last night?&rdquo; Adam asks&#160;Conrad. Conrad nods but does not stop eating, because he would&#160;very much like to get this breakfast over with. Adam signals the&#160;waitress for coffee. He hasn&rsquo;t really looked at either of his parents&#160;since he sat down. No one is looking at Mr. Morey, though he seems&#160;to be mysteriously gathering himself nonetheless, like a clock about&#160;to strike. Two heart attacks have hunched his shoulders in the way&#160;of a man much older than he actually is. Up in the room are four&#160;portable oxygen tanks, in case he needs them, and in the purse at his&#160;wife&rsquo;s feet are various pills and phone numbers. But his short temper&#160;and unregulated resentments suggest that his physical failings&#160;are a kind of natural outgrowth of his personality, and everyone&#160;who knows him, mindful of his angry pride, is unsolicitous toward&#160;him. He is tormented by the efflorescence of foolishness and waste&#160;of all kinds, everywhere around him. He was a pipe fitter who became&#160;a full- time union executive until his disabilities forced him to&#160;retire. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club is exactly the kind of place that&#160;sets him off. His wife has made him put on a coat and tie for breakfast&#160;even though she will now have to hear about it for the next&#160;month.&#160;<br><br>But Adam is not embarrassed by them in this setting, as his&#160;brother is, because he doesn&rsquo;t really associate them all that closely&#160;with himself anymore. He is amused by their helpless compulsion to&#160;be themselves, and will wind them up like a music box at any opportunity.&#160;&ldquo;Hey, you know what I found in my room?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In&#160;the dresser drawer? A list of room rates. Did you guys see that? Do&#160;you have any idea what this place <i>costs</i>?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, Adam, <i>please,</i>&rdquo; his mother whispers, &ldquo;today of all&mdash;&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;As it happens, I did,&rdquo; his father says, reddening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad&#160;I&rsquo;m not the sap paying for all this.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;More reason to be glad we never had girls,&rdquo; his mother says,&#160;and laughs as if she were being filmed laughing.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t have made a damn bit of difference to me,&rdquo; Mr.&#160;Morey says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to put on a show for anybody. I don&rsquo;t pretend&#160;to be anything I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Adam abruptly stands up. &ldquo;Oh look, there&rsquo;s Mr. Sikes,&rdquo; he says.&#160;&ldquo;Excuse me. I&rsquo;m gonna go practice calling him Dad.&rdquo; And he&#160;crosses the room to where the bride&rsquo;s dapper father sits at a table by&#160;himself, reading the paper. Conrad watches him leave in disbelief.&#160;His parents stare accusingly at each other. A moment later the waitress&#160;comes by and fills Adam&rsquo;s coffee cup.&#160;<br><br>The doors to the hotel ballroom are shut, and behind them, in&#160;moments of silence, one can hear the vacuum cleaners run. Teenage&#160;girls in stiff black skirts walk from table to table, checking the place&#160;settings, counting on their fingers. They work slowly; the air conditioning&#160;is turned up all the way, and with the room not yet full of&#160;bodies it is exotically cold, the coldest place in the hotel. Only those&#160;most desperate for a cigarette pass through the double doors to the&#160;infernal kitchen and the steaming alley beyond.&#160;<br><br>At the hotel bar sits the wedding planner, habitually early, having&#160;sent her son and his friend to the florist&rsquo;s in her van, praying they&#160;haven&rsquo;t stopped to get high along the way. It&rsquo;s why she doesn&rsquo;t pay&#160;them in advance. The bar isn&rsquo;t officially open yet but Masha knows&#160;everyone at the Athletic Club; this will be her fourth reception there&#160;this year. Though it&rsquo;s before noon, she feels like (as her father used to&#160;say) a <i>drink </i>drink, and Omar the bartender would certainly comp&#160;her one, but while she&rsquo;s on the job alcohol is out of the question.&#160;Something like that gets out and your reputation is shot. True, the&#160;bride&mdash;whose superior attitude Masha doesn&rsquo;t especially care for&mdash;&#160;isn&rsquo;t even from Pittsburgh and acts as if she might never set foot here&#160;again after today; but the stepfather, whose name is on the checks, is&#160;some rainmaker at Reed Smith, and the mother, whose superior attitude&#160;she doesn&rsquo;t much care for either, is one of those chronically unsatisfied&#160;types who love nothing better than to nurse along some&#160;scandal, substantiated or otherwise.&#160;<br><br>But that&rsquo;s the secret to Masha&rsquo;s success&#58; you get invested not in&#160;the people, who can let you down, but in the ceremony, which never&#160;does. She doesn&rsquo;t say it out loud very often but she thinks of herself as a guardian of something, a finger in the dike holding back total&#160;indifference toward the few things that have always mattered, ritual&#160;and devotion and commitment. When you thought of it that way,&#160;the less you happened to care for the families themselves, the more&#160;noble your work became. Her own marriage ended after nine years,&#160;but that detracted in no way from the beautiful memory of her wedding&#160;day itself; in fact, that&rsquo;s what you were left with, she thinks,&#160;that and a beloved if somewhat less than reliable son. Besides, if it&#160;were up to her they would all still be together, husband and wife and&#160;child, through happy and contentious times alike. But not everything&#160;is her decision.&#160;

The first of a generation; the bride and groom are&#160;just twenty- two, young to be married these days. Most of their&#160;friends flew in yesterday, and though they are in Pittsburgh, a city of&#160;half a million, they affect a good- natured snobbish disorientation,&#160;because they come from New York and Chicago but also because it&#160;suits their sense of the whole event, the magical disquieting novelty&#160;of it, to imagine that they are now in the middle of nowhere. They&#160;have all, of course, as children or teenagers, sat through the wedding&#160;of some uncle or cousin or in quite a few cases their own&#160;mother or father, so they know in that sense what to expect. But this&#160;is their first time as actual friends and contemporaries of the betrothed;&#160;and the strange, anarchic exuberance they feel is tied to a&#160;fear that they are being pulled by surrogates into the world of responsible&#160;adulthood, a world whose exit will disappear behind&#160;them and for which they feel proudly unready. They are adults pretending&#160;to be children pretending to be adults. Last night&rsquo;s rehearsal&#160;dinner ended with the overmatched restaurant manager threatening&#160;to call the police. The day to come shapes up as an unstable compound&#160;of camp andimport. Nine hours before they&rsquo;re due at the&#160;church, many of them are still sleeping, but already the thick old&#160;walls of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club seem to hum with a lordly overenthusiasm.<br><br>&#160;Mid- September. Since Labor Day, the western half of Pennsylvania&#160;has been caught in a late and dispiriting heat wave. Cynthia&#160;wakes up in her mother&rsquo;s house, in a bed she&rsquo;s awakened in only five&#160;or six times in her life, and her first thought is for the temperature.&#160;She pulls on a t- shirt in case anyone else is awake, passes her burdensome&#160;stepsister Deborah (never Debbie) sleeping in flannel pajamas&#160;half on and half off the living room couch, and slides open the&#160;door to the deck, from which she can see in the distance a few limp&#160;flags on the golf course at Fox Chapel. Cool, tolerably cool anyway,&#160;though it&rsquo;s still too early to tell anything for sure. It can&rsquo;t even be&#160;seven yet, she thinks. Not that she&rsquo;s worried. The specter of her&#160;bridesmaids holding beer bottles to their foreheads to cool off, or of&#160;Adam wiping the sweat out of his eyes as he promises himself to her,&#160;only makes her smile. She&rsquo;s not the type to fold if things don&rsquo;t go&#160;perfectly; what matters most to her is that the day be one that nobody&#160;who knows her will ever forget, a day her friends will tell stories&#160;about. She turns and heads back indoors, past her own fading&#160;footprints in the heavy dew on the cedar planks of the deck.<br><br>&#160;She never imagined a wedding in Pittsburgh, because she never&#160;had any reason to imagine it until her mother remarried and moved&#160;out here two years ago. To the extent she&rsquo;d pictured it at all, Cynthia&#160;had always assumed she&rsquo;d be married back in Joliet Park&#58; but in the&#160;middle of her last semester at Colgate she learned that her father had&#160;sold their old house there, in which he had not lived for a long time;&#160;and when she announced her engagement two months later her&#160;mother Ruth went off on one of her unpacifiable jags about Cynthia&rsquo;s&#160;stepfather Warren being &ldquo;a part of this family&rdquo; and would not&#160;stand for any implication that this was less than entirely true. To&#160;force- march these outsize personalities back to the scene of the family&rsquo;s&#160;dissolution in Joliet Park, to listen to them bitch over the seating&#160;chart and over old friends whose post- divorce allegiances were&#160;sometimes painfully ambiguous, was out of the question. It would&#160;have been a gruesome sort of nostalgia, and pointless at that. A wedding&#160;is rightfully about the future if it is about anything at all.<br><br>&#160;They could have married in New York&mdash;where Cynthia and&#160;Adam already shared an apartment&mdash;and in fact that was the&#160;arrangement Adam gently pushed for, on the grounds, typically&#160;male, of maximum simplicity. But the truth was that that wouldn&rsquo;t&#160;have seemed unusual enough to Cynthia, too little distinct from a&#160;typical Saturday night out drinking and dancing with their friends,&#160;just with fancier clothes and a worse band. She wasn&rsquo;t completely&#160;sure why the idea should appeal to her at all&mdash;the big schmaltzy&#160;wedding, the sort of wedding for which everyone would have to&#160;make travel plans&mdash;but she didn&rsquo;t make a habit of questioning her&#160;wants. So Pittsburgh it was. Adam shrugged and said he only cared&#160;about making her happy; her father sent her a lovely note from&#160;wherever he was living now, implying that the whole idea had been&#160;his to begin with; and Warren expressed himself by opening up his&#160;checkbook, a consequence, to tell the truth, of which Cynthia had&#160;not been unmindful.<br><br>&#160;She tiptoes past the couch to avoid waking Deborah, because&#160;waking her might cause her to speak, and on one&rsquo;s wedding day&#160;there are some trials one ought to be spared. They don&rsquo;t know each&#160;other that well, but little things about Deborah excite Cynthia&rsquo;s derision&#160;as though they have lived together for years. The flannel pajamas,&#160;for instance&#58; she is two years older than Cynthia but so&#160;congenitally chilly that she and Ruth might as well be roommates at&#160;the old folks&rsquo; home. The house was bought with a second life in&#160;mind, a life in which the children were grown and gone, which explains&#160;why there is only one spare bedroom. Though the couch&#160;looks gratifyingly uncomfortable, Cynthia considered a campaign&#160;to pack Deborah off to the Athletic Club with all the other guests,&#160;so that her maid of honor and best friend, Marietta, could stay at&#160;the house instead. But family obligations are perverse. It makes no&#160;sense at all that this palpably hostile sexless geek should be one of&#160;her bridesmaids, and one of Cynthia&rsquo;s many close friends&rsquo; feelings&#160;hurt as a result; yet here she is.<br><br><br>&#160;In the kitchen Ruth, Cynthia&rsquo;s mother, whose last name is now&#160;Harris, is drinking a cup of tea standing up, in a green ankle- length&#160;bathrobe she holds closed at the neck. Cynthia passes her and opens&#160;the refrigerator without a word. &ldquo;Warren&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; Ruth says, in answer&#160;to a question it would not occur to Cynthia to ask. &ldquo;He went&#160;to get you some coffee. We only keep decaf in the house, so he went&#160;out specially for you.&rdquo;<br><br>&#160;Cynthia scowls at the effrontery of decaf coffee, a fetish of the&#160;old and joyless. Tossing a loaf of bread on the counter, she stands on&#160;tiptoe to search the cupboard where she remembers the ancient jams&#160;are kept; then, feeling her mother&rsquo;s gaze, she turns her head to look&#160;back over her shoulder and says, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br><br>&#160;It&rsquo;s the underwear&#58; the fact that she is parading around in it, but&#160;also the underwear itself, the unhomeliness of it, the fact that her&#160;daughter has grown into a woman whom it pleases to spend a lot of&#160;money on underwear. Shameless is the word for it. All Ruth wants&#160;is a little gravitas for today of all days, a proper sense of nervousness&#160;or even fear, which she might then think of some way to allay.&#160;One last moment of reliance. But no&#58; it became clear weeks ago that&#160;all this was no rite of passage into womanhood for her daughter&mdash;&#160;it&rsquo;s a party, a big party for her and all her friends, and she and Warren&#160;are just there to pick up the tab. For the last six or eight years,&#160;nearly every sight of her daughter has caused a certain look to cross&#160;Ruth&rsquo;s face, a look of just- you- wait, though the question &ldquo;wait for&#160; what?&rdquo; is not one she could answer and thus she keeps her mouth&#160;shut. The flatness of Cynthia&rsquo;s stomach, the strength and narrowness&#160;of her hips, more than anything the way she carries herself with&#160;such immodesty in a body whose nearness to the modern ideal is&#160;bound to provoke an unpredictable range of response&#58; self- satisfied&#160;women are often brought low in this world, and for years now,&#160;mostly by frowning, Ruth has tried to sneak her insights onto the&#160;record.<br><br>&#160;But she reprimands herself; today, no matter who cares to deny&#160;it, is not just any day. She feels the faint echo of her own terror in&#160;the hours before her first wedding, a terror that was partly sexual,&#160;which counts as a bond between them even though her daughter&rsquo;s&#160;sexuality is a subject she has long since lost the fortitude to go near.&#160;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she says, trying for a conciliatory tone. &ldquo;This is your special&#160;day.&rdquo; And Cynthia turns around, mouth open, and laughs&mdash;a laugh&#160;Ruth has heard before, the only solace for which is a retreat into&#160;memories of when her only child was a baby.&#160;<br><br>Behind them, the digital clock on the microwave blinks silently&#160;to seven- thirty. In the living room, Deborah, having woken herself&#160;with her own snoring, makes a little groaning sound that no one&#160;hears and pushes her face deeper into the gap between the cushions&#160;and the sofa back. At the Athletic Club, the weekend desk clerk consults&#160;the computer printout in her hand and dials the extension for&#160;Adam&rsquo;s room. She&rsquo;s seen the Daily Events schedule and recognizes&#160;his name as that of the groom; to the scripted wake- up greeting at&#160;the top of the printout she adds best wishes of her own, because she&#160;saw him last night and he&rsquo;s cute.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Adam says, and hangs up. He too goes straight to the&#160;window to check the weather. His window faces the alley, though;&#160;he&rsquo;ll probably get a better sense of the day&rsquo;s prospects from the TV.&#160;He turns it on with the sound down but then lies back on the bed,&#160;fingers laced behind his head, and forgets to watch.&#160;<br><br>He hates sleeping alone and maybe for that reason he spent the&#160;minutes before the phone rang in an extravagant dream, a dream&#160;about driving a car with no steering wheel in it, a car that responded&#160;to his slightest weight shifts, like a skateboard or a sled.&#160;<br><br>One hour until breakfast in the hotel restaurant with his parents&#160;and his younger brother and best man, Conrad. Having thought of&#160;this, he tries to forget it again so that he can be genuinely blameless&#160;if he shows up late. He&rsquo;s a little hung over from the rehearsal dinner,&#160;though others, he reflects, will have cause to be a whole lot more&#160;hung over than he. Too early to call Cynthia, who&rsquo;s probably still&#160;asleep. What would really calm him down is sex with her&mdash;as it is&#160;he starts most mornings that way; it scatters the vague anxieties&#160;with which he wakes&mdash;but today that&rsquo;s not going to happen. With&#160;sudden inspiration he arches his back and pounds on the wall above&#160;his headboard, the wall his room shares with the room where Conrad&#160;is staying.&#160;<br><br>Conrad doesn&rsquo;t hear; up for an hour already, he is standing in the&#160;shower practicing his toast. It was the only duty that gave him any&#160;pause at all when he accepted the best- man role. He blushes and&#160;shakes whenever he has to speak in public; and how relatively easy&#160;it would be to pull this off in front of a ballroom full of strangers, as&#160;opposed to friends and family with their license for pitiless longterm&#160;teasing, people before whom there is no question of pretending&#160;even for a few minutes that he is anyone other than who he is.&#160;&ldquo;They are a charmed couple,&rdquo; he says, because this is a phrase&#160;over which he&rsquo;s stumbled in earlier rehearsals; and it&rsquo;s too late now&#160;for a rewrite. &ldquo;They are a charmed chouple. Fuck.&rdquo; And he starts&#160;from the beginning.&#160;<br><br>Waking in the other rooms on the second and third floor of the&#160;Athletic Club are friends of the bride and groom&mdash;couple friends,&#160;friends who have brought especially serious or promising dates&mdash;&#160;almost all of whom find themselves acting, at that hour, on a sexual&#160;impulse that&rsquo;s unsettlingly strong even for the bloom of youth. Some&#160;are laughing, and some stare into their partners&rsquo; eyes with an urgency&#160;the memory of which will have them avoiding each other&rsquo;s&#160;gaze an hour later. They are not used to the licentiousness of hotel&#160;rooms; and the knowledge that on this particular weekend they&#160;have not just infiltrated this stuffy club but taken it over gives a subterraneous&#160;group sense to each intimate encounter, a sense of orgy&#160;that makes them want to offend strangers, to exert themselves until&#160;the walls of that place come down.&#160;<br><br>Indeed there is one couple that knocks the headboard against the&#160;wall behind Adam&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; bed so loudly that his mother just&#160;prays she doesn&rsquo;t know them. She even tells her husband to call the&#160;front desk and complain, but he&rsquo;s in the bathroom and hears, as a&#160;rule, what he chooses to hear.&#160;<br><br>At eight- thirty Marietta&rsquo;s car rolls into the Harrises&rsquo; driveway.&#160;Inside the kitchen she and the still undressed Cynthia kiss like sisters;&#160;&ldquo;Jesus, it&rsquo;s fucking hot out there,&rdquo; Marietta says. &ldquo;Oh hi, Mrs.&#160;Sikes. I mean Mrs. Harris!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s more than Ruth can bear; she smiles&#160;premonitorily and withdraws from the kitchen.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;So shall we go do the hair thing?&rdquo; Marietta says, but then all of&#160;a sudden Deborah is in the doorway, hair matted, face pebbled from&#160;the rough upholstery of the couch, looking at them both with tribal&#160;hatred.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Your phone&rsquo;s ringing,&rdquo; she says to her stepsister, and turns and&#160;leaves.&#160;<br><br>The phone is on the bedroom floor, underneath the jacket Cynthia&#160;wore to the rehearsal dinner. Marietta follows her through the&#160;living room.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Thanks for bringing it to me, there, Debski,&rdquo; says Cynthia,&#160;though Deborah has disappeared into the bathroom. &ldquo;So, you&#160;didn&rsquo;t bring your dress? Where is it?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;In the freezer,&rdquo; Marietta says.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be such a baby. Haven&rsquo;t you heard? It&rsquo;s my Special&#160;Day.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s my point. You&rsquo;re the bride. Still well within your&#160;power to change the whole dress code to, like, beach casual.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Wear a tank top to your own wedding, slut,&rdquo; Cynthia says.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how we roll here in Pittsburgh.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that not- so- fresh feeling,&rdquo; Marietta says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m&#160;saying.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>In his chair watching CNN as they pass behind him, Warren&#160;hears all this and, though he would still like to be a kind of father to&#160;this young woman, knows that for the moment the only dignified&#160;course is to pretend that he is not even in the room at all.&#160;<br><br>Cynthia smiles at Marietta and takes the phone out on the deck.&#160;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this bad luck?&rdquo; she says, sliding the door shut behind her.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I saw your dad in the lobby last night,&rdquo; Adam says. &ldquo;I recognized&#160;him from his picture. He seemed in pretty good form. Have&#160;you called him yet?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says, and her heart races a little bit. &ldquo;I will in a while.&#160;Hey, what time is it?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Quarter to four.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Very funny. I mean aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be at breakfast with&#160;your parents?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t leave Conrad alone with them, for God&rsquo;s sake. You&#160;know how they get. Plus he&rsquo;s got the rings so let&rsquo;s not antagonize&#160;him.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Adam smiles, waiting for the elevator in the empty hotel corridor.&#160;&ldquo;Can you believe we&rsquo;re doing this?&rdquo; he says.&#160;<br><br>The boards on the deck are already burning her feet. &ldquo;Not too&#160;late to back out,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re calling.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Well, I still have seven hours to think about it, right?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Me too. Tell you what, if I&rsquo;m not there by, let&rsquo;s say, ten of four,&#160;you just go ahead and assume I&rsquo;m not coming, okay?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Fair enough. Seeing how everything&rsquo;s paid for and all, if you&#160;don&rsquo;t show I&rsquo;ll just wave one of the bridesmaids up and marry her.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Which one you have your eye on?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>There is a pause. &ldquo;I missed you when I woke up this morning,&rdquo;&#160;he says.&#160;<br><br>Her view of the golf course from earlier that morning has now&#160;been erased by haze. She closes her eyes. &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You&#160;won&rsquo;t forget pictures, right?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Two- fifteen in the Trophy Room. Conrad&rsquo;s carrying around a&#160;little schedule.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;See you then. Enjoy your last few hours of&#160;freedom.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Gotta go,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The hookers are here.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>She hangs up on him, smiling. In the living room, Marietta&#160;stands uncomfortably, while Deborah, back on the couch, watches&#160;her like a guard dog, like some emissary from the underworld of the&#160;socially damned. Marietta can read her hatred only as jealousy,&#160;which softens her own attitude a bit.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she says, and remembers that Deborah is a graduate student&#160;somewhere, in something. &ldquo;School is good?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Adam strolls into the hotel dining room and sees that his parents,&#160;sitting with a stricken- looking Conrad, have ordered their breakfast&#160;but not touched it. They missed their connection in New York yesterday&#160;and arrived too late to make it to the rehearsal dinner, which&#160;may have been just as well. He kisses his mother on the top of her&#160;head. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your room?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Everything to your liking?&rdquo;&#160;Adam&rsquo;s father makes a sarcastic noise, which his mother recognizes and preemptively talks over. <br><br>&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Very comfortable. You have to point out Cynthia&rsquo;s parents to me so we can&#160;say thank you.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>The two sets of parents have never met. There didn&rsquo;t seem much&#160;point to it. &ldquo;Marietta made it home okay last night?&rdquo; Adam asks&#160;Conrad. Conrad nods but does not stop eating, because he would&#160;very much like to get this breakfast over with. Adam signals the&#160;waitress for coffee. He hasn&rsquo;t really looked at either of his parents&#160;since he sat down. No one is looking at Mr. Morey, though he seems&#160;to be mysteriously gathering himself nonetheless, like a clock about&#160;to strike. Two heart attacks have hunched his shoulders in the way&#160;of a man much older than he actually is. Up in the room are four&#160;portable oxygen tanks, in case he needs them, and in the purse at his&#160;wife&rsquo;s feet are various pills and phone numbers. But his short temper&#160;and unregulated resentments suggest that his physical failings&#160;are a kind of natural outgrowth of his personality, and everyone&#160;who knows him, mindful of his angry pride, is unsolicitous toward&#160;him. He is tormented by the efflorescence of foolishness and waste&#160;of all kinds, everywhere around him. He was a pipe fitter who became&#160;a full- time union executive until his disabilities forced him to&#160;retire. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club is exactly the kind of place that&#160;sets him off. His wife has made him put on a coat and tie for breakfast&#160;even though she will now have to hear about it for the next&#160;month.&#160;<br><br>But Adam is not embarrassed by them in this setting, as his&#160;brother is, because he doesn&rsquo;t really associate them all that closely&#160;with himself anymore. He is amused by their helpless compulsion to&#160;be themselves, and will wind them up like a music box at any opportunity.&#160;&ldquo;Hey, you know what I found in my room?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In&#160;the dresser drawer? A list of room rates. Did you guys see that? Do&#160;you have any idea what this place <i>costs</i>?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, Adam, <i>please,</i>&rdquo; his mother whispers, &ldquo;today of all&mdash;&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;As it happens, I did,&rdquo; his father says, reddening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad&#160;I&rsquo;m not the sap paying for all this.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;More reason to be glad we never had girls,&rdquo; his mother says,&#160;and laughs as if she were being filmed laughing.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t have made a damn bit of difference to me,&rdquo; Mr.&#160;Morey says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to put on a show for anybody. I don&rsquo;t pretend&#160;to be anything I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;&#160; <br><br>Adam abruptly stands up. &ldquo;Oh look, there&rsquo;s Mr. Sikes,&rdquo; he says.&#160;&ldquo;Excuse me. I&rsquo;m gonna go practice calling him Dad.&rdquo; And he&#160;crosses the room to where the bride&rsquo;s dapper father sits at a table by&#160;himself, reading the paper. Conrad watches him leave in disbelief.&#160;His parents stare accusingly at each other. A moment later the waitress&#160;comes by and fills Adam&rsquo;s coffee cup.&#160;<br><br>The doors to the hotel ballroom are shut, and behind them, in&#160;moments of silence, one can hear the vacuum cleaners run. Teenage&#160;girls in stiff black skirts walk from table to table, checking the place&#160;settings, counting on their fingers. They work slowly; the air conditioning&#160;is turned up all the way, and with the room not yet full of&#160;bodies it is exotically cold, the coldest place in the hotel. Only those&#160;most desperate for a cigarette pass through the double doors to the&#160;infernal kitchen and the steaming alley beyond.&#160;<br><br>At the hotel bar sits the wedding planner, habitually early, having&#160;sent her son and his friend to the florist&rsquo;s in her van, praying they&#160;haven&rsquo;t stopped to get high along the way. It&rsquo;s why she doesn&rsquo;t pay&#160;them in advance. The bar isn&rsquo;t officially open yet but Masha knows&#160;everyone at the Athletic Club; this will be her fourth reception there&#160;this year. Though it&rsquo;s before noon, she feels like (as her father used to&#160;say) a <i>drink </i>drink, and Omar the bartender would certainly comp&#160;her one, but while she&rsquo;s on the job alcohol is out of the question.&#160;Something like that gets out and your reputation is shot. True, the&#160;bride&mdash;whose superior attitude Masha doesn&rsquo;t especially care for&mdash;&#160;isn&rsquo;t even from Pittsburgh and acts as if she might never set foot here&#160;again after today; but the stepfather, whose name is on the checks, is&#160;some rainmaker at Reed Smith, and the mother, whose superior attitude&#160;she doesn&rsquo;t much care for either, is one of those chronically unsatisfied&#160;types who love nothing better than to nurse along some&#160;scandal, substantiated or otherwise.&#160;<br><br>But that&rsquo;s the secret to Masha&rsquo;s success&#58; you get invested not in&#160;the people, who can let you down, but in the ceremony, which never&#160;does. She doesn&rsquo;t say it out loud very often but she thinks of herself as a guardian of something, a finger in the dike holding back total&#160;indifference toward the few things that have always mattered, ritual&#160;and devotion and commitment. When you thought of it that way,&#160;the less you happened to care for the families themselves, the more&#160;noble your work became. Her own marriage ended after nine years,&#160;but that detracted in no way from the beautiful memory of her wedding&#160;day itself; in fact, that&rsquo;s what you were left with, she thinks,&#160;that and a beloved if somewhat less than reliable son. Besides, if it&#160;were up to her they would all still be together, husband and wife and&#160;child, through happy and contentious times alike. But not everything&#160;is her decision.&#160; <BR><BR><i>Continues...</i> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>The Privileges</b> by <b>Jonathan Dee</b> Copyright &copy; 2010 by Jonathan Dee.
