											Once past the horrifying thought of being cast adrift in a lifeboat with a tiger with only one waking thought that is to eat you, the story becomes charming. The stream of consciousness of a genteel adolescent Indian boy, the son of a zoo keeper, who must resort to savagery himself to survive is heart-wrenching. Martel's mastery of the language, vivid description and cryptic observations about the good and evil in all of us holds the reader entranced even though the situation is absurd. Pi finally lands on an island where the only living creatures are markeets and carnivorous plants. He is forced to set himself, and his tiger, adrift again. Based upon a true incident, we are not sure what is true and what is not. The opening line is "My suffering left me sad and gloomy." The overall affect of the events in the book left me feeling the same way. It is a bitter-sweet, yet brilliant read.<p/>www.lindaballouauthor.com<p/>Lost Angel Walkabout-One Traveler's Tales<p/>Wai-nani, High Chiefess of Hawaii</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35703668.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Yann Martel</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Montreal, Quebec, Canada</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>June 25, 1963</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Salamanca, Spain</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A. in philosophy, Trent University, Ontario, 1986</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>2002 winner of the Booker Prize, for <i>Life of Pi</i>; 2001 Hugh MacLennan Prize for fiction, Quebec Writers� Federation; 1993 Gold Medal for Fiction, National Magazine Awards</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Sometime in the early 1990s, Yann Martel stumbled across a critique in <I>The New York Times Review of Books</I> by John Updike that captured his curiosity. Although Updike's response to Moacyr Scliar's <I>Max and the Cats</I> was fairly icy and indifferent, the premise immediately intrigued Martel. According to Martel, <I>Max and the Cats</I> was, "as far as I can remember... about a zoo in Berlin run by a Jewish family. The year is 1933 and, not surprisingly, business is bad. The family decides to emigrate to Brazil. Alas, the ship sinks and one lone Jew ends up in a lifeboat with a black panther." Whether or not the story was as uninspiring as Updike had indicated in his review, Martel was both fascinated by this premise and frustrated that he had not come up with it himself. <p>    Ironically, Martel's account of the plot of <I>Max and the Cats</I> wasn't completely accurate. In fact, in Scliar's novel, Max Schmidt did not belong to a family of zookeepers -- he was the son of furrier. Furthermore, he did not emigrate from Berlin to Brazil with his family as the result of a failing zoo, but was forced to flee Hamburg after his lover's husband sells him out to the Nazi secret police. So, this plot that so enthralled Martel -- which he did not pursue for several years because he assumed Moacyr Scliar had already tackled it -- was more his own than he had thought. <p>    Meanwhile, Martel managed to write and publish two books: a collection of short stories titled <I>The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios</I> in 1993 and a novel about gender confusion called <I>Self</I> in 1996. Both books sold only moderately well, further frustrating the writer. In an effort to collect his thoughts and refresh his creativity, he took a trip to India, first spending time in bustling Bombay. However, the overcrowded city only furthered Martel's feelings of alienation and dissolution. He then decided to move on to Matheran, a section near Bombay but without that city's dense population. In this peaceful hill station overlooking the city, Martel began revisiting an idea he had not considered in some time, the premise he had unwittingly created when reading Updike's review in <I>The New York Times Review of Books</I>. He developed the idea even further away from <I>Max and the Cats</I>. While Scliar's novel was an extended holocaust allegory, Martel envisioned his story as a witty, whimsical, and mysterious meditation on zoology and theology. Unlike Max Schmidt, Pi Patel would, indeed, be the son of a zookeeper. Martel would, however, retain the shipwrecked-with-beasts theme from <I>Max and the Cats</I>. During an ocean exodus from India to Canada, the ship sinks and Pi finds himself stranded on a lifeboat with such unlikely shipmates as a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. <p>    The resulting novel, <I>Life of Pi</I>, became the smash-hit for which Martel had been longing. Selling well over a million copies and receiving the accolades of <I>Book Magazine</I>, <I>Publisher's Weekly</I>, <I>Library Journal</I>, and, yes, <I>The New York Times Review of Books</I>, <I>Life of Pi</I> has been published in over 40 countries and territories, in over 30 languages. It is currently in production by Fox Studios with a script by master-of-whimsy Jean-Pierre Jeunet (<I>City of Lost Children</I>; <I>Am�lie</I>) and directorial duties to be handled by Alfonso Cuar�n (<I>Y tu mam� tambi�n</I>; <I>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</I>). <p>    Martel is now working on his third novel, a bizarrely allegorical adventure about a donkey and a monkey that travel through a fantastical world... on a shirt. Well, at least no one will ever accuse him of borrowing that premise from any other writer. <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b><I>Life of Pi</I> is not Yann Martel's first work to be adapted for the screen. </b> His short story "Manners of Dying" was made into a motion picture by fellow Canadian resident Jeremy Peter Allen in 2004.<P>    <b>When he isn't penning modern masterpieces, </b> Martel spends much of his time volunteering in a palliative care unit.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>In 2002, Yann Martel took time to answer some of our questions</i>. <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life?</b><br>  I would say <i>Le Petit Chose</i>, by the French writer Alphonse Daudet. It was the first book to make me cry. I was around ten years old. It made me see how powerful words could be, how much we could see and feel through mere black jottings on a page. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><Br>  In no particular order, off the top of my head:<ul>  <li><i>The Divine Comedy</i>, by Dante. Simply an amazing book. As complex and detailed as a Gothic cathedral, yet as simple and emotionally direct as a little girl's kiss on your cheek. If there's one book that captures an entire age and people and mentality -- that of Italy in the year 1300 -- it is the Divine Comedy.   <li>The short stories of Franz Kafka. Weird and revealing, like holding up a mirror to the darker parts of ourselves.   <li><i>Hunger</i>, by the Norwegian Knut Hamsun. The odyssey of a man wandering the streets of Oslo, lost and starving. My first taste of the appeal of alienation.  <li><i>The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea</i>, by the Japanese Yukio Mishima. A simple perfect story, with the scary inevitability of a guillotine coming down.   <li><i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> (and also the short stories), by the much maligned Hemingway. For the style, that simple, lucid style that says so much with so little.   <li><i>Dead Souls</i>, by Gogol. Funny, strange, outrageous.   <li><i>The Death of Ivan Illyich</i>, (or anything else) by Tolstoy. Fearless writing: utterly modern, incredibly wise, technically flawless. A true genius, that Count Leo.   <li><i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, by Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez. As magic as life, if only we would let ourselves dream....  <li>Most anything by Willa Cather. An unfairly neglected writer.  <li> My own next book. Don't mean to be pretentious here, or to rate my modest talents higher than they are. Nonetheless, it's the truth. My next book -- each one while I'm working on it -- dances in my mind and thrills me at every turn. If it didn't, why would I write it?  </ul>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <ul><li><i>The Idiots</i>, directed by Lars von Trier  <li><i>Dark Eyes</i>, by Nikita Mikhalkov   <li><i>Korzak</i>, by Andrzej Wajda  <li><i>Rien sur Robert</i>, by Pascal Bonitzer  <li><i>The Tin Drum</i>, by Volker Schlondorf  <li><i>The Deerhunter</i>, by Michael Cimino  </ul>  These are movies that have had a real emotional impact on me. But I also like grand entertainments like:   <ul><li><i>Lady and the Tramp</i> and <i>The Aristocats</i>, by Walt Disney  <li>The Pink Panther movies  <li> Science fiction movies</ul>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  Music moves me -- duh -- and that is like having a window opening on a heightened reality, but the effect is fleeting: When the music ends, the magic, the uplifting, vanishes and the window slams shut. Words, on the other hand, by the nature of how they work, emotions evoked by dint of carefully laid out thoughts, have a more lingering effect. So I'd say that nothing has moved me more than music, but it carries the taint of escapism and I rate it lower than dry words. That said, I love the usual suspects, from Bach to Brel.<p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  A fat classic I've never been able to read on my own, like <I>The Magic Mountain</I> or <I>� la Recherche du Temps Perdu</i>. They're long, detailed, complex novels, the equivalent of visiting a big, old European city -- so why not have company for the visit? I figure there would be much to discuss reading these books. <p>    Another great book to do would be Dante's <I>Divine Comedy</i>. Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, a thousand characters and their thousand punishments or rewards, a travelogue like you've never imagined, Renaissance Italy, love, hate, etc., etc., etc. -- what more could you ask of a book? <p>    Books are something social -- a writer speaking to a reader -- so I think making the  reading of a book the centre of a social event, the meeting of a book club, is a brilliant idea. May books spread the world over! <p>     <b>Who are your favorite writers, and what makes their writing special?</b><br>  I've partly answered this in the question about my favourite books, but I'd add Joseph Conrad, Thomas Hardy, a handful of First World War poets, Sinclair Lewis, and others that I forget at the moment. As you can tell, I'm hopelessly out of step with my time.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers</b><br>Though all of our volunteer readers weighed in with "two thumbs up," we knew this was a winner when our fiction buyer -- not given to hyperbole -- declared it "one of the best books I've ever read!"  Yann Martel's <i>Life of Pi</i> deserves every word of that praise.  Drawing parallels between zoology and theology, Martel's novel is by turns amusing, intellectually astute, and poignant.  And his Kiplingesque adventure tale will cause readers to reexamine beliefs of all kinds.<p>

Meet Pi Patel, a young man on the cusp of adulthood when fate steps in and hastens his lessons in maturity.  En route with his family from their home in India to Canada, their cargo ship sinks, and Pi finds himself adrift in a lifeboat -- alone, save for a few surviving animals, some of the very same animals Pi's zookeeper father warned him would tear him to pieces if they got a chance.  But Pi's seafaring journey is about much more than a struggle for survival.  It becomes a test of everything he's learned -- about both man and beast, their creator, and the nature of truth itself. <p>  

With a brilliant combination of sensitivity and a precise economy of language, Martel develops a story some readers might find less than credible.  But his capacity for the mysterious, and a true understanding of the depths of human resilience will compel even the most skeptical of readers to continue on the fantastic journey with Pi, and an unusual 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  <i>(Summer 2002 Selection)</i>
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>In October 2005 a worldwide competition was launched to find an artist to illustrate Yann Martel&#8217;s international bestseller. Media partners included <i>The Globe and Mail</i> in Canada, <i>The Times</i> in the UK and <i>The Age</i> in Australia, with an international panel of judges that included Canadians Martin Levin, Books Editor of <i>The Globe and Mail,</i> Executive Publisher Louise Dennys and Random House of Canada Creative Director C.S. Richardson. From thousands of entries, Croatian artist Tomislav Torjanac was chosen as the illustrator for this new edition of <b>Life of Pi</b>.</p><h3>L'Humanite</h3><p>Let me tell you a secret&#58; the name of the greatest living writer of the generation born in the sixties is Yann Martel.
</p><h3>Albterto Manguel</h3><p>Those who would believe that the art of fiction is moribund-let them read Yann Martel with astonishment, delight, and gratitude.
</p><h3>Globe And Mail</h3><p>Pi is Martel's triumph. He is understated and ironic, utterly believable and pure. The whole fantastic voyage carries hints of The Old Man And The Sea. The playfulness adds another layer to an already strong story.
</p><h3>The New Yorker</h3><p>An impassioned defense of zoos, a death-defying trans-Pacific sea adventure &agrave; la "Kon-Tiki," and a hilarious shaggy-dog story starring a four-hundred-and-fifty-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker: this audacious novel manages to be all of these as it tells the improbable survivor's tale of Pi Patel, a young Indian fellow named for a swimming pool (his full first name is Piscine) who endures seven months in a lifeboat with only a hungry, outsized feline for company. This breezily aphoristic, unapologetically twee saga of man and cat is a convincing hands-on, how-to guide for dealing with what Pi calls, with typically understated brio, "major lifeboat pests."</p><h3>Book Magazine</h3><p>A work of wonder, this novel tells a fabulous tale about an intrepid sixteen-year-old boy who spends 227 days at sea with a 450-pound Bengal tiger. The protagonist is a dreamer and a desperado, a zookeeper's son steeped in animal lore and religion (he's a practicing Hindu, Muslim and Catholic). A young Canadian with a Pushcart Prize to his credit, Martel is a limpid stylist with a flair for the poetic. Mainly, however, he's a storyteller&#151;and a brilliant one. There are echoes in his work of Latin American magic realism (reminiscent of Garc&#237;a M&#225;rquez and Borges) and touches of absurdist mind games. A cross-cultural feast, the book ranges from India to North America; it's also packed with curious disquisitions on philosophy, zoology, linguistics and God. But in the end, it's the story you'll remember, the kind of twist-and-turns spellbinder that's almost impossible to forget.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>A fabulous romp through an imagination by turns ecstatic,  cunning, despairing and resilient, this novel is an impressive  achievement "a story that will make you believe in God," as one  character says. The peripatetic Pi (n  the much-taunted Piscine)  Patel spends a beguiling boyhood in Pondicherry, India, as the  son of a zookeeper. Growing up beside the wild beasts, Pi  gathers an encyclopedic knowledge of the animal world. His  curious mind also makes the leap from his native Hinduism to  Christianity and Islam, all three of which he practices with  joyous abandon. In his 16th year, Pi sets sail with his family  and some of their menagerie to start a new life in Canada.  Halfway to Midway Island, the ship sinks into the Pacific,  leaving Pi stranded on a life raft with a hyena, an orangutan,  an injured zebra and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard  Parker. After the beast dispatches the others, Pi is left to  survive for 227 days with his large feline companion on the  26-foot-long raft, using all his knowledge, wits and faith to  keep himself alive. The scenes flow together effortlessly, and  the sharp observations of the young narrator keep the tale brisk  and engaging. Martel's potentially unbelievable plot line soon  demolishes the reader's defenses, cleverly set up by events of  young Pi's life that almost naturally lead to his biggest  ordeal. This richly patterned work, Martel's second novel, won  Canada's 2001 Hugh MacLennan Prize for Fiction. In it, Martel  displays the clever voice and tremendous storytelling skills of  an emerging master. Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.

								VOYA</h3><p>It sounds like the start of a bad joke: A boy, a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger are stranded on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific. The format makes it clear from the beginning who survives, but it is the how that propels the reader, as Pi's voice emerges with an as-told-to memoir quality that relays the tale of a young man who explores a variety of faiths and learns much about human nature through watching the animals at his father's zoo. Everything he discovers through his observations becomes applicable in the oceanic adventure that takes place after the sinking of the ship carrying his family and a few select specimens from the zoo toward a better life in North America. Although ordinarily science and religion are at odds, the lessons learned through spirituality and biology become Pi's salvation. The novel takes an allegorical twist when Pi reveals that his highly imaginative tale of animals corresponds to a more horrific one, peopled with family and crew from the sunken ship. The plot hooks, the writing is vivid, and the tone is engaging after a slow start. Although the gore and physicality are not for the weak of stomach or faint of heart, teens who enjoy reading to learn something about the world around them or themselves will delight in this Booker Prize-winning novel.

Deciding to immigrate to  Canada, his father sells off most of the zoo animals, electing  to bring a few along with the family on their voyage to their  new home. But after only a few days out at sea, their rickety  vessel encounters a storm. After crew members toss Pi overboard  into one of the lifeboats, the ship capsizes. Not long after, to  his horror, Pi is joined by Richard Parker, an acquaintance who  manages to hoist himself onto the lifeboat from the roiling sea.  You would think anyone in Pi's dire straits would welcome the  company, but Richard Parker happens to be a 450-pound Bengal  tiger. It is hard to imagine a fate more desperate than Pi's: "I  was alone and orphaned, in the middle of the Pacific, hanging on  to an oar, an adult tiger in front of me, sharks beneath me, a  storm raging about me." At first Pi plots to kill Richard  Parker. Then he becomes convinced that the tiger's survival is  absolutely essential to his own. In this harrowing yet inspiring  tale, Martel demonstrates skills so well honed that the story  appears to tell itself without drawing attention to the writing.  This second novel by the Spanish-born, award-winning author of  Self, who now lives in Canada, is highly recommended for all  fiction as well as animal and adventure collections.

</p><h3>The Nation</h3><p>If Canadian writer Yann Martel were a preacher, he'd be charismatic,
funny and convert all the non-believers.  He baits his readers with serious
themes and trawls them through a sea of questions and confusion, but he
makes one laugh so much, and at times feel so awed and chilled, that even
thrashing around in bewilderment or disagreement one can't help but be
captured by his prose. &#151;Charlotte Innes</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A fable about the consolatory and strengthening powers of religion flounders about somewhere inside this unconventional coming-of-age tale, which was shortlisted for Canada's Governor General's Award. The story is told in retrospect by Piscine Molitor Patel (named for a swimming pool, thereafter fortuitously nicknamed "Pi"), years after he was shipwrecked when his parents, who owned a zoo in India, were attempting to emigrate, with their menagerie, to Canada. During 227 days at sea spent in a lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger (mostly with the latter, which had efficiently slaughtered its fellow beasts), Pi found serenity and courage in his faith: a frequently reiterated amalgam of Muslim, Hindu, and Christian beliefs. The story of his later life, education, and mission rounds out, but does not improve upon, the alternately suspenseful and whimsical account of Pi's ordeal at sea-which offers the best reason for reading this otherwise preachy and somewhat redundant story of his Life.</p><br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-custreview" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="loader" id="BK_9780156030205"><img alt="loading..." title="loading..." src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif"> Loading...</div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-fulldetails" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>Product Details</h3><div class="product-list-info"><div class="col-one"><ul><li class="pubDate">Pub.

But by the end of my adolescent years I had struck out being an astronaut and a politician, and at university I eventually struck out everything a bachelor&#8217;s degree could deliver, from archaeology to zoology &#8211; each chosen at one point or another because of the pageant and drama they seemed to promise. I was 19 years old and desperate. I was wasting my time at university, didn&#8217;t belong there, but was terrified of the working world. So, I wrote. The first thing I wrote was a play. It was a very, very bad play &#8211; the story of a young man who falls in love with a door and commits suicide when a well-meaning friend chops his beloved up to pieces and uses her as firewood, I kid you not &#8211; but there was joy in the creating, a thrill in putting characters on a stage and giving them lines. I wrote another equally bad play, then switched to prose, which I thought would suit me better. I proceeded to write a number of bad short stories. I didn&#8217;t show them to anyone. I was too embarrassed. Still, each time, it was the same: to play with words, to construct sentences, to create situations, to invent characters and dialogue, was something I found deeply exciting and fulfilling and that I could do hour after hour, day after day. I continued writing, not knowing why or where it would lead me. I never thought of it as a <i>career</i> &#8211; and still don&#8217;t now.<br><br><b>2) What inspired you to write this particular book? Is there a story about the writing of this novel that begs to be told?</b><br><br>I would guess that most books come from the same mix of threeelements: influence, inspiration and hard work. Let me detail how each one came into play in the writing of <b>Life of Pi</b>.<br><br><b>Influence</b>: Ten or so years ago, I read a review by John Updike in the<i> New York Times Review of Books</i>. It was of a novel by a Brazilian writer I&#8217;d never heard of, Moacyr Scliar. I forget the title, and John Updike did worse: he clearly thought the book as a whole was forgettable. His review &#8211; one of those that makes you suspicious by being mostly descriptive, without critical teeth, as if the reviewer were holding back &#8211; oozed indifference. The story, as far as I can remember, was about a zoo in Berlin run by a Jewish family. The year is 1933 and, not surprisingly, business is bad. The family decides to emigrate, to Brazil. Alas, the ship sinks and one lone Jew ends up in a lifeboat with a black panther. What could displease Updike about such a story? Was it that the allegory marched with too heavy a tread, the parallel between the black panther and the Nazis too obvious? Did the premise wear its welcome out? Was it the tone? The style? The translation? Whatever it was, the book fatigued Updike, but it had the effect on my imagination of electric caffeine. I marvelled. What perfect unity of time, action and place. What stark, rich simplicity. Oh, the wondrous things I could do with this premise. I felt that same mix of envy and frustration I had felt with Mishima&#8217;s <b>The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea</b>, that if only I had thought of it I could have done something great with it. But &#8211; damn! &#8211; the idea had been faxed to the wrong muse. I looked for the book. It was nowhere to be found in Montreal. I chose not to order it. I didn&#8217;t really want to read it anyway. Why put up with the gall? Why put up with a brilliant premise ruined by a lesser writer. Worse, what if Updike had been wrong? What if not only the premise but also its rendition were perfect? Best to move on. I wrote my first novel. I travelled. Romances started and ended. I travelled some more. Four or five years went by.<br><br><b>Inspiration</b>: I was in India. It was my second time. The start of the trip had been rough. I had arrived in Bombay. I felt terribly lonely. One night I sat on my bed and wept, muffling the sounds so that my neighbours would not hear me through the thin walls. Where was my life going? Nothing about it seemed to have started or added up to much. I had written two books that had sold about a thousand copies each. I had neither family nor career to show for my thirty-four years on Earth. And if that weren&#8217;t enough, the novel I had planned to write while in India had died. Every writer knows the feeling. A story is born in your mind and it thrills you. You nurture it like you would a fire. You hope to see it grow and eventually be born on paper. But at one point, you look at it and you feel nothing. You feel no pulse. The characters don&#8217;t speak naturally, the plot does not move, the descriptions don&#8217;t come to you &#8211; everything about your story is thankless work. It has died.<br><br>I was in need of a story. More than that, I was in need of a Story.<br><br>I got to Matheran, the hill station closest to Bombay. It&#8217;s a small place high up, with beautiful views over the surrounding plains, and it has the peculiarity of not being able to accommodate cars, autorickshaws or motorcycles. You get there by toy train or by taxi, and then you must walk or ride a horse. The closest you get to the noises of a motor on Matheran&#8217;s streets are the rumbling, horking sounds of Indians spewing out betel juice. The peace of the place is blessed and utterly un-Indian. It was there, on top of a big boulder to be precise, that I remembered Scliar&#8217;s premise.<br><br>Suddenly, my mind was exploding with ideas. I could hardly keep up with them. In jubilant minutes whole portions of the novel emerged fully formed: the lifeboat, the animals, the intermingling of the religious and the zoological, the parallel stories. I was telling myself the story as I created it.<br><br>I now had a reason to be in India.<br><br><b>Hard work</b>: I visited all the zoos I could find in the south of India. I interviewed the director of the Trivandrum Zoo. I spent time in temples, churches and mosques. I explored the urban settings for my novel and took in the nature around them. I tried to immerse myself as much as possible in the Indianness of my main character. After six months I had enough local colour and detail.<br><br>I returned to Canada and spent a year and a half doing research. I read the foundational texts of Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. I read books on zoo biology and animal psychology. I read castaway and shipwreck stories.<br><br>All the while, in India and in Canada, I took notes. On the page, in a smashed-up, kaleidoscopic way, <b>Life of Pi </b>began to take shape. I took a while to decide what animal would be my main animal protagonist. At first I had an elephant in mind. The Indian elephant is smaller than the African, and I thought an adolescent male would fit nicely in the lifeboat. But the image of an elephant in a lifeboat struck me as more comical than I wanted. I changed to a rhinoceros. But rhinos are herbivores and I could not see how I could keep a herbivore alive in the high seas. And a constant diet of algae struck me as monotonous for both reader and writer, if not for the rhino. I finally settled upon the choice that in retrospect seems the obvious one: a tiger.<br><br>For the algae island, I chose meerkats because I wanted a small ferret-like creature without the connotations that ferrets have. I wanted a neutral animal upon which I could paint a personality of my choice. Also, <i>meerkat </i>rhymes somewhat with <i>mirage</i> and <i>meekness</i>, which makes no particular sense, but there you go, whoever said writers always know what they&#8217;re doing.<br><br>The blind, cannibal Frenchman in the other boat came to me in those first moments of inspiration in Matheran; in other words, I don't know where he came from. In my first draft, the scene with the Frenchman was much longer, close to 45 pages. It was one of my favourite sections. It was Beckett in the Pacific, I thought. Which was precisely the problem, my editor told me. It was funny and absurd, she told me, but in the wrong place, like a good joke told at a funeral. The tone was wrong; it broke with what came before and after. So I had to cut it down substantially.<br><br>The rest was fun hard work, a daily getting it down on the page that came not without hurdles, not without moments of doubt, not without mistakes and rewrites, but always, always with deep, gratifying pleasure, with a knowledge that no matter how the novel would fare, I would be happy with it, that it helped me understand my world a bit better.<br><br><b>3) What is it that you're exploring in this book?</b><br><br>The nature of belief. The role of imagination in understanding life. The role stories can play in our lives. The nature of religion. The workings of zoos. Humanity&#8217;s relationship to animals.<br><br><b>4) Who is your favourite character in this book, and why?</b><br><br>Richard Parker. He&#8217;s colourful.<b><br><br>5) Are there any tips you would give a book club to better navigate their discussion of your book?<br><br></b>Dream and speculate away.<br><br><b>6) Do you have a favourite story to tell about being interviewed about your book?</b><br><br>Interviews have merged into one big blur.<br><br><b>7) What question are you never asked in interviews but wish you were?<br><br></b>Would you like a thick, creamy hot chocolate made with real chocolate, Mr. Martel?<br><br><b>8) Has a review or profile ever changed your perspective on your work?<br><br></b>A book is 50%. The other half of it is what the reader brings. So every review brings something, some perspective, some point, some observation, that is new to me. I&#8217;m glad for that.<br><br><b>9) Which authors have been most influential to your own writing?<br><br></b>The usual suspects, the Great Dead White Males of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: Hardy, Conrad, Kafka, Hemingway, Hamsun, etc.<br><br><b>10) If you weren't writing, what would you want to be doing for a living? What are some of your other passions in life?</b><br><br>Let&#8217;s see&#8230; If I weren&#8217;t me, I&#8217;d like to be the Pope&#8217;s cat. Or an astronaut.

I have remained a faithful Hindu, Christian and Muslim. I decided to stay in Toronto. After one year of high school, I attended the University of Toronto and took a double-major Bachelor's degree. My majors were religious studies and zoology. My fourth-year thesis for religious studies concerned certain aspects of the cosmogony theory of Isaac Luria, the great sixteenth-century Kabbalist from Safed. My zoology thesis was a functional analysis of the thyroid gland of the three-toed sloth. I chose the sloth because its demeanour-calm, quiet and introspective-did something to soothe my shattered self. <p> There are two-toed sloths and there are three-toed sloths, the case being determined by the forepaws of the animals, since all sloths have three claws on their hind paws. I had the great luck one summer of studying the three-toed sloth in situ in the equatorial jungles of Brazil. It is a highly intriguing creature. Its only real habit is indolence. It sleeps or rests on average twenty hours a day. Our team tested the sleep habits of five wild three-toed sloths by placing on their heads, in the early evening after they had fallen asleep, bright red plastic dishes filledwith water. We found them still in place late the next morning, the water of the dishes swarming with insects. The sloth is at its busiest at sunset, using the word busy here in a most relaxed sense. It moves along the bough of a tree in its characteristic upside-down position at the speed of roughly 400 metres an hour. On the ground, it crawls to its next tree at the rate of 250 metres an hour, when motivated, which is 440 times slower than a motivated cheetah. Unmotivated, it covers four to five metres in an hour. <p> The three-toed sloth is not well informed about the outside world. On a scale of 2 to 10, where 2 represents unusual dullness and 10 extreme acuity, Beebe (1926) gave the sloth's senses of taste, touch, sight and hearing a rating of 2, and its sense of smell a rating of 3. If you come upon a sleeping three-toed sloth in the wild, two or three nudges should suffice to awaken it; it will then look sleepily in every direction but yours. Why it should look about is uncertain since the sloth sees everything in a Magoo-like blur. As for hearing, the sloth is not so much deaf as uninterested in sound. Beebe reported that firing guns next to sleeping or feeding sloths elicited little reaction. And the sloth's slightly better sense of smell should not be overestimated. They are said to be able to sniff and avoid decayed branches, but Bullock (1968) reported that sloths fall to the ground clinging to decayed branches "often". <p> How does it survive, you might ask. <p> Precisely by being so slow. Sleepiness and slothfulness keep it out of harm's way, away from the notice of jaguars, ocelots, harpy eagles and anacondas. A sloth's hairs shelter an algae that is brown during the dry season and green during the wet season, so the animal blends in with the surrounding moss and foliage and looks like a nest of white ants or of squirrels, or like nothing at all but part of a tree. <p> The three-toed sloth lives a peaceful, vegetarian life in perfect harmony with its environment. "A good-natured smile is forever on its lips," reported Tirler (1966). I have seen that smile with my own eyes. I am not one given to projecting human traits and emotions onto animals, but many a time during that month in Brazil, looking up at sloths in repose, I felt I was in the presence of upside-down yogis deep in meditation or hermits deep in prayer, wise beings whose intense imaginative lives were beyond the reach of my scientific probing. <p> Sometimes I got my majors mixed up. A number of my fellow religious-studies students-muddled agnostics who didn't know which way was up, in the thrall of reason, that fool's gold for the bright-reminded me of the three-toed sloth; and the three-toed sloth, such a beautiful example of the miracle of life, reminded me of God. <p> I never had problems with my fellow scientists. Scientists are a friendly, atheistic, hard-working, beer-drinking lot whose minds are preoccupied with sex, chess and baseball when they are not preoccupied with science. <p> I was a very good student, if I may say so myself. I was tops at St. Michael's College four years in a row. I got every possible student award from the Department of Zoology. If I got none from the Department of Religious Studies, it is simply because there are no student awards in this department (the rewards of religious study are not in mortal hands, we all know that). I would have received the Governor General's Academic Medal, the University of Toronto's highest undergraduate award, of which no small number of illustrious Canadians have been recipients, were it not for a beef-eating pink boy with a neck like a tree trunk and a temperament of unbearable good cheer. <p> I still smart a little at the slight. When you've suffered a great deal in life, each additional pain is both unbearable and trifling. My life is like a memento mori painting from European art&#58; there is always a grinning skull at my side to remind me of the folly of human ambition. I mock this skull. I look at it and I say, "You've got the wrong fellow. You may not believe in life, but I don't believe in death. Move on!" The skull snickers and moves ever closer, but that doesn't surprise me. The reason death sticks so closely to life isn't biological necessity-it's envy. Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud. The pink boy also got the nod from the Rhodes Scholarship committee. I love him and I hope his time at Oxford was a rich experience. If Lakshmi, goddess of wealth, one day favours me bountifully, Oxford is fifth on the list of cities I would like to visit before I pass on, after Mecca, Varanasi, Jerusalem and Paris. <p> I have nothing to say of my working life, only that a tie is a noose, and inverted though it is, it will hang a man nonetheless if he's not careful. <p> I love Canada. I miss the heat of India, the food, the house lizards on the walls, the musicals on the silver screen, the cows wandering the streets, the crows cawing, even the talk of cricket matches, but I love Canada. It is a great country much too cold for good sense, inhabited by compassionate, intelligent people with bad hairdos. Anyway, I have nothing to go home to in Pondicherry. <p> Richard Parker has stayed with me. I've never forgotten him. Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart. I still cannot understand how he could abandon me so unceremoniously, without any sort of goodbye, without looking back even once. That pain is like an axe that chops at my heart. <p> The doctors and nurses at the hospital in Mexico were incredibly kind to me. And the patients, too. Victims of cancer or car accidents, once they heard my story, they hobbled and wheeled over to see me, they and their families, though none of them spoke English and I spoke no Spanish. They smiled at me, shook my hand, patted me on the head, left gifts of food and clothing on my bed. They moved me to uncontrollable fits of laughing and crying. <p> Within a couple of days I could stand, even make two, three steps, despite nausea, dizziness and general weakness. Blood tests revealed that I was anemic, and that my level of sodium was very high and my potassium low. My body retained fluids and my legs swelled up tremendously. I looked as if I had been grafted with a pair of elephant legs. My urine was a deep, dark yellow going on to brown. After a week or so, I could walk just about normally and I could wear shoes if I didn't lace them up. My skin healed, though I still have scars on my shoulders and back. <p> The first time I turned a tap on, its noisy, wasteful, superabundant gush was such a shock that I became incoherent and my legs collapsed beneath me and I fainted in the arms of a nurse. <p> The first time I went to an Indian restaurant in Canada I used my fingers. The waiter looked at me critically and said, "Fresh off the boat, are you?" I blanched. My fingers, which a second before had been taste buds savouring the food a little ahead of my mouth, became dirty under his gaze. They froze like criminals caught in the act. I didn't dare lick them. I wiped them guiltily on my napkin. He had no idea how deeply those words wounded me. They were like nails being driven into my flesh. I picked up the knife and fork. I had hardly ever used such instruments. My hands trembled. My sambar lost its taste. <p> <p> <BR><BR><i>Continues...</i> </i></b></blockquote> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Life of Pi</b> by <b>Yann Martel</b> Copyright &copy; 2003 by Yann Martel.
