But Odd finds himself in trouble&rsquo;s path once more, for a killer is stalking the ancient, holy halls and Odd is about to encounter an enemy who eclipses any he has yet encountered.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Rarely has a character been so instantly embraced by readers as Koontz's unlikely hero, Odd Thomas, the wise and gentle fry cook, who just happens to see dead people. It is just as rare for a narrator to so perfectly capture the essence of a character that it is hard to imagine anyone else giving him voice, but such is the case with Baker. In this third adventure, Odd has left his hometown and taken up residence in a monastery high in the Sierras. Surrounded by loving but eccentric brothers and sisters, Odd hopes to rest and recover from the horrific events of the last two books. But after he discovers the body of one of the monastery brothers, Odd finds himself going up against a supernatural force that threatens the lives of everyone who lives within the monastery walls. Baker beautifully interprets the first-person narration. Like Odd himself, Baker's delivery is mellow and low key, perfectly fitting Odd's calm, self-possessed point of view. Suspenseful, funny and heartbreakingly sweet, this is a fine, enjoyable production. <I>Simultaneous release with the Bantam hardcover (Reviews, Oct. 30).

											It wasn't the plot that kept me reading but the likable, funny and well developed characters of Brother Knuckles and the mysterious, witty and unpredictable Rodion Romanovich.<p/><p/>I really liked the fact that Koontz goes back to creating wonderful characters and dialog but sadly he didn't utilize Odd's ability to see the dead as much as I expected and enjoy.<p/><p/>However, Odd Thomas still gives me enough promise and excitement that I'm eager to start book #4 hoping it will head back into the direction of Odd Thomas #1.

His imagination is a veritable factory of nightmares, conjuring twisted tales of psychological complexity. He even has a fan in Stephen King. For decades, Dean Koontz's name has been synonymous with terror, and his novels never fail to quicken the pulse and set hearts pounding.<p>    Koontz has a lifelong love of writing that led him to spend much of his free time as an adult furiously cultivating his style and voice. However, it was only after his wife Gerda made him an offer he couldn't refuse while he was teaching English at a high school outside of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that he had a real opportunity to make a living with his avocation. Gerda agreed to support Dean for five years, during which time he could try to get his writing career off the ground. Little did she know that by the end of that five years she would be leaving her own job to handle the financial end of her husband's massively successful writing career.<p>    Koontz first burst into the literary world with 1970's <I>Beastchild</I>, a science fiction novel that appealed to genre fans with its descriptions of aliens and otherworldly wars but also mined deeper themes of friendship and the breakdown of communication. Although it is not usually ranked among his classics, <I>Beastchild</I> provided the first inkling of Koontz's talent for populating even the most fantastical tale with fully human characters. Even at his goriest or most terrifying, he always allows room for redemption. <p>    This complexity is what makes Koontz's work so popular with readers. He has a true gift for tempering horror with humanity, grotesqueries with lyricism. He also has a knack for genre-hopping, inventing Hitchcockian romantic mysteries, crime dramas, supernatural thrillers, science fiction, and psychological suspense with equal deftness and imagination. Perhaps <I>The Times</I> (London) puts it best: "Dean Koontz is not just a master of our darkest dreams, but also a literary juggler."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Shortly after graduating from college, Koontz took a job</b> with the Appalachian Poverty Program where he would tutor and counsel underprivileged kids. However, after finding out that the last person who held his job had been beaten up and hospitalized by some of these kids, Koontz was more motivated than ever to get his writing career going.<P>    <b>When Koontz was a senior in college, </b> he won the <I>Atlantic Monthly</I> fiction competition.  <P>  <b>Koontz and Kevin Anderson's novel <I>Frankenstein: The Prodigal Son </I></b>was slotted to become a television series produced by Martin Scorsese. However, when the pilot failed to sell, the USA Network aired it as a TV movie in 2004. By that time Koontz had removed his name from the project.  <p>  <I>Some fun and fascinating outtakes from our interview with Koontz:</I><p>    <b>"My wife, Gerda, and I took seven years of private ballroom dancing lessons</b>, twice a week, ninety minutes each time. After we had gotten good at everything from swing to the foxtrot, we not only stopped taking lessons, but also stopped going dancing. <I>Learning</I> had been great fun; but for both of us, going out for an evening of dancing proved far less exhilarating than the learning. We both have a low boredom threshold. Now we dance at a wedding or other celebration perhaps once a year, and we're creaky." <p>    <b>"On my desk is a photograph given to me by my mother after Gerda and I were engaged</b> to be married. It shows 23 children at a birthday party. It is neither my party nor Gerda's. I am three years old, going on four. Gerda is three. In that crowd of kids, we are sitting directly across a table from each other. I'm grinning, as if I already know she's my destiny, and Gerda has a serious expression, as if she's worried that I might be <I>her</I> destiny. We never met again until I was a senior in high school and she was a junior. We've been trying to make up for that lost time ever since. <p>    <b>"Gerda and I worked so much for the first two decades of our marriage</b> that we never took a real vacation until our twentieth wedding anniversary. Then we went on a cruise, booking a first-class suite, sparing no expense. For more than half the cruise, the ship was caught in a hurricane. The open decks were closed because waves would have washed passengers overboard. About 90% of the passengers spent day after day in their cabins, projectile vomiting. We discovered that neither of us gets seasick. We had the showrooms, the casino, and the buffets virtually to ourselves. Because the crew had no one to serve, <I>our</I> service was exemplary. The ship dared not try to put into the scheduled ports; it was safer on the open sea. The big windows of the main bar presented a spectacular view of massive waves and lightning strikes that stabbed the sea by the score. Very romantic. We had a grand time. <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2006, Dean Koontz took some time out to talk with us about his favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>  <b>What was the book that most influenced your career as a writer?</b><br>   The high-school grammar textbook with which my teacher, Winona Garbrick, repeatedly rapped my head.<p>    Otherwise, hundreds of books have had an effect on me. Perhaps the book with the most impact on my career, after the aforementioned textbook, was <I>A Tale of Two Cities</I> by Charles Dickens, which I did not read until I was in my thirties. The final scene reduced me to tears. More important, I began to think about how modern publishing had compartmentalized fiction into so many narrow genres. <I>A Tale of Two Cities</I>, as a new piece of fiction, would be hard to place on a contemporary publisher's list. It's too much of an adventure story and too much of a love story to win the favor of most editors of "literary" fiction. It is a serious novel of politics and revolution but is also darkly comic in places. Dickens does not shrink from the depiction of evil, and some scenes are horrific, but he also tells a story of redemption and self-sacrifice and hope that some (never me!) would consider almost sentimental. <p>    The more I thought about <I>A Tale of Two Cities</I>, the more determined I became to write novels that bridged genres. This began to bear fruit with <I>Strangers</I>, and to a much greater degree with <I>Watchers</I>. My publisher at the time resisted both the variety I was delivering, book to book, but also the mix of genres within each book. Pressure was exerted to stay within the limits of one label. We had some wonderful rows! In time, readers responded with enthusiasm to my attempts to tell stories with the flavors and the techniques of multiple genres. I doubt I would have had a career half as successful if I had followed another path. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  For three decades, I read no fewer than 200 books a year, and I still read a book a week. Out of that volume, choosing eight or ten as my favorites is no easy task, and a final list inevitably has an arbitrary quality dependent on my mood at the moment. In no meaningful order: <p>    <li>The complete novels of John D. MacDonald -- His work taught me more about how to create suspense, about how to create vivid characters, about creating a sense of place, and about the beauty of an economical prose style than have the novels of any other single writer. When I discovered John D., I read 34 of his books in 30 days, not just in his Travis McGee series, but in his stand-alones, which are even better. That was the most exhilarating extended experience I've ever had as a reader. <p>    <li><I>The Moviegoer</I> and <I>Love in the Ruins</I> by Walker Percy -- I am drawn to writers who believe in timeless virtues, who have a tragic sense of the human condition but remain hopeful, who have a pellucid style that is deceptively simple even as, in fact, it deals with First Things, the least simple of all themes. <p>    <li><I>The Postman Always Rings Twice</I> and <I>Double Indemnity</I> by James M. Cain -- I love noir fiction from the first half of the 20th century, and these are two of the finest examples of the genre. I don't find much contemporary noir that interests me, largely because it is bleak and hopeless, often anarchic and misanthropic. The great noir fiction was informed by a moral sense, so that the self-destructive actions of the leads, and even the indifference of fate, left you with a sense of meaning and a feeling that, in your own life, you have been damn lucky to squeak by without self-destructing. <p>    <li><I>The Abolition of Man</I> by C. S. Lewis -- Over sixty years old, this beautifully written little book has proved stunningly predictive. The society that Lewis foresaw, arising from the "intellectual" elite's contempt for such virtues as courage and honor and selflessness, is the crumbling civilization we now inhabit. I read it every year to remind myself that ideas matter and that bad ideas, surer than guns and bombs, can bring down a nation, a world. <p>    <li><I>The Dreaming Jewels</I> by Theodore Sturgeon -- This science-fiction novel has more stunning ideas packed into a couple of hundred pages than some authors' entire bodies of work, delivered in a limpid yet magical prose. Bravura storytelling. <p>    <li><I>A Canticle for Leibowitz</I> by Walter M. Miller -- A post-nuclear-holocaust novel that combines science fiction and mysticism in a compelling story told in sometimes hallucinatory prose. This is one of those rare novels that is genuinely sui generis, a unique reading experience. <p>    <li><I>The Complete Poems of T. S. Eliot</I> -- He demands much of the reader, but no other poetry so richly rewards close reading, repeated reading, and contemplation. His early work is darker than what he wrote later, but dark in a way that is half a step short of utter hopelessness. Of the later poems, "Four Quartets" contains arguably the most distilled language in English verse, relentlessly pushing us to confront the central truth of our existence. The lines are hard and clean, beautiful, evocative, insistent, haunting, and with redemptive power. <p>    <li><I>The Busy Body</I>, <I>The Fugitive Pigeon</I>, and <I>The Spy in the Ointment</I> are three of Donald E. Westlake's early books, among the funniest suspense novels ever written. I read these in my youth, and many years later they inspired me to mix humor with suspense in books like <I>Life Expectancy</I>. Westlake is versatile, continually switching throughout his career from hard-boiled suspense to comic suspense, to mainstream fiction as easily as another writer might change his shirts. <p>    <li><I>There Must be a Pony</I> by James Kirkwood -- A tragedy, a comedy, and arguable the funniest novel ever written from an adolescent point of view. The voice of the narrator rings so true that you can hear him long after you've turned the last page. Kirkwood deserved a lot more success as a novelist than he enjoyed. <p>    <li><I>Solider in the Rain</I>, <I>Temple of Gold</I>, <I>Control</I> and <I>The Color of Light</I> by William Goldman -- Goldman has had a strong career as a novelist, but his greatest success has been as a screenwriter. If he hadn't scored so big with movies like <I>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</I>, if his energies had gone entirely into novels, I think he would have been HUGE. He creates some of the most appealing characters in all of contemporary fiction, unafraid of sentiment and never stepping across the line into sentimentality. <p>    The four books I named are radically different from one another, yet you hear the wonderfully assured and ironic Goldman voice unmistakably on the first page of each. <I>The Color of Light</I> is one of the most dead-on portraits of a writer's struggle ever written, hugely entertaining; but if you learn nothing from it other than the mortal danger of taking the write-what-you-know dictum too seriously, it's worth a hundred times its price. <p>    I could go on for pages. So many writers have made my life so much richer than it otherwise would have been. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  Films do not move me in the same way that novels do because they lack the ability to explore the <I>interior</I> of a character in any depth. Consequently, I tend to find films of high intellectual intent to be empty shells, and the films that burn themselves into my memory are those that deliver sparkling wit or genuine emotion, or logically crafted suspense. I can watch <I>The Philadelphia Story</I>, <I>Bringing Up Baby</I>, and other screwball comedies every three or four years, and they are fresh to me because the writing crackles. Contemporary comedies seem incapable of the spot-on hilarious dialogue of so many films in the 1930s and '40s. <p>    Two of the most involving and logically tight suspense films I've ever seen are James Cameron's <I>The Terminator</I> and <I>Aliens</I>. And I'm a Hitchcock fan because of the way so many of his movies blended suspense, humor, and love stories. For their ability to convey intense emotion (and a wide variety of emotions) in the service of important themes, I like <I>Schindler's List</I>, <I>A Simple Plan</I>, and <I>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</I>. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I listen to everything from classical to pop, but I particularly favor Big Band, Texas swing, and Zydeco. I've written hundreds of thousands of words listening to Chris Isaac, Paul Simon, and especially Israel Kamakawiwo'ole; Iz, the dynamite Hawaiian singer who died several years ago, had a beautiful voice and the ability to convey longing, joy, and other emotions with an effortlessness that enraptured the listener. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I give books based on the interests and tastes of the recipients, so I give all kinds of things. What I most like to receive are illustrated books on any period of art or any kind of decorative objects -- by which I mean everything from a book on an artist like Childe Hassam to a full-color book on Art Deco radios or on beautiful engraved rifles. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have to wear a five-point hat with five small bells, each of a different metal from the others, and leather gloves with knuckle spikes. Nothing unique about that. All writers have the five-point hat and the spiked gloves. I like the lighting low, music low, stacks of research surrounding me for easy reference, a bottle of flavored water -- usually cherry -- close at hand, which I'll drink either cold or at room temperature. For at least part of the day, though she might be bored, I like the company of my dog; she is a furry muse. <p>      <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I sold the first short story I ever wrote. Then I collected 75 rejections before I sold anything else. I was a part-time writer for two years and a full-time writer for eleven years before I had a paperback bestseller. I wrote for another five years before one of my books appeared on the hardcover bestseller lists. By the time I'd had two hardcover bestsellers, a major national magazine made a snarky remark to the effect that I was an overnight success who had "jumped on the bloody bandwagon of the vampire-novel craze." Because more than 18 years of work seems to stretch the definition of "overnight" a tad too far, and because I'd never written a vampire novel, I figured everything else that I was reading in the magazine must be equally empty of fact, and I canceled my subscription. <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Most of the criticism you receive will be directed at your unique style. You will be pressured to modify your voice, to adopt the attitudes and prejudices of one herd or another. Thriller writers, science fiction writers, mystery writers, writers in every genre are expected to write like the successful models who have gone before them, with just enough exotic spice to intrigue without seeming dauntingly original. Even if you write experimental literary fiction, you will find that people who write and review experimental literary fiction have dogma that they want to enforce, and even out there on the imagined cutting edge, you will be shown the line that you must walk to be considered a serious writer. <p>    Resist. If you conform, you might be granted admittance to the club, you might be "discovered" and acclaimed, but you will not then be the writer you could have been. If you repress your true voice -- and therefore your passion -- long enough, you will burn out. Walker Percy gave the best advice <I>about</I> writing advice that I know: "The best thing to do with advice, even good advice, is to listen as hard as you can, take it to heart, then forget it." <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><i>Loop me in, odd one. </i>The words, spoken in the deep of night by a sleeping child, chill <br>the young man watching over her.

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Rarely has a character been so instantly embraced by readers as Koontz's unlikely hero, Odd Thomas, the wise and gentle fry cook, who just happens to see dead people. It is just as rare for a narrator to so perfectly capture the essence of a character that it is hard to imagine anyone else giving him voice, but such is the case with Baker. In this third adventure, Odd has left his hometown and taken up residence in a monastery high in the Sierras. Surrounded by loving but eccentric brothers and sisters, Odd hopes to rest and recover from the horrific events of the last two books. But after he discovers the body of one of the monastery brothers, Odd finds himself going up against a supernatural force that threatens the lives of everyone who lives within the monastery walls. Baker beautifully interprets the first-person narration. Like Odd himself, Baker's delivery is mellow and low key, perfectly fitting Odd's calm, self-possessed point of view. Suspenseful, funny and heartbreakingly sweet, this is a fine, enjoyable production. <I>Simultaneous release with the Bantam hardcover (Reviews, Oct. 30).

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>In this thrilling, rather poignant sequel to Koontz's Odd Thomas (2003), the young psychic seeker visits a California monastery poised for attack by shadowy foes. Koontz marvelously sets the scene in the tight, heart-stopping first chapter: One December night, Odd Thomas, a 21-year-old hard-luck kid from Pico Mundo, Calif., now a guest of several months at St. Bartholomew's Abbey in the Sierra Nevada, follows some ghosts on a mission to Room 32 of the monastery's school for handicapped children. Called "bodachs," after evil spirits in British folklore, these horrifying protean spirits prefigure some kind of disaster to the children-and Odd, using the paranormal gift shared exclusively by the dog, Boo, has only a day or two at most to try to find out what the danger is and how to block it. Odd, tragically, lost the love of his life, Stormy, 16 months before, when she perished in a fire, and yet she now seems to be speaking through one of the paralyzed children, indicating to him who among them might know more about the imminent threat. Indeed, evidence points to Jacob, a retarded artist at the school, who renders in his drawings startlingly realistic depictions of a ghoulish, bony creature at the window that he calls the Neverwas. Meanwhile, Odd interviews numerous folks at the monastery, including a former New Jersey hit man for the Mafia, a world-renowned physicist who turned increasingly self-tortured and the inimitable Mother Superior, as steely as General George Patton. Terrific characterization and patient plotting mark Koontz's work, and this novel about the triumph of modesty over hubris proves exemplary on both counts. A work both exciting and engaging-and with its heart in theright place.

The primeval forests that clothed the rising slopes were themselves cloaked in darkness.<br><br>From this third-floor window, I could see only part of the deep front yard and the blacktop lane that cleaved it. Four low lampposts with bell-shaped caps focused light in round pale pools.<br><br>The guesthouse is in the northwest wing of the abbey. The ground floor features parlors. Private rooms occupy the higher and the highest floors.<br><br>As I watched in anticipation of the storm,a whiteness that was not snow drifted across the yard, out of darkness, into lamplight.<br><br>The abbey has one dog, a 110-pound German-shepherd mix, perhaps part Labrador retriever. He is entirely white and moves with the grace of fog. His name is Boo.<br><br>My name is Odd Thomas. My dysfunctional parents claim a mistake was made on the birth certificate, that Todd was the wanted name. Yet they have never called me Todd.<br><br>In twenty-one years, I have not considered changing to Todd. The bizarre course of my life suggests that Odd is more suited to me, whether it was conferred by my parents with intention or by fate.<br><br>Below, Boo stopped in the middle of the pavement and gazed along the lane as it dwindled and descended into darkness.<br><br>Mountains are not entirely slopes. Sometimes the rising land takes a rest. The abbey stands on a high meadow, facing north.<br><br>Judging by his pricked ears and lifted head, Boo perceived a visitor approaching. He held his tail low.<br><br>I could not discern the state of his hackles, but his tense posture suggested that they were raised.<br><br>From dusk the driveway lamps burn until dawn ascends.

His head lowered. His ears flattened against his skull.<br><br>For a moment, I could not see the cause of Boo&#8217;s alarm. Then . . . into view came a shape as elusive as a night shadow floating across black water. The figure passed near enough to one of the lampposts to be briefly revealed.<br><br>Even in daylight, this was a visitor of whom only the dog and I could have been aware.<br><br>I see dead people, spirits of the departed who, each for his own reason, will not move on from this world. Some are drawn to me for justice, if they were murdered, or for comfort, or for companionship; others seek me out for motives that I cannot always understand.<br><br>This complicates my life. I am not asking for your sympathy. We all have our problems, and yours seem as important to you as mine seem to me.<br><br>Perhaps you have a ninety-minute commute every morning, on freeways clogged with traffic, your progress hampered by impatient and incompetent motorists, some of them angry specimens with middle fingers muscular from frequent use. Imagine, however, how much more stressful your morning might be if in the passenger seat was a young man with a ghastly ax wound in his head and if in the backseat an elderly woman, strangled by her husband, sat pop-eyed and purple-faced.<br><br>The dead don&#8217;t talk. I don&#8217;t know why. And an ax-chopped spirit will not bleed on your upholstery.<br><br>Nevertheless, an entourage of the recently dead is disconcerting and generally not conducive to an upbeat mood.<br><br>The visitor on the lawn was not an ordinary ghost, maybe not a ghost at all. In addition to the lingering spirits of the dead, I see one other kind of supernatural entity. I call them <i>bodachs</i>.<br><br>They are ink-black, fluid in shape, with no more substance than shadows. Soundless, as big as an average man, they frequently slink like cats, low to the ground.<br><br>The one on the abbey lawn moved upright&#58; black and featureless, yet suggestive of something half man, half wolf. Sleek, sinuous, and sinister.<br><br>The grass was not disturbed by its passage. Had it been crossing water, it would not have left a single ripple in its wake.<br><br>In the folklore of the British Isles, a bodach is a vile beast that slithers down chimneys at night and carries off children who misbehave. Rather like Inland Revenue agents.<br><br>What I see are neither bodachs nor tax collectors. They carry away neither misbehaving children nor adult miscreants. But I have seen them enter houses by chimneys&#8211;by keyholes, chinks in window frames, as protean as smoke&#8211;and I have no better name for them.<br><br>Their infrequent appearance is always reason for alarm. These creatures seem to be spiritual vampires with knowledge of the future. They are drawn to places where violence or fiery catastrophe is destined to erupt, as if they feed on human suffering.<br><br>Although he was a brave dog, with good reason to be brave, Boo shrank from the passing apparition. His black lips peeled back from his white fangs.<br><br>The phantom paused as if to taunt the dog. Bodachs seem to know that some animals can see them.<br><br>I don&#8217;t think they know that I can see them, too. If they did know, I believe that they would show me less mercy than mad mullahs show their victims when in a mood to behead and dismember.<br><br>At the sight of this one, my first impulse was to shrink from the window and seek communion with the dust bunnies under my bed. My second impulse was to pee.<br><br>Resisting both cowardice and the call of the bladder, I raced from my quarters into the hallway. The third floor of the guesthouse offers two small suites. The other currently had no occupant.<br><br>On the second floor, the glowering Russian was no doubt scowling in his sleep. The solid construction of the abbey would not translate my footfalls into his dreams.<br><br>The guesthouse has an enclosed spiral staircase, stone walls encircling granite steps. The treads alternate between black and white, making me think of harlequins and piano keys, and of a treacly old song by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder.<br><br>Although stone stairs are unforgiving and the black-and-white pattern can be disorienting, I plunged toward the ground floor, risking damage to the granite if I fell and struck it with my head.<br><br>Sixteen months ago, I lost what was most precious to me and found my world in ruins; nevertheless, I am not usually reckless. I have less to live for than I once did, but my life still has purpose, and I struggle to find meaning in the days.<br><br>Leaving the stairs in the condition that I found them, I hurried across the main parlor, where only a night lamp with a beaded shade relieved the gloom. I pushed through a heavy oak door with a stained-glass window, and saw my breath plume before me in the winter night.<br><br>The guesthouse cloister surrounds a courtyard with a reflecting pool and a white marble statue of St. Bartholomew. He is arguably the least known of the twelve apostles. Here depicted, a solemn St. Bartholomew stands with his right hand over his heart, left arm extended. In his upturned palm is what appears to be a pumpkin but might be a related variety of squash.<br><br>The symbolic meaning of the squash eludes me.<br><br>At this time of year, the pool was drained, and no scent of wet limestone rose from it, as in warmer days. I detected, instead, the faintest smell of ozone, as after lightning in a spring rain, and wondered about it, but kept moving.<br><br>I followed the colonnade to the door of the guesthouse receiving room, went inside, crossed that shadowy chamber, and returned to the December night through the front door of the abbey.<br><br>Our white shepherd mix, Boo, standing on the driveway, as I had last seen him from my third-floor window, turned his head to look at me as I descended the broad front steps. His stare was clear and blue, with none of the eerie eyeshine common to animals at night.<br><br>Without benefit of stars or moon, most of the expansive yard receded into murk. If a bodach lurked out there, I could not see it.<br><br>&#8220;Boo, where&#8217;s it gone?&#8221; I whispered.<br><br>He didn&#8217;t answer. My life is strange but not so strange that it includes talking canines.<br><br>With wary purpose, however, the dog moved off the driveway, onto the yard. He headed east, past the formidable abbey, which appears almost to have been carved from a single great mass of rock, so tight are the mortar joints between its stones.<br><br>No wind ruffled the night, and darkness hung with folded wings.<br><br>Seared brown by winter, the trampled grass crunched underfoot. Boo moved with far greater stealth than I could manage.<br><br>Feeling watched, I looked up at the windows, but I didn&#8217;t see anyone, no light other than the faint flicker of the candle in my quarters, no pale face peering through a dark pane.<br><br>I had rushed out of the guest wing wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt. December stropped its teeth on my bare arms.<br><br>We proceeded eastward alongside the church, which is part of the abbey, not a separate building.<br><br>A sanctuary lamp glows perpetually, but it isn&#8217;t sufficient to fire the colorful stained glass. Through window after window, that dim light seemed to watch us as though it were the single sullen eye of something in a bloody mood.<br><br>Having led me to the northeast corner of the building, Boo turned south, past the back of the church. We continued to the wing of the abbey that, on the first floor, contains the novitiate.<br><br>Not yet having taken their vows, the novices slept here. Of the five who were currently taking instruction, I liked and trusted four.<br><br>Suddenly Boo abandoned his cautious pace. He ran due east, away from the abbey, and I pursued him.<br><br>As the yard relented to the untamed meadow, grass lashed my knees. Soon the first heavy snow would compact these tall dry blades.<br><br>For a few hundred feet, the land sloped gently before leveling off, whereupon the knee-high grass became a mown lawn again. Before us in the gloom rose St. Bartholomew&#8217;s School.<br><br>In part the word school is a euphemism. These students are unwanted elsewhere, and the school is also their home, perhaps the only one that some of them will ever have.<br><br>This is the original abbey, internally remodeled but still an impressive pile of stone. The structure also houses the convent in which reside the nuns who teach the students and care for them.<br><br>Behind the former abbey, the forest bristled against the stormready sky, black boughs sheltering blind pathways that led far into the lonely dark.<br><br>Evidently tracking the bodach, the dog went up the broad steps to the front door of the school, and through.<br><br>Few doors in the abbey are ever locked. But for the protection of the students, the school is routinely secured.<br><br>Only the abbot, the mother superior, and I possess a universal key that allows admittance everywhere. No guest before me has been entrusted with such access.<br><br>I take no pride in their trust. It is a burden. In my pocket, the simple key sometimes feels like an iron fate drawn to a lodestone deep in the earth.<br><br>The key allows me quickly to seek Brother Constantine, the dead monk, when he manifests with a ringing of bells in one of the towers or with some other kind of cacophony elsewhere.<br><br>In Pico Mundo, the desert town in which I had lived for most of my time on earth, the spirits of many men and women linger. But here we have just Brother Constantine, who is no less disturbing than all of Pico Mundo&#8217;s dead combined, one ghost but one too many.<br><br>With a bodach on the prowl, Brother Constantine was the least of my worries.<br><br>Shivering, I used my key, and hinges squeaked, and I followed the dog into the school.<br><br>Two night-lights staved off total gloom in the reception lounge. Multiple arrangements of sofas and armchairs suggested a hotel lobby.<br><br>I hurried past the unmanned information desk and went through a swinging door into a corridor lighted by an emergency lamp and red EXIT signs.<br><br>On this ground floor were the classrooms, the rehabilitation clinic, the infirmary, the kitchen, and the communal dining room. Those sisters with a culinary gift were not yet preparing breakfast. Silence ruled these spaces, as it would for hours yet.<br><br>I climbed the south stairs and found Boo waiting for me on the second-floor landing. He remained in a solemn mood. His tail did not wag, and he did not grin in greeting.<br><br>Two long and two short hallways formed a rectangle, serving the student quarters. The residents roomed in pairs.<br><br>At the southeast and northwest junctions of the corridors were nurses&#8217; stations, both of which I could see when I came out of the stairs in the southwest corner of the building.<br><br>At the northwest station, a nun sat at the counter, reading. From this distance, I could not identify her.<br><br>Besides, her face was half concealed by a wimple. These are not modern nuns who dress like meter maids. These sisters wear old-style habits that can make them seem as formidable as warriors in armor.<br><br>The southeast station was deserted. The nun on duty must have been making her rounds or tending to one of her charges.<br><br>When Boo padded away to the right, heading southeast, I followed without calling to the reading nun. By the time that I had taken three steps, she was out of my line of sight.<br><br>Many of the sisters have nursing degrees, but they strive to make the second floor feel more like a cozy dormitory than like a hospital. With Christmas twenty days away, the halls were hung with garlands of fake evergreen boughs and festooned with genuine tinsel.<br><br>In respect of the sleeping students, the lights had been dimmed. The tinsel glimmered only here and there, and mostly darkled into tremulous shadows.<br><br>The doors of some student rooms were closed, others ajar. They featured not just numbers but also names.<br><br>Halfway between the stairwell and the nurses&#8217; station, Boo paused at Room 32, where the door was not fully closed. On block-lettered plaques were the names ANNAMARIE and JUSTINE.<br><br>This time I was close enough to Boo to see that indeed his hackles were raised.<br><br>The dog passed inside, but propriety made me hesitate. I ought to have asked a nun to accompany me into these students&#8217; quarters.<br><br>But I wanted to avoid having to explain bodachs to her. More important, I didn&#8217;t want to risk being overheard by one of those malevolent spirits as I was talking about them.<br><br>Officially, only one person at the abbey and one at the convent know about my gift&#8211;if in fact it is a gift rather than a curse. Sister Angela, the mother superior, shares my secret, as does Father Bernard, the abbot.<br><br>Courtesy had required that they fully understand the troubled young man whom they would be welcoming as a long-term guest.<br><br>To assure Sister Angela and Abbot Bernard that I was neither a fraud nor a fool,Wyatt Porter, the chief of police in Pico Mundo, my hometown, shared with them the details of some murder cases with which I had assisted him.<br><br>Likewise, Father Sean Llewellyn vouched for me. He is the Catholic priest in Pico Mundo.<br><br>Father Llewellyn is also the uncle of Stormy Llewellyn, whom I had loved and lost. Whom I will forever cherish.<br><br>During the seven months I had lived in this mountain retreat, I&#8217;d shared the truth of my life with one other, Brother Knuckles, a monk. His real name is Salvatore, but we call him Knuckles more often than not.<br><br>Brother Knuckles would not have hesitated on the threshold of Room 32. He is a monk of action. In an instant he would have decided that the threat posed by the bodach trumped propriety. He would have rushed through the door as boldly as did the dog, although with less grace and with a lot more noise.<br><br>I pushed the door open wider, and went inside.<br><br>In the two hospital beds lay Annamarie, closest to the door, and Justine. Both were asleep.<br><br>On the wall behind each girl hung a lamp controlled by a switch at the end of a cord looped around the bed rail. It could provide various intensities of light.<br><br>Annamarie, who was ten years old but small for her age, had set her lamp low, as a night-light. She feared the dark.<br><br>Her wheelchair stood beside the bed. From one of the hand grips at the back of the chair hung a quilted, insulated jacket. From the other hand grip hung a woolen cap. On winter nights, she insisted that these garments be close at hand.<br><br>The girl slept with the top sheet clenched in her frail hands, as if ready to throw off the bedclothes. Her face was taut with an expression of concerned anticipation, less than anxiety, more than mere disquiet.<br><br>Although she slept soundly, she appeared to be prepared to flee at the slightest provocation.<br><br>One day each week, of her own accord, with eyes closed tight, Annamarie practiced piloting her battery-powered wheelchair to each of two elevators. One lay in the east wing, the other in the west.<br><br>In spite of her limitations and her suffering, she was a happy child. These preparations for flight were out of character.<br><br>Although she would not talk about it, she seemed to sense that a night of terror was coming, a hostile darkness through which she would need to find her way. She might be prescient.<br><br>The bodach, first glimpsed from my high window, had come here, but not alone. Three of them, silent wolflike shadows, were gathered around the second bed, in which Justine slept.<br><br>A single bodach signals impending violence that may be either near and probable or remote and less certain. If they appear in twos and threes, the danger is more immediate.<br><br>In my experience, when they appear in packs, the pending danger has become imminent peril, and the deaths of many people are days or hours away. Although the sight of three of them chilled me, I was grateful that they didn&#8217;t number thirty.<br><br>Trembling with evident excitement, the bodachs bent over Justine while she slept, as if studying her intently. As if feeding on her.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>
