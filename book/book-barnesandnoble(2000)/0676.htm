Luckily for her legions of fans, Cook returns with another sparkling romantic comedy that's reminiscent of <i>Must Love Dogs</i> in all the right ways, but very much its own animal&#151;about a relationship-challenged single woman, her quirky-to-put-it-mildly extended family, and the summer the shark movie came to town.</P><P>Life's a bit of a beach these days for Ginger Walsh, who's single at forty-one and living back home in the family FROG (Finished Room Over Garage). She's hoping for a more fulfilling life as a sea glass artist, but instead is babysitting her sister's kids and sharing overnights with Noah, her sexy artist boyfriend with commitment issues and a dog Ginger's cat isn't too crazy about. Geri, her BlackBerry-obsessed sister, is also nearly over the deep end about her pending fiftieth birthday (and might just drag Ginger with her). Toss in a dumpster-picking father, a <i>Kama Sutra</i> T-shirt-wearing mother, a movie crew come to town with a very cute gaffer, an on-again-off-again glassblower boyfriend, plus a couple of Red Hat realtors, and hilarity ensues. The perfect summer read, <i>Life's a Beach</i> is a warm, witty, and wise look at what it takes to move forward at any stage in life.</P>
</p><h3>Fresh Fiction</h3><p>Humorous, light, and at times touching. Cook once again hits the mark.<p>

											I was really looking forward to reading this on my beach vacation, but I was disappointed. I wanted beach fluff, but this was not it.  I think the cover and title is very deceptive and does not foretell the book's plot.  I like fluff occassionally, but this was not even good fluff.  I will stick with Janet Evanovich when i want that(highly recommend her!).  The characters were irritating and didn't seem very real, especially the dad.  It really was just kind of boring.  I kept putting it down, forced myself to finish it.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Full-Bloom/Janet-Evanovich/e/9780312934309/?pv=y">Full Bloom (Janet Evanovich's Full Series #5)</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/One-for-the-Money/Janet-Evanovich/e/9780312990459/?pv=y">One for the Money (Stephanie Plum Series #1)</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Good, but not a &quot;go out and get it right now!&quot; book<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=lovebooks2CA">lovebooks2CA</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1368370_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780641939020_BK_1_1368370" href="#previewReview_1368370" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>April 26, 2010: 
											I picked this up in the clearance section because I was going to a beachy spot on a mini vacation. I managed to read it all and it was good. It happened to take place at the same place I was visting. (Cape Cod) It was light hearted, an easy read, and had a good ending. I would say this is a good book if you don't want to get caught up reading all day but want to read a couple of chapters at a time and set it down for a bit. I happened to read it in a couple of days.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/37140000/37142854.JPG" alt="" height="146" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Claire Cook</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Scituate, Massachusetts</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>February 14, 1955</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Alexandria, Virginia</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A., Film and Creative Writing, Syracuse University</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.clairecook.com">* Claire Cook's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Raised on Nancy Drew mysteries, Claire Cook has wanted to write ever since she was a little girl. She majored in theater and creative writing at Syracuse University and immersed herself in a number of artistic endeavors (copywriter, radio continuity director, garden designer, and dance and aerobics choreographer), yet somehow her dreams got pushed to the side for more real-life matters -- like marriage, motherhood, and a teaching career. Decades passed, then one day she found herself parked in her minivan at 5 AM, waiting for her daughter to finish swim practice. She was struck with a now-or-never impulse and began writing on the spot. By the end of the season, she had a first draft. Her first novel, <i>Ready to Fall</I>, was published in 2000, when Cook was 45.<p>    Since then, this "late starter" has more than made up for lost time. She struck gold with her second book, <i>Must Love Dogs</I>. Published in 2002, this story of a middle-aged divorcee whose singles ad produces hilariously unexpected results was declared "funny and pitch-perfect" by the <i>Chicago Tribune</I> and "a hoot" by the <i>Boston Globe</I>. (The novel got a second life in 2005 with the release of the feature film starring Diane Lane and John Cusack.) Cook's subsequent novels, with their wry, witty take on the lives of middle-aged women, have become bestsellers and book club favorites.<p>     Upbeat, gregarious, and grateful for her success, Cook is an inspiration for aspiring writers and women in midlife transition. She tours indefatigably for her novels and genuinely enjoys speaking with fans. She also conducts frequent writing workshops, where she dispenses advice and encouragement in equal measure. "I'm extraordinarily lucky to spend my time doing what I love," she has said on countless occasions. " The workshops are a way to say thank you and open doors that I stumbled through to make it easier for writers coming up behind me.''</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>In our interview, Cook shared some fun and fascinating anecdotes with us: </I> <p>    <b>"I first knew I was a writer when I was three.</b> My mother entered me in a contest to name the Fizzies whale, and I won in my age group. It's quite possible that mine was the only entry in my age group since "Cutie Fizz" was enough to win my family a six-month supply of Fizzies tablets (root beer was the best flavor) and half a dozen turquoise plastic mugs with removable handles. At six I had my first story on the "Little People's Page" in the Sunday paper (about Hot Dog, the family Dachshund) and at sixteen, I had my first front page feature in the local weekly."<p>    <b>"In the acknowledgments of <I>Multiple Choice</I> I say that</b> even though it's probably undignified to admit it, I'm having a blast as a novelist. To clarify that, having a blast as a novelist does not necessarily mean having a blast with the actual <I>writing</I>. The people part -- meeting readers and booksellers and librarians and the media -- is very social and I'm having lots of fun with that. The writing part is great, too, once you get past the procrastination, the self-doubt, and the feelings of utter despair. It's all of the stuff surrounding the writing that's hard; once you find your zone, your place of flow, or whatever it is we're currently calling it, and lose yourself in the writing, it really is quite wonderful. I've heard writers say it's better than sex, though I'm not sure I'd go <I>that</I> far."<p>    <b>"I love books that don't wrap everything up too neatly at the end</b>, and I think it's a big compliment to hear that a reader is left wanting more. After each novel, I hear from many readers asking for a sequel -- they say they just <I>have</I> to find out what will happen to these people next. I think it's wonderful that the characters have come to life for them. But, for now, I think I'll grow more as a writer by trying to create another group of quirky characters. Maybe a few books down the road, I'll feel ready to return to some of them -- who knows?" <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2004, Cook took some time out to answer some of our questions about her favorite books, authors, and interests.</I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>  I get asked this question a lot on book tour, and I'm always tempted to say anything by Jane Austen or Alice Munro, just so people will know I'm well read, and sometimes I'm even tempted to say something by Gogol, just so people will think I'm really, really well read. But, alas, ultimately I tell the truth. The Nancy Drew books influenced me the most. I think they taught me a lot about pacing, and about ending chapters in such a way that the reader just can't put the book down and absolutely has to read on to the next chapter. I also think these books are responsible for the fact that I can't, for the life of me, write a chapter that's much longer than ten pages.  <p>    There's another variation of this question that I'm asked all the time on book tour: Who are your favorite authors? I always answer it the same way: My favorite authors are the ones who've been nice to me. It's so important for established authors to take emerging authors under their wings. Two who've been particularly generous to me as mentors and friends are Mameve Medwed and Jeanne Ray. Fortunately, they both happen to be very talented -- and funny -- so if you've somehow missed their books, you should read them immediately. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you? </b><br>  You might be starting to notice that I have a tendency to tweak the questions a bit. I think of it as the what-a-great-question-but-here's-the-one-I'd-love-to-answer approach. Hope it's okay to change this to my ten favorite books by authors who've been nice to me: <p>    <li><I>Mail</I> by Mameve Medwed  <li><I>Host Family</I> by Mameve Medwed  <li><I>The End of an Error</I> by Mameve Medwed  <li><I>Julie and Romeo</I> by Jeanne Ray  <li><I>Step-Ball-Change</i> by Jeanne Ray  <li><I>Eat Cake</I> by Jeanne Ray  <li><I>Truth and Beauty</I> by Ann Patchett  <li><I>Little Children</i> by Tom Perrotta  <li><I>Lucy Crocker 2.0</I> by Caroline Preston  <li><I>The Mystery at Lilac Inn</I> by Carolyn Keene (couldn't resist getting a Nancy Drew book in!)  <p>      <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing? </b><br>  I love all kinds of music, but I rarely listen to music while I'm writing. I get too pulled into the lyrics, and that distracts me from the words I should be writing. My son has a great collection of chant music (think Benedictine monks), and sometimes I'll put on one of those CD's, or some classical music, really low, so I can just barely hear it. But mostly I wait until I'm finished writing and music is my reward for pages rendered. <p>    When I'm not writing, I listen to Eva Cassidy a lot. I find her voice, her choice of music and the story of her tragic death just as her career was taking off all very moving. I've listened to Bonnie Raitt for so long she feels like an old friend. Susan Tedeschi is from the same area as me and I love her great bluesy sound, and in my teaching days, I taught several of the Aerosmith kids, so their dads' music has a special place in my heart, too. <p>        <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts? </b><br>  I love to give books about writing. Carolyn See's <I>Making a Literary Life: Advice for Writers and Other Dreamers</I> is a particular favorite, as is Annie Lamott's <I>Bird by Bird</i>. <p>    I'm a judge for the 2004 Thurber Prize for American Humor, so I've been reading some very, very funny books lately. I've actually started making a list of the ones I want to give as gifts to family and friends. Sorry, the judging is secret, so I can't give the titles away yet.... <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing? </b><br>  I wrote my first novel in my minivan outside my daughter's swim practice at 5 in the morning. After that, I can write anywhere and under any conditions -- it's just such a thrill to be out of the car! I do give myself a daily page quota when I'm working on a novel. I even record the page numbers on a calendar so I don't cheat. I've found that every day of my life presents me with dozens of perfectly valid reasons not to write. My kids, my house, my hair. And occasionally even more glamorous things like interviews and movie deals. So, for me, the only way to actually write a novel is to get really disciplined with myself. I write two pages a day, every day, or I'm not allowed to go to sleep. It gets ugly sometimes, but it works. <p>      <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes? </b><br>  My first novel was published at age 45 after decades of being afraid to take the risk of writing a novel. Looking back, I think I fully expected that the day after graduating from college, a novel would emerge, fully formed, like giving birth. When that didn't happen, I felt like an imposter. I did lots of other creative, interesting things, and brought up two great kids along the way, but my unrealized dream to write a novel was always in the background, quietly eating away at me. Being a novelist is the thing I almost missed. But, all's well that ends well, and I'm thrilled I finally got up the nerve to do it. So many women have written to say that my story has been an inspiration to them, and I hope that's true. <p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be -- and why?</b><br>  I'm not sure most writers want to be "discovered." The goal, it seems to me, is to have your books discovered by individual readers who will spread the word to their family and friends, who will spread the word to their family and friends.... And then, because your books have done well, your publisher will want your next book, and you'll get to write it! I think most writers want their books to be famous while they hide out at home, writing away in their pajamas! <p>    But, once again, I haven't answered your question, so let me try. I'd have to say that I've heard from so many emerging writers that I don't think I could pick just one. I wish them all the talent, luck and tenacity they'll need to get their books discovered! <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I think it's really important to mentor other writers once you've been lucky enough to have some success yourself. Not too long ago, however, it dawned on me that if I had coffee with every emerging writer who asked, I'd never get my own writing done. So, I offered to do a free writing workshop at my local library, and 125 people showed up! (Maybe it was the free part...) We had a great time, and a couple of patterns emerged. <p>    One, I think many writers don't spend enough time researching the world they're trying to break into. Books like <I>Writers' Market</I> are invaluable tools to help you figure out how to approach an agent or an editor, how to write a query letter, how to format your manuscript, etc. Two, you have to stay open to constructive criticism and be willing to hang in there draft after draft until your manuscript is as good as you can get it <I>before</i> you send it out. Then, once it finds a home, you'll do it all over again! I'm amazed how many people think you just whip out a draft and --presto! -- it's a book. Which leads to my third point: I've noticed is that a lot of emerging writers jump from project to project at the first sign of boredom or rejection, or because they've come up with an even better idea. Lots of writers can start a book -- but you'll never get it published unless you FINISH it!  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><b>By the bestselling author of <i>Must Love Dogs</i>, the story of two grown-up sisters who fight like cats and dogs&#151;but call each other at least twice a day</b></P><P>When <i>Must Love Dogs</i> was published, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> called it "pitch-perfect" and the <i>Washington Post</i> declared, "Readers will hope that Claire Cook will be telling breezy summer stories from the South Shore of Massachusetts for seasons to come." Luckily for her legions of fans, Cook returns with another sparkling romantic comedy that's reminiscent of <i>Must Love Dogs</i> in all the right ways, but very much its own animal&#151;about a relationship-challenged single woman, her quirky-to-put-it-mildly extended family, and the summer the shark movie came to town.</P><P>Life's a bit of a beach these days for Ginger Walsh, who's single at forty-one and living back home in the family FROG (Finished Room Over Garage). She's hoping for a more fulfilling life as a sea glass artist, but instead is babysitting her sister's kids and sharing overnights with Noah, her sexy artist boyfriend with commitment issues and a dog Ginger's cat isn't too crazy about. Geri, her BlackBerry-obsessed sister, is also nearly over the deep end about her pending fiftieth birthday (and might just drag Ginger with her). Toss in a dumpster-picking father, a <i>Kama Sutra</i> T-shirt-wearing mother, a movie crew come to town with a very cute gaffer, an on-again-off-again glassblower boyfriend, plus a couple of Red Hat realtors, and hilarity ensues.

</p><h3>Edgartown Books</h3><p>I picked up a bound copy of Claire Cook�s <i>Life�s a Beach</i> at NEIBA and wanted to be the first to recommend it for a Booksense pick for June 2007. The timing of the release and the subject matter will make this book a beach "must read". I really found myself escaping to the Cape. I feel like I became part of the family dynamics and fell in love with precocious Riley. The characters (both the wonderful and the exasperating) are fabulous and I hated for the book to end. Get out the lemonade and beach chair and enjoy!</p><h3>Armchair Bookstore</h3><p>Just finished Claire Cook's latest novel scheduled for publication in summer 2007 by Hyperion.  Once again, Claire has created a quirky, warm, witty pair of sisters who don't always agree but are always there for each other.  Add in two bickering parents, three rambunctious children, and a cat named Boyfriend and the scene is set for a rollicking good time.  A Hollywood film crew, fake shark and all, will make this Cape Cod  tale a guaranteed hot summertime read.

Ginger Walsh has always been envious of those possessing passion and conviction. Over the years she's blindly wandered from job to job and man to man. Now 41, Ginger is back in her hometown falling into a spinster-like existence. She freeloads off her parents and earns spare cash babysitting the kids of her annoyingly composed sister, Geri. Geri and Ginger have never gotten along, with Geri always taking the straight and narrow path and Ginger opting for the road less traveled. Now Geri's 50th birthday is looming, and she feels trapped by her roles of executive, wife and mother. As for Ginger, she wonders if her restless ways have kept her from experiencing the joys of family and a fulfilling career. When a movie crew lands in their small New England town, the sisters are given a chance to shake things up. Ginger takes Geri's kids to the movie's casting call, and though Ginger doesn't get discovered, one of Geri's kids is picked for a speaking part in the movie. Since Geri is obsessed with her career, she pawns the caretaker role off on Ginger. Ginger leaps at the chance to be a de facto stage mom. Accompanying her nephew on location will help her avoid analyzing her latest flagging romance and perhaps spark some creative energy. Soon the sisters will need each other to confront disappointment and heartbreak. While their rivalry provides a few giggles, the overall effect feels forced. Cook (Multiple Choice, 2004, etc.) ably catalogues the issues facing 40-something women, but the generic settings and tepid romances prevent this book from taking off. Agent: Lisa Bankoff/ICM
</p><h3>What People Are Saying</h3><p><strong>Adriana Trigiani</strong><br>"Claire Cook has an original voice, sparkling style and a window into family life that will make you laugh and cry.

I'm giving it to my sister today!"--(Adriana Trigiani, author of HOME TO BIG STONE GAP)
</p><br><p><strong>Mary Kay Andrews</strong><br>"LIFE'S A BEACH is a delicious coming of age novel-about two forty-something sisters who don't quite manage that feat until it's almost too late.

She's spent a few too many years in  sales, and is hoping for a more fulfilling life as a sea glass artist, but instead is  babysitting her sister's kids and sharing overnights with Noah, her sexy  glassblower boyfriend with commitment issues and a dog Ginger's cat isn't too  crazy about.  <p>     <b>You can almost smell the salt air</b> as you take this rollicking ride with one  slightly relationship-challenged single woman, one older BlackBerry obsessed  married-with-children sister on the verge of turning fifty, one dump picking  father, one kama sutra t-shirt wearing mother, one movie crew come to town  with a very cute gaffer, plus a couple of Red Hat Realtors and a pair of evil twins.  <b>Reminiscent of her bestseller <i>Must Love Dogs</i></b> in all the right ways, yet very  much its own animal, Claire Cook's new novel <b>sparkles with warmth, wit, and  wisdom</b>, as you'll see in the following passages....  <p>     I was squeaky clean and my hair had been conditioned for at least two of the  suggested three minutes when the water went cold. I did a quick rinse, then turned the  faucet off. The plastic shower curtain moved a few inches, and a clean white towel  magically appeared. Noah had already left when I woke up, but maybe he'd only made a  breakfast run. Or maybe he just couldn't stay away. I smiled.  <p>     "Here you go," my mother said from the other side of the curtain.  <p>     I screamed. I wrapped myself in the towel and stepped out of my tiny square  shower and practically into my mother. "Jesus, Mom, I thought you were ... someone  else."  <p>     "Noah? He left at six-twenty-five this morning. And tell him to watch that pebble  business or he'll break a window." My mother started dabbing my shoulders with another  towel.  <p>     "Mom, stop."  <p>     My mother kept dabbing. There were no limits in our family. I could clearly  remember sitting in the bathtub with a book one night when I was ten or eleven. My  sister, Geri, had already gone off to college, and my parents had company for dinner.  Suddenly, the door opened and four adults looked in at me and my bubbles. "Say good  night to Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien," my mother said.  <p>     Today, my mother was wearing her <i>Girls Just Wanna Have Fun</i> T-shirt, and a  couple of tiny beaded braids in her thick grey hair made her look like she'd just come  back from the Caribbean. I was kind of wishing she were there now. "Listen," she said,  "your father and I have found the townhouse of our dreams. The Village of Silver  Springs. Fitness Center with personal trainers, billiards, bingo, indoor boccie ball, salsa  lessons. You know how your father loves to dance."  <p>     "It's not just a townhouse, it's a lifestyle," a strange voice said.  <p>     I peeked behind my mother to see two women wearing red hats. They were  measuring what I liked to think of as my carriage house with a bright yellow tape  measure. My cat watched silently from the rumpled sheets of my still-pulled-out sleeper  sofa.  <p>     On my best days, I could convince myself that, with me at the far end of my  parents' driveway, and my sister and her family about a mile away, we had our own little  Kennedy compound. On my worst days, I had to admit that I lived in an apartment over  my parents' garage.  <p>     The women waved. I hiked my towel up a little higher. "Mom," I whispered, "get  them out of here. Now."  <p>     My mother reached down and scratched my cat under his chin. She said, "Hi,  handsome," and he purred his acknowledgment. She nudged yesterday's bra, which had  somehow ended up in the middle of the floor, with her toe. "You're going to have to start  keeping things a little bit neater around here, honey."  <p>     One of the women, the one wearing a jeweled red visor, didn't seem to be the  least bit bothered by the fact that I was dripping all over the apartment she was trying to  help my mother sell right out from under me. In fact, she acted like I wasn't even there.  "A FROG is a nice bonus feature," she said. "Everybody loves a FROG."  <p>     "Excuse me," I said, not that it was any of her business. "But, actually, it's not a  Finished Room Over the Garage. It has a bath and a kitchen, which makes it technically  more of a carriage house."  <p>     Everybody ignored me. "If you bury a statue of St. Joseph in the ground," the  visor woman said, "the house will get scooped up right away. Guaranteed."  <p>     "Mom," I said with every bit of outrage I could muster without dropping my  towel. I wondered if telling these women this wasn't a legal rental unit would make them  lose interest, or if it would only get me in trouble with my mother.  <p>     "You have to be careful how you bury it," the other woman said. Her hat had a  frothy drape of red netting that covered her eyes, so maybe I really was invisible to her.  "My cousin said she faced hers away from the house when she buried it, and the house  across the street sold instead."  <p>     "Upside down and facing the house is the way to go," the other woman said. "If  he's upside down, that way St. Joseph will work extra hard to get out of the ground and  onto the mantel of your new townhouse."  <p>     My mother was actually nodding, as if these two trespassing red-hatted women  were not completely and certifiably insane. "Well," I said loudly, "I don't want to keep  you. Sounds like you'd better get over to the mall fast before they run out of statues."  <p>     Now they were all nodding, so I started inching my mother toward the door,  hoping the other two would follow. They did, though the first woman had unfortunately  mastered the art of walking and talking at the same time. "But," she said, "for St. Joseph  to be fully effective, you also have to do all the necessary fix ups, price the house to  reflect the current market, and of course, properly stage the home. Cut flowers, cookies  baking in the oven, some pine scent potpourri. <i>Then</i> you add the statue."  <p>     We were almost there. My mother leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek,  and I reached past her to open the door. "Sorry I have to run," she said.  <p>     "Not a problem," I said as I hiked my towel up again.  <p>     "We'll catch up later, honey."  <p>     "You bet we will," I said.  <p>     When I slammed the door behind them, I just missed the backside of one red-hatted   Realtor.  <p>  <p>     I didn't really think Noah would be in there with another woman, but you didn't  get to be my age without a few jolting experiences in your life, and it never hurt to be  sure.  <p> Noah was alone. His glassblowing furnace was open and blazing. He must have  just turned on his CD player, because a scratchy recording of Gregorian chants blasted  out at full volume and made me jump. He was wearing jeans with huge, frayed white rips  in them and an old T-shirt.  <p>     He leaned back against the wall, and then kind of slid down until he was sitting  cross-legged on the floor. I was half waiting for him to start chanting along with the  Gregorians. Or even to start wrapping duct tape around PVC pipe so he could have a  swordfight with some elves or something.  <p>     He sat there for a little while, then stood up again and tied a washed-out red  bandana around his head, tangling some of his hair in when he knotted it in the back. He  reached for his sunglasses and put them on, and I waited to see something along the lines  of one of his open studio demonstrations. Instead, he started to dance. It took me  completely by surprise, and I stepped away from the window and pulled [my cat] with  me.  <p>     I peeked in again, from the side. It wasn't quite a dance after all. More like tai chi  or some kind of yoga in motion. Whatever he was doing, it was filled with long, graceful,  continuous movements, and I could have sworn there was a little bit of imaginary  swordplay in there, too.  <p>     He picked up a long blowpipe with a big knob of sea green glass on the end and  clamped it across his work bench. Then he grabbed another smaller rod and dipped it into  the furnace, and when he pulled it out he rolled the button-shaped gather of hot glass  around in an old tin filled with crushed cobalt glass. He kept the first pipe spinning with  his knee at the same time he twirled molten glass from the second pipe around the  original blob of glass. Then he picked up some metal tongs and reached into the glass and  twisted and pulled at it until it froze into a series of waves.  <p>     He stopped and put everything down, stepped back, and looked at the knob from  all sides, gave it a spin, then he did some more almost dancing around the room.  <p>     He came back and unclamped the blowpipe and plunged the knob into the  furnace. He placed it back in the clamp again and kept it spinning with one hand. With  the other, he reached into another tin and pulled out a handful of something that might  have been pieces of gold and silver foil and sprinkled them like confetti over the knob.  <p>     He put the blowpipe back into the furnace again, and sweat soaked through his T-shirt.   He pulled it back out and dropped the glass end down until it almost touched the  ground. The monks were still chanting, and Noah looked like he was lip-synching into  the other end of the pipe. Maybe he was. Then he started to swing the pipe in a huge  circle, crossing his wrists, as if he were twirling a fiery baton.  <p>     Finally, he lifted the pipe and placed his creation into the empty center of a sphere  made from several lengths of copper tubing circled around and around and dangling from  a clamp. He blew some air into the blowpipe and quickly covered the opening with his  thumb. The blob of glass expanded slowly and magically until it filled up the copper orb  and became some new kind of ringed planet.  <p>     Watching Noah like this was somehow more intimate than having sex with him. I  felt like a stalker. In fact, I probably looked like a stalker.  <p>                                       * * *  <p>     "Come on, let's find something good to do for your birthday."  <p>     Geri leaned over the balcony so she could catch the light from the parking lot.  "<i>One of Last Call's intoxicatingly handsome employees will deliver himself to your place  of inebriation by way of motorcycle. Once there, the custom Italian cycle folds up and  stows neatly in your trunk, and said handsome employee drives you home again in your  car.</i> God, that sounds so sexy."  <p>     "It sounds okay," I said. "But we'd have to get drunk first. And then we'd  probably puke all over the handsome employee. And, most likely, they don't have a Last  Call franchise on the Cape anyway."  <p>     "We could start one," my sister said.  <p>     "Yeah, but then we'd have to go all the way to Italy for the motorcycles."  <p>     "And the handsome employees."  <p>     "And what would we feed them? Where would they sleep?"  <p>     Geri sighed. "You're right. It's a lot of work."  <p>     "It always is." I pushed myself out of the chair and tiptoed into the hotel room. I  opened the minibar and took out two minibottles.  <p>     I tiptoed back out and handed one to Geri. "Here you go. We'll just stay right here  and pretend."  <p>     "Is Baileys Irish Cream from Italy?" she asked.  <p>     "I'm pretty sure," I said.  <p>     "Where's my glass?"  <p>     "Don't you know anything? You have to drink from the bottle or it's not an  authentic minibar experience. Plus, I don't want to sound like Mom, but we have no idea  who's been drinking from those glasses."  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'> Excerpted from <b>LIFE'S A BEACH</b> by <b>Claire Cook</b>  Copyright &copy 2007   by Claire Cook.
