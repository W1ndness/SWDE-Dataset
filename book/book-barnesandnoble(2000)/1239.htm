											I've really enjoyed this series that author Debbie Macomber has written. The characters are warm and engaging and the reader cannot help but to wonder what will happen next in Cedar Cove. Although this is classified as a romance novel, there's a bit of a mystery as well.<p/><p/>The mystery begins when Dan Sherman, Grace's husband, leaves his family. Later his body is found next to a suicide note. In the note, Dan informs Grace about an incident that happened during Vietnam. This incident has haunted him his entire life. Later we learn a stranger is found dead at Thyme and Tide Bed and Breakfast. Is his death somehow related to Dan?<p/><p/>Each book in this series, flows elegantly into the next one. Though the families live separate lives, the series has a small town appeal and everyone knows (and cares) for each other. If you are in search of a good series with likable characters, I'd suggest you start with book one 16 Lighthouse Road. Soon you too will get caught up in the happenings of Cedar Cove, WA.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/16-Lighthouse-Road/Debbie-Macomber/e/9781551668307/?pv=y">16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove Series #1)</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/204-Rosewood-Lane/Debbie-Macomber/e/9781551669298/?pv=y">204 Rosewood Lane (Cedar Cove Series #2)</a>. </p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/40470000/40476583.JPG" alt="" height="154" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Debbie Macomber</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Port Orchard, Washington</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>October 22, 1948</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Yakima, Washington</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Graduated from high school in 1966; attended community college</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.debbiemacomber.com">* Debbie Macomber's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Publishing did not come easy to self-described "creative speller" Debbie Macomber. When Macomber decided to follow her dreams of becoming a bestselling novelist, she had a lot of obstacles in her path. For starters, Macomber is dyslexic. On top of this, she had only a high school degree, four young children at home, and absolutely no connections in the publishing world. If there's one thing you can say about Debbie Macomber, however, it is that she does not give up. She rented a typewriter and started writing, determined to break into the world of romance fiction.   <P>The years went on and the rejection letters piled up. Her family was living on a shoestring budget, and Debbie was beginning to think that her dreams of being a novelist might never be fulfilled. She began writing for magazines to earn some extra money, and she eventually saved up enough to attend a romance writer's conference with three hundred other aspiring novelists. The organizers of the conference picked ten manuscripts to review in a group critique session. Debbie was thrilled to learn that her manuscript would be one of the novels discussed.   <P>Her excitement quickly faded when an editor from Harlequin tore her manuscript to pieces in front of the crowded room, evoking peals of laughter from the assembled writers. Afterwards, Macomber approached the editor and asked her what she could do to improve her novel. "Throw it away," the editor suggested.   <P>Many writers would have given up right then and there, but not Macomber. The deeply religious Macomber took a lesson from Job and gathered strength from adversity. She returned home and mailed one last manuscript to Silhouette, a publisher of romance novels. "It cost $10 to mail it off," Macomber told the <I>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</I> in 2000. "My husband was out of work at this time, in Alaska, trying to find a job. The children and I were living on his $250-a-week unemployment, and I can't tell you what $10 was to us at that time."   <P>It turned out to be the best $10 Macomber ever spent. In 1984, Silhouette published her novel, <I>Heartsong</I>. (Incidentally, although <I>Heartsong</I>  was Macomber's first sale, she actually published another book, <I>Starlight</I>, before <I>Heartsong</I> went to print.) <I>Heartsong</I> went on to become the first romance novel to ever be reviewed in <I>Publishers Weekly</I>, and Macomber was finally on her way.  <P>Today, Macomber is one of the most widely read authors in America. A regular on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller charts,  she is best known for her Cedar Cove novels, a heartwarming story sequence set in a small town in Washington state, and for her Knitting Books series, featuring a group of women who patronize a Seattle yarn store. In addition, her backlist of early romances, including several contemporary Westerns, has been reissued with great success.  <P>Macomber has made a successful transition from conventional romance to the somewhat more flexible genre known as "women's fiction." "I was at a point in my life where I found it difficult to identify with a 25-year-old heroine," Macomber said in an interview with ContemporaryRomanceWriters.com. "I found that I wanted to write more about the friendships women share with each other." To judge from her avid, ever-increasing fan base, Debbie's readers heartily approve.</P></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some outtakes from our interview with Macomber:</I> <p>  <b>"I'm dyslexic, although they didn't have a word for it</b> when I was in grade school. The teachers said I had 'word blindness.' I've always been a creative speller and never achieved good grades in school. I graduated from high school but didn't have the opportunity to attend college, so I did what young women my age did at the time -- I married. I was a teenager, and Wayne and I (now married nearly 37 years) had four children in five years."<p>    <b>"I'm a yarnaholic. That means I have more yarn stashed away</b> than any one person could possibly use in three or four lifetimes. There's something inspiring about yarn that makes me feel I could never have enough. Often I'll go into my yarn room (yes, room!) and just hold skeins of yarn and dream about projects. It's a comforting thing to do."<p>    <b>"My office walls are covered with autographs of famous writers</b> -- it's what my children call my �dead author wall.' I have signatures from Mark Twain, Earnest Hemingway, Jack London, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Pearl Buck, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, to name a few."  <p>     <b>"I'm morning person, and rip into the day with a half-mile swim</b> (FYI: a half mile is a whole lot farther in the water than it is on land) at the local pool before I head into the office, arriving before eight. It takes me until nine or ten to read through all of the guest book entries from my web site and the mail before I go upstairs to the turret where I do my writing. Yes, I write in a turret -- is that romantic, or what? I started blogging last September and really enjoy sharing bits and pieces of my life with my readers. Once I'm home for the day, I cook dinner, trying out new recipes. Along with cooking, I also enjoy eating, especially when the meal is accompanied by a glass of good wine. Wayne and I take particular pleasure in sampling eastern Washington State wines (since we were both born and raised in that part of the state). <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the spring of 2005, Debbie Macomber took some time out to answer our questions.</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  The one book that has had the strongest influence on my life, without question, is the Bible. God's Word has been the guiding force behind all I do. I read the Bible each and every day and gain inspiration, encouragement, and joy.  <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  Before I answer this, I feel it's necessary to mention that I read widely, across the board.  In compiling this list I discovered several of my favorite books are nonfiction. I have not noted the Bible a second time, although as I indicated above, it is the most influential book in my life. <p>    <li><I>Charms for the Easy Life</I> by Kaye Gibbons -- For its charm, its wonderful writing, and its truth. (I introduced this book to my editor, who now loves Kaye Gibbons's work as much as I do.) <p>    <li><I>And Then There Was Light</I> by Jacques Lusseyran -- I read this book shortly after learning that my father had been a POW in WWII, something he never talked about until the end of his life. It helped me understand some of what he endured and gave me a deep appreciation of the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation. <p>    <li><I>The Power of Positive Thinking</I> by Norman Vincent Peale -- When I first decided to write, I knew I was going to need all the positive reinforcement I could get. I read and reread Dr. Peale's wonderful words of wisdom. After I published my first book, I wrote Dr. Peale to thank him for his inspiration, and he wrote me back. It is a letter I will always treasure. <p>    <li><I>The Wolf and the Dove</I> by Kathleen E.  Woodiwiss -- I loved and read this historical romance so often that I had the first page nearly memorized. Kathleen Woodiwiss opened my eyes to the possibilities of fiction. These characters felt real to me. I cheered and cried with them and never wanted the book to end. I first read this book in the early 1980s and knew from that moment on that I wanted my readers to feel the same way when they finished one of my books.   <p>    <li><I>Why Good Girls Don't Get Ahead but Gutsy Girls Do</I> by Kate White -- This business-related book taught me that I'm a gutsy girl in a good-girl disguise. It offers some of the soundest career advice I've read. <p>    <li><I>The 21 Immutable Laws of Marketing</I> by Al Ries and Jack Trout -- Another wonderful business book that is  full of interesting tidbits about the buying public, their buying habits and how best to market to them. <p>    <li><I>The Notorious Rake</I> by Mary Balogh -- I'm a real fan of Regency romances, and I consider this one of the best.  I read this book in one sitting, unable to put it down. <p>    <li><I>The 13th Juror</I> by John Lescroart -- This is one of the best-plotted and most interesting books I've read in ages, and I have recommended it again and again. John is a wonderful writer, and we discovered that we have a great deal in common, including the fact that both our fathers were POWs in WWII. <p>    <li><I>If Ever I Return, Pretty Peggy-O</I> by Sharyn McCrumb -- My editor recommended this author to me and commented that she envied me the experience of reading my first Sharyn McCrumb. (This book is the first of her Ballad series, all set in Appalachia.) Later I was fortunate enough to meet Sharyn at a writers' conference, so I could tell her how much I enjoyed her work. <p>    <li><I>Walking After Midnight</I> by Karen Robards -- This book was pure fun. I felt as though I was on a roller-coaster ride, and every page was a thrill.  <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  I'm a big film buff, although I'm not fond of movies with excessive violence. I've always enjoyed musicals. My first exposure was with <I>West Side Story</I>. I memorized all the songs and belted them out for months afterward. I almost entered the convent after watching <I>The Sound of Music</I>. Thankfully, I didn't; it wouldn't have been a good fit for either of us. In recent years I've enjoyed <I>The Princess Bride</I> and the <I>Star Wars</I> series. I like movies with what I call a zinger -- <I>Collateral</I> and <i>The Replacement Killers</I> are good examples. And comedies, too.  I don't think I've ever laughed so hard as when I watched <I>The Gods Must Be Crazy</I>, <I>It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World</I>, and <I>The Hallelujah Trail</I>. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I don't listen to music while writing. It's not that I need silence in order to create. I started out writing when our four children were small and I needed to keep my ears tuned to them in case one of them decided to play Superman and fly out a window or start a campfire in the middle of the living room. When it comes to listening to the radio, I prefer the oldies stations. When I'm on the treadmill, I play Christian CDs and make a joyful noise. Correction: It's a joyful noise to me, but I doubt others would think so.  <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  There's a bookstore directly below my office. It's hard to believe but I write above a bookstore <I>and</I> an ice cream parlor. This, my friends, is a writer's nirvana. On average I buy a book a day, and that's no exaggeration. Mostly I purchase nonfiction for gifts. One of my favorites is <I>Gifts from the Sea</I> by Anne Morrow Lindberg. For my writer friends I've bought <I>Goals</I> by Brian Tracy, and for friends who are animal lovers I've bought <I>The Dog Who Rescues Cats</I> by Gonzalez & Fleischer. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have a cherrywood desk with a glass top to protect the wood. Over the years a number of things have made their way under the glass. There's a picture of my dad and his brother, who looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for identical twins -- only my dad was a full foot shorter than his brother. Then there are pictures of my grandchildren (by far the cutest grandkids in the universe), and there's a slip of paper on which I've written four words. They are:  "provocative," "relevant," "creative," and "honest." When I decide on a plot for one of my big hardcover stories, I weigh the story against each of these words. I want to provoke my readers to think. I want the story to be relevant to them and to our times. My goal is to tell this story in as creative a way as possible and to be honest with my readers and with myself. As you might have guessed, I'm a lover of words. As for rituals, I really don't have any.  <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  In my humble opinion, there are a lot of writers out there who haven't suffered enough. I suffered plenty. When I first started writing, I didn't know another writer in the world. This was back in the late 1970s before Romance Writers of America was formed. For nearly five years I wrote and submitted my manuscripts. My work was rejected so fast it practically hit me in the back of the head on my way home from the post office. At one point in my lonely sojourn, an editor read and reviewed my manuscript, and with the utmost sincerity told me there was no use in revising it and the best thing I could do was <I>throw it away</I>. Thankfully, I didn't take her advice, because that <I>same</I> manuscript sold to a rival publishing house and launched my writing career. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I would suggest that writers pay close attention to the market -- read the bestsellers, analyze each story and look for the key element that is drawing an audience. Who would ever have imagined that <I>Life of Pi</I> by Yann Martel would command the audience it has? Or <I>The Da Vinci Code</I>? As writers, it's important we not <I>follow</I> trends but observe and understand life -- and start our own. It was when I saw a lot of angel figurines turning up in catalogs that I wrote the first Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy Christmas book.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><p><b>Rosie Cox<br>311 Pelican Court<br>Cedar Cove, Washington<br></b></p> <p>Dear Reader,</p> <p>One ting about Cedar Cove &#151; people sure are interested in what other people are doing.

Who <i>wouldn't</i> feel that way? After seventeen years of what she'd believed to be a reasonably good <br>marriage, Zach's infidelity was the last thing she'd expected. <p>He'd never openly admitted to the affair. She hadn't found her husband in a compromising situation, hadn't found any <br>concrete evidence - no matchbooks from expensive restaurants, no jewelry receipts or motel bills - but in her heart <br>she knew. A wife always does. <p>Rosie owned up to the truth - she was angry and she'd expressed that anger by making this divorce as complicated and <br>difficult as she possibly could. Why should she go easy on Zach or walk away from their marriage without one hell of a <br>fight? And fight she had, with both fists raised. <p>As she turned away from the judge, the final decree in her hand, she realized she'd made another mistake. <p>Rosie had <i>assumed</i> that once the divorce was granted, the anger and bitterness of these dreadful months would be <br>lifted. Wrong again. An even heavier burden had been added. When the joint custody agreement she and Zach had so <br>carefully worked out, point by point, was presented to Judge Olivia Lockhart, the judge had rejected it. <p>Instead, Judge Lockhart had stated that it was emotionally detrimental to kids to shuffle them between residences every <br>few days. Allison and Eddie needed stable lives, according to Judge Lockhart, and <i>they</i> hadn't asked for the <br>divorce. Some people considered the judge innovative, Rosie thought, disgruntled. How about interfering? Or out of her <br>mind? Because - of all the crazy settlements - she'd awarded the children their house. That meant Rosie and Zach <br>would be the ones moving in and out. <p>Talk about ridiculous! Talk about impossible. <p>Now that the divorce was final, Rosie and Zach would have to figure out some kind of living arrangements. The <br>ramifications of what they'd agreed to were starting to hit Rosie and she hadn't even left the courtroom. <p>"Rosie," Sharon Castor, her attorney, said as soon as they were in the silent hallway outside the courtroom. "We have <br>to meet with your ex-husband." <p>One look told Rosie that Sharon was as flustered as she was herself. <p>Otto Benson, Zach's lawyer, joined them. Although he remained outwardly calm, his face was tense. She dared not glance <br>in Zach's direction. In fact, she'd avoided looking at her ex-husband from the moment she'd walked into the courtroom. <p>"Let's get a conference room and discuss the details," Zach's attorney said. <p>Rosie peered at Zach, standing behind his lawyer. He didn't seem any happier than she was with this decision, but she'd <br>keel over in a dead faint before she let him know how she felt. <p>"Rosie and I should be able to work this out ourselves," Zach said with an edge of irritation. <p>Given the way everything had gone so far, that suggestion wasn't promising. "If you remember, it took us weeks of <br>haggling to come up with this joint custody agreement," she pointed out. She enjoyed reminding him what a jerk he'd <br>been. Rosie supposed Zach was hoping to avoid more attorneys' fees. Too bad. If he ended up with less money to spend on <br>his girlfriend, that wasn't her concern. <p>Fists clenched, Zach snarled something under his breath. Probably just as well she couldn't hear it, Rosie decided, <br>proud of her own display of self-control. <p>"What makes you think we're capable of agreeing to anything without a mediator?" she asked sarcastically. <p>"Fine," Zach muttered, with a pout reminiscent of their nine-year-old son. Staring at him now, Rosie had trouble <br>believing she'd ever loved Zachary Cox. Not only was he smug and argumentative and self-righteous, he had no idea what <br>it meant to be a husband and father. Granted, Zach was a handsome man; not only that, his appearance proclaimed his <br>success as a businessman, a professional. Although, in her opinion, anyone with half a brain would instantly peg him <br>for an accountant. He had that narrowed look about his dark eyes, as if he spent too many hours a day squinting at <br>columns of tiny numbers. Despite that, he was appealing to the eye with his broad shoulders - which nicely set off his <br>expensive suit - and thick, dark hair. At one time he'd been an athlete, and even now he routinely jogged and kept in <br>shape. <p>Rosie had loved the firmness of his muscles as she stroked his back during lovemaking. Of course, it'd been months <br>since they'd slept in the same bed, and much longer since they'd actually made love. <p>Rosie didn't even remember the last time. Had she known, she might have appreciated it more, lingered a moment longer <br>at her husband's side, savored the feel of his arms around her. One thing was certain: Zach hadn't been interested in <br>her from the day he'd hired Janice Lamond as his personal assistant. <p>The thought of him entwined with Janice nearly suffocated Rosie and she forcefully shoved the image from her mind. <br>Anger and revulsion at her husband's - no, ex-husband's - unfaithfulness rose like bile in the back of her throat. <p>Zach's raised voice caught her attention; apparently he'd agreed to have their attorneys negotiate this added <br>complication to their divorce decree. Otto was checking with the clerk for an empty conference room. <p>Once a private room in the law library was secured, Zach and his attorney sat at one side of the table, across from <br>Rosie and hers. <p>Even the attorneys seemed perplexed by the situation. "I can't say I've ever heard of such a decree before," Sharon <br>said, starting the conversation. <p>"Me, neither." Otto frowned. "This is one for the books." <p>"Fine," Zach said in a curt voice, "it's unusual, but we're both adults. We can figure this out. I know <i>I</i> was <br>sincere about putting the children first." He glared at Rosie, as if to suggest she hadn't been. <p>"If you were sincere, you would've had second thoughts about sleeping with that slut." Rosie hadn't intended to be <br>argumentative, but if her ex-husband was so concerned about their children's welfare, he would never have broken his <br>wedding vows. <p>"I refuse to dignify that remark by responding to it," Zach said through gritted teeth. "Besides if you were home more, <br>instead of volunteering for every cause known to mankind, every cause <i>except</i> your children, you'd - " <p>"Well, I refuse to allow you to blame me for what <i>you've</i> done." Her volunteer efforts were Zach's big <br>complaint. He had his wish; she'd had to resign from every position she held and seek paid employment. She hoped he was <br>happy. For the first time since their children were born, Rosie wasn't a stay-at-home mom. <p>"I thought we were here to discuss this divorce decree?" Zach asked with a bored look, an expression that was obviously <br>for her benefit. "If we're going to trade insults I'd rather not pay our attorneys to listen." <p><i>(Continues...)</i> <p> <br><blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> <br>Excerpted from <b>311 Pelican Court</b> <br>by <b>Debbie Macomber</b> <br>Copyright &copy; 2003 by Harlequin Enterprises, Ltd. <br> Excerpted by permission.<br> All rights reserved.
