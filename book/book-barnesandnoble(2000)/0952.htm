So who would murder them-and why? Could their deaths have something to do with Plum Island, supposedly an animal research facility but possibly a top-secret site for biological warfare experiments? Could it involve a pirate's treasure buried in the vicinity more than 300 years ago? Returning to the Long Island, N.Y., setting of <i>The Gold Coast</i> (1990), DeMille makes his finest showing since that enormously popular book. Important to his success here is the catchy, ironic voice of narrator John Corey, a freewheeling Manhattan detective who's at his uncle's house on the Island to recover from bullet wounds and who gets tapped by the locals to act as "consultant" on the case. Key to the novel's sway is its boisterous plot, as DeMille expertly melds medical mystery, police procedural and nautical adventure, adding assorted love interests and capping matters with a ferocious storm at sea. Atmospherics are strong and the novel acquires its own storm force as it moves toward a cataclysmic denoument. DeMille's research seems sound as well, rendering the inner workings of a science lab as believable and fascinating as the discovery of treasure maps. It's a smooth job from an old pro who knows what readers are looking for.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>With his taut, suspenseful, and well researched thrillers, Nelson DeMille has become one of the most popular writers working today, publishing bestseller after bestseller.

											Finally went back to the beginning with John Corey and haven't been disappointed after reading books later in the Corey series.  I  find myself laughing out loud at some of Corey's comments and the positions he finds himself in. Regardless of the humor, these are well written dramas with true to life situations and relationships.  I would recommend readers follow up with the additional stories, as they only get better.  DeMille is a classic true crime writer with a lot of heart.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35705340.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Nelson DeMille</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>Jack Cannon; Kurt Ladner; Brad Matthews; Michael Weaver; Ellen Kay</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Long Island, New York</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>August 22, 1943</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>New York, New York</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A. in political science, Hofstra University, 1974</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Honorary doctorates from Hofstra University, Long Island University and Dowling College; Estabrook Award</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.nelsondemille.net/">* Nelson DeMille's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Nelson DeMille has a dozen bestselling novels to his name and over 30 million books in print worldwide, but his beginnings were not so illustrious. Writing police detective novels in the mid-1970s, DeMille created the pseudonym Jack Cannon: "I used the pen name because I knew I wanted to write better novels under my own name someday," DeMille told fans in a 2000 chat. <p>Between 1966 and 1969, Nelson DeMille served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. When he came home, he finished his undergraduate studies (in history and political science), then set out to become a novelist. "I wanted to write the great American war novel at the time," DeMille said in an interview with <I>January</I> magazine. "I never really wrote the book, but it got me into the writing process." A friend in the publishing industry suggested he write a series of police detective novels, which he did under a pen name for several years.     <p>Finally DeMille decided to give up his day job as an insurance fraud investigator and commit himself to writing full time -- and under his own name. The result was <I>By the Rivers of Babylon</I> (1978), a thriller about terrorism in the Middle East. It was chosen as a Book of the Month Club main selection and helped launch his career. "It was like being knighted," said DeMille, who now serves as a Book of the Month Club judge. "It was a huge break." </p>    <p>DeMille followed it with a stream of bestsellers, including the post-Vietnam courtroom drama <I>Word of Honor</I> (1985) and the Cold War spy-thriller <I>The Charm School</I> (1988) Critics praised DeMille for his sophisticated plotting, meticulous research and compulsively readable style. For many readers, what made DeMille stand out was his sardonic sense of humor, which would eventually produce the wisecracking ex-NYPD officer John Corey, hero of <I>Plum Island</I> (1997) and <I>The Lion's Game</I> (2000).     <p>In 1990 DeMille published <I>The Gold Coast</I>,  a Tom Wolfe-style comic satire that was his attempt to write "a book that would be taken seriously." The attempt succeeded, in terms of the critics' response: "In his way, Mr. DeMille is as keen a social satirist as Edith Wharton," wrote <I>The New York Times</I> book reviewer. But he returned to more familiar thrills-and-chills territory in <I>The General's Daughter</I>,  which hit no. 1 on <I>The New York Times'</I> Bestseller list and was made into a movie starring John Travolta. Its hero, army investigator Paul Brenner, returned in <I>Up Country</I> (2002), a book inspired in part by DeMille's journey to his old battlegrounds in Vietnam.     <p>DeMille's position in the literary hierarchy may be ambiguous, but his talent is first-rate; there's no questioning his mastery of his chosen form. As a reviewer for the <I>Denver Post</I> put it, "In the rarefied world of the intelligent thriller, authors just don't get any better than Nelson DeMille."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>DeMille composes</b> his books in longhand, using soft-lead pencils on legal pads. He says he does this because he can't type, but adds, "I like the process of pencil and paper as opposed to a machine. I think the writing is better when it's done in handwriting."    <p><b>In addition to his novels,</b> DeMille has written a play for children based on the classic fairy tale "Rumpelstiltskin."   <p>  <b>DeMille says</b> on his web site that he reads mostly dead authors -- "so if I like their books, I don't feel tempted or obligated to write to them." He mentions writing to a living author, Tom Wolfe, when The Bonfire of the Vanities came out; but Wolfe never responded. "I wouldn't expect Hemingway or Steinbeck to write back -- they're dead. But Tom Wolfe owes me a letter," DeMille writes.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>Nelson DeMille gave us some insight on his (surprisingly thriller-free) literary tastes and favorite pastimes.</i><p>    <b>What was the book that influenced your life the most, and why?</b><br>  <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> by Ayn Rand. I read this book in college, as many of my generation did, and I was surprised to discover that it said things about our world and our society that I thought only I had been thinking about, i.e., the ascendancy of mediocrity.  It was a relief to discover that there was an existing philosophy that spoke to my half-formed beliefs and observations.<p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books?</b><br>  I'll list only novels here: <ul><li><i>The Stranger</i> by Albert Camus  <li><i>Of Human Bondage</i> by W.

When two Long Island biologists are  found with  bullets in their skulls, NYPD Detective John Corey investigates. Little does he know that this puzzling local crime will soon fester into a crisis of cataclysmic proportions.</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Wounded in the line of duty, NYPD homicide detective John Corey is laid up in the Long Island town of Southold, home to farmers, fishermen &#151; and at least one killer.<br><br>Fast-paced and atmospheric, marked by entrancing characters, incandescent storytelling, and brilliant comic touches, <b>Plum Island</b> is DeMille at his thrill-inducing best.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Tom and Judy Gordon were bright, young, attractive scientists whom everyone seemed to like. So who would murder them-and why? Could their deaths have something to do with Plum Island, supposedly an animal research facility but possibly a top-secret site for biological warfare experiments? Could it involve a pirate's treasure buried in the vicinity more than 300 years ago? Returning to the Long Island, N.Y., setting of <i>The Gold Coast</i> (1990), DeMille makes his finest showing since that enormously popular book. Important to his success here is the catchy, ironic voice of narrator John Corey, a freewheeling Manhattan detective who's at his uncle's house on the Island to recover from bullet wounds and who gets tapped by the locals to act as "consultant" on the case. Key to the novel's sway is its boisterous plot, as DeMille expertly melds medical mystery, police procedural and nautical adventure, adding assorted love interests and capping matters with a ferocious storm at sea. Atmospherics are strong and the novel acquires its own storm force as it moves toward a cataclysmic denoument. DeMille's research seems sound as well, rendering the inner workings of a science lab as believable and fascinating as the discovery of treasure maps. It's a smooth job from an old pro who knows what readers are looking for.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>While investigating the murder of a young Long Island couple, an NYPD detective is stunned to find that they may have been involved in dealing genetically altered viruses.
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>While investigating the murder of a young Long Island couple, an NYPD detective is stunned to find that they may have been involved in dealing genetically altered viruses.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Since <i>The Charm School</i> (1988), DeMille's page-turning skills have only improved, peaking with <i>The Gold Coast</i> (1990), faltering on <i>Spencerville</i> (1994), and returning to form with this trip back to the Long Island venue of <i>The Gold Coast</i>.<P>This time, DeMille limns not the Fitzgeraldian wealth of Oyster Bay but rather the North Fork's comfortably well-off&#151;but less-fancy citizens. An NYPD homicide detective, John Corey, has moved into his uncle's fine digs overlooking Great Peconic Bay. Restlessly recuperating from wounds received in the line of duty, he's happy to answer the summons of the Chief of the Southold Town PD, an old friend, who hires him to consult on the double murder of Tom and Judy Gordon, biologists who worked on (nonfictional) Plum Island, the site of animal disease research for the Department of Agriculture. Were the Gordons murdered because they'd stolen some valuable new vaccine, or even a dreaded virus? They'd obviously far outspent their income, living high on the hog and buying a very expensive and speedy powerboat as well as an acre of bluff overlooking the bay. Had they been running drugs? Corey doesn't think so, although an ice chest missing from their boat points to something forbidden being hauled from Plum Island. He teams up with Beth Penrose, a Southold detective working her first homicide. Their visit to the Plum Island research facility and the Gordons' labs reveals only that the FBI and CIA have sanitized the place and have run up false information for public consumption. Corey also falls in with the star-crossed Emma Whitestone, a researcher of historic artifacts and an expert on Captain Kidd's lost treasure, which is thought to be buried somewhere nearby. Among the murder suspects is nasty viniculturalist Fredric Tobin, a smoothie who lures the ladies with champagne and Concorde jets.<P> Heavy wisecracking keeps the fun flowing as DeMille cranks up a thrilling, entertaining plot.<P>

I don't have a recipe, per se, but basically you make the polenta, which is cornmeal mush, according to the package directions, then you spread it out on a wood board and top it with tomato sauce, mozzarella, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, or whatever you like.  It's sort of like making your own pizza, except instead of pizza dough, you use cornmeal.  Then you put the board with everything in the oven for about ten minutes, remove with a spatula, serve, and watch the snow.<p>

There were two thirtyish couples aboard, having a merry old time, sunbathing, banging down brews and whatever. The women had on teensey-weensey little bottoms and no tops, and one of the guys was standing on the bow, and he slipped off his trunks and stood there a minute hanging hog, then jumped in the bay and swam around the boat. What a great country. I put down my binoculars and popped a Budweiser. <p> It was late summer, not meaning late August, but meaning September, before the autumnal equinox. Labor Day weekend had gone, and Indian summer was coming, whatever that is. <p> I, John Corey by name, convalescing cop by profession, was sitting on my uncle's back porch, deep in a wicker chair with shallow thoughts running through my mind. It occurred to me that the problem with doing nothing is not knowing when you're finished. <p> The porch is an old-fashioned wraparound, circling three sides of an 1890s Victorian farmhouse, all shingle and gingerbread, turrets, gables, the whole nine yards. From where I sat, I could see south across a sloping green lawn to the Great Peconic Bay. The sun was low on the western horizon, which was where it belonged at 6&#58;45 p.m. I'm a city boy, but I was really getting into the country stuff, the sky and all that, and I finally found the Big Dipper a few weeks ago. <p> I was wearing a plain white T-shirt and cutoff jeans that used to fit before I lost too much weight. My bare feet were propped on the rail, and between my left and right big toes was framed the aforementioned cabin cruiser. <p> About this time of day you can start to hear crickets, locusts, and who knows what, but I'm not a big fan of nature noises so I had a portable tape player beside me on the end table with The Big Chill cranking, and the Bud in my left hand, the binocs in my lap, and lying on the floor near my right hand was my off-duty piece, a Smith & Wesson .38 revolver with a two-inch barrel which fit nicely in my purse. Just kidding. <p> Somewhere in the two seconds of silence between "When a Man Loves a Woman" and "Dancing in the Street," I could hear or feel on the creaky old floorboards that someone was walking around the porch. Since I live alone and was expecting no one, I took the .38 in my right hand and rested it on my lap. So you don't think I'm a paranoid citizen, I should mention that I was convalescing, not from the mumps, but from three bullet wounds, two 9mm and one .44 caliber Magnum, not that the size of the holes matters. As with real estate, what matters with bullet holes is location, location, location. Obviously these holes were in the right locations because I was convalescing, not decomposing. I looked to my right where the porch turned around the west side of the house. A man appeared around the corner, then stopped about fifteen feet from me, searching the long shadows cast by the setting sun. In fact, the man cast a long shadow himself which passed over me, so he didn't seem to see me. But with the sun at his back, it was also difficult for me to see his face or to guess his intentions. I said, "Help you?" <p> He turned his head toward me. "Oh ... hey, John. Didn't see you there." <p> "Have a seat, Chief." I slipped my revolver into my waistband under my T-shirt, then lowered the volume on "Dancing in the Street." <p> Sylvester Maxwell, aka Max, who is the law in these here parts, sauntered toward me and plopped his butt on the rail, facing me. He was wearing a blue blazer, white button-down shirt, tan cotton slacks, boating shoes, and no socks. I couldn't tell if he was on or off duty. I said, "There're some soft drinks in that cooler." <p> "Thanks." He reached down and rescued a Budweiser from the ice. Max likes to call beer a soft drink. <p> He sipped awhile, contemplating a point in space about two feet from his nose. I directed my attention back toward the bay and listened to "Too Many Fish in the Sea"-The Marvelettes. It was Monday, so the weekenders were gone, thank God, and it was as I said after Labor Day when most of the summer rentals terminate, and you could feel the solitude returning again. Max is a local boy and he doesn't get right down to business, so you just wait it out. He finally asked me, "You own this place?" <p> "My uncle does. He wants me to buy it." <p> "Don't buy anything. My philosophy is, if it flies, floats, or fucks, rent it." <p> "Thank you." <p> "You going to be staying here awhile?" <p> "Until the wind stops whistling through my chest." <p> He smiled, but then got contemplative again. Max is a big man, about my age, which is to say mid-forties, wavy blond hair, ruddy skin, and blue eyes. Women seem to find him good-looking, which works for Chief Maxwell, who is single and hetero. <p> He said, "So, how're you feeling?" <p> "Not bad." <p> "Do you feel like some mental exercise?" <p> I didn't reply. I've known Max about ten years, but since I don't live around here, I only see him now and then. I should say at this point that I'm a New York City homicide detective, formerly working out of Manhattan North until I went down. That was on April twelfth. A homicide detective hadn't gone down in New York in about two decades so it made big news. The NYPD Public Information Office kept it going because it's contract time again, and with me being so personable, good-looking, and so forth, they milked it a little and the media cooperated, and round and round we go. Meanwhile, the two perps who plugged me are still out there. So, I spent a month in Columbia Presbyterian, then a few weeks in my Manhattan condo, then Uncle Harry suggested that his summer house was a fitting place for a hero. Why not? I arrived here in late May, right after Memorial Day. <p> Max said, "I think you knew Tom and Judy Gordon." <p> I looked at him. Our eyes met. I understood. I asked, "Both of them?" <p> He nodded. "Both." After a moment of respectful silence, he said, "I'd like you to take a look at the scene." <p> "Why?" <p> "Why not? As a favor to me. Before everyone else gets a piece of it. I'm short on homicide detectives." <p> In fact, the Southold Town Police Department has no homicide detectives, which usually works out okay because very few people get iced out here. When someone does, the Suffolk County police respond with a homicide detail to take over, and Max steps aside. Max does not like this. <p> A bit of locale here-this is the North Fork of Long Island, State of New York, the Township of Southold, founded, according to a plaque out on the highway, in sixteen-forty-something by some people from New Haven, Connecticut, who, for all anybody knows, were on the lam from the king. The South Fork of Long Island, which is on the other side of Peconic Bay, is the trendy Hamptons&#58; writers, artists, actors, publishing types, and other assorted anals. Here, on the North Fork, the folks are farmers, fishermen, and such. And perhaps one murderer. <p> Anyway, Uncle Harry's house is specifically located in the hamlet of Mattituck, which is about a hundred road miles from West 102nd Street where two Hispanic-looking gentlemen had pumped fourteen or fifteen shots at yours truly, accomplishing three hits on a moving target at twenty to thirty feet. Not an impressive showing, but I'm not criticizing or complaining. <p> Anyway, the Township of Southold comprises most of the North Fork, and contains eight hamlets and one village, named Greenport, and one police force of maybe forty sworn officers, and Sylvester Maxwell is the chief, so there it is. <p> Max said, "It doesn't hurt to look." <p> "Sure it does. What if I get subpoenaed to testify out here at some inconvenient time? I'm not getting paid for this." <p> "Actually, I called the town supervisor and got an okay to hire you, officially, as a consultant. A hundred bucks a day." <p> "Wow. Sounds like the kind of job I have to save up for." <p> Max allowed himself a smile. "Hey, it covers your gas and phone. You're not doing anything anyway." <p> "I'm trying to get the hole in my right lung to close." <p> "This won't be strenuous." <p> "How do you know?" <p> "It's your chance to be a good Southold citizen." <p> "I'm a New Yorker. I'm not supposed to be a good citizen." <p> "Hey, did you know the Gordons well? Were they friends?" <p> "Sort of." <p> "So? There's your motivation. Come on, John. Get up. Let's go. I'll owe you a favor. Fix a ticket." <p> In truth, I was bored, and the Gordons were good people.... I stood and put down my beer. "I'll take the job at a buck a week to make me official." <p> "Good. You won't regret it." <p> "Of course I will." I turned off "Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog" and asked Max, "Is there a lot of blood?" <p> "A little. Head wounds." <p> "You think I need my flip-flops?" <p> "Well ... some brains and skull blew out the back...." <p> "Okay." I slipped into my flip-flops, and Max and I walked around the porch to the circular driveway in the front of the house. I got into his unmarked PD, a white Jeep Cherokee with a squawky police radio. <p> We drove down the long driveway, which was covered with about a hundred years' worth of raw oyster and clam shells because Uncle Harry and everyone before him threw shells on the driveway along with the ash and cinders from the coal furnace to keep the mud and dust down. Anyway, this used to be what's called a bay farm estate, and it's still bayfront, but most of the farm acreage has been sold. The landscape is a little overgrown, and the flora is mostly the kind of stuff they don't use much anymore, such as forsythia, pussy willow, and privet hedges. The house itself is painted cream with green trim and a green roof. It's all pretty charming, really, and maybe I will buy it if the cop docs say I'm through. I should practice coughing up blood. <p> On the subject of my disability, I have a good shot at a three-quarter, tax-free pension for life. This is the NYPD equivalent of going to Atlantic City, tripping over a tear in the rug at Trump's Castle, and hitting your head on a slot machine in full view of a liability lawyer. Jackpot! <p> "Did you hear me?" <p> "What?" <p> "I said, they were found at 5&#58;45 p.m. by a neighbor-" <p> "Am I on retainer now?" <p> "Sure. They were both shot once in the head, and the neighbor found them lying on their patio deck-" <p> "Max, I'm going to see all this. Tell me about the neighbor." <p> "Right. His name is Edgar Murphy, an old gent. He heard the Gordons' boat come in about 5&#58;30, and about fifteen minutes later he walks over and finds them murdered. Never heard a shot." <p> "Hearing aid?" <p> "No. I asked him. His wife's got okay hearing, too, according to Edgar. So maybe it was a silencer. Maybe they're deafer than they think." <p> "But they heard the boat. Edgar is sure about the time?" <p> "Pretty sure. He called us at 5&#58;51 p.m., so that's close." <p> "Right." I looked at my watch. It was now 7&#58;10 p.m. Max must have had the bright idea to come collect me very soon after he got on the scene. I assumed the Suffolk County homicide guys were there by now. They would have come in from a little town called Yaphank where the county police are headquartered and which is about an hour drive to where the Gordons lived. <p> Max was going on about this and that, and I tried to get my mind into gear, but it had been about five months since I had to think about things like this. I was tempted to snap, "Just the facts, Max!" but I let him drone on. Also, "Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog" kept playing in my head, and it's really annoying, as you know, when you can't get a tune out of your head. Especially that one. I looked out the open side window. We were driving along the main east-west road, which is conveniently called Main Road, toward a place called Nassau Point where the Gordons live-or lived. The North Fork is sort of like Cape Cod, a windswept jut of land surrounded on three sides by water and covered with history. <p> The full-time population is a little thin, about twenty thousand folks, but there are a lot of summer and weekend types, and the new wineries have attracted day-trippers. Put up a winery and you get ten thousand wine-sipping yuppie slime from the nearest urban center. Never fails. <p> Anyway, we turned south onto Nassau Point, which is a two-mile-long, cleaver-shaped point of land that cuts into the Great Peconic Bay. From my dock to the Gordons' dock is about four miles. <p> Nassau Point has been a summer place since about the 1920s, and the homes range from simple bungalows to substantial establishments. Albert Einstein summered here, and it was from here in nineteen-thirty-whatever that he wrote his famous "Nassau Point Letter" to Roosevelt urging the president to get moving on the atomic bomb. The rest, as they say, is history. <p> Interestingly, Nassau Point is still home to a number of scientists; some work at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a secret nuclear something or other about thirty-five miles west of here, and some scientists work on Plum Island, a very top secret biological research site which is so scary it has to be housed on an island. Plum Island is about two miles off the tip of Orient Point, which is the last piece of land on the North Fork-next stop Europe. <p> Not incidental to all this, Tom and Judy Gordon were biologists who worked on Plum Island, and you can bet that both Sylvester Maxwell and John Corey were thinking about that. I asked Max, "Did you call the Feds?" <p> He shook his head. <p> "Why not?" <p> "Murder is not a federal offense." <p> "You know what I'm talking about, Max." <p> Chief Maxwell didn't respond. <p> <i>(Continues...)</i> <p> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Plum Island</b> by <b>Nelson DeMille</b> Copyright &copy; 1997 by Nelson Demille.
