											Not as bad as book 2 but nothing great either.  As it all pointed out, things have a 'happy ending', even mental illness is easily overcome.

											In the third book of the Annie's People series, The Brethren continues the story of Annie Zook and the people of the Amish community of Paradise. Annie has put away her paintings and is living with her friend Esther, who has been shunned for accepting Jesus and is worried about her husband Zeke who has accepted the responsibility of the death of his brother from long ago. Meanwhile Ben, the Englisher that stole Annie's heart, finds a secret about his past and goes back to Paradise to find answers. His discovery shakes up the entire community and brings new meaning to his and Annie's relationship.    i really liked this book yet I felt the book was a little rushed at the end. I want to know what will happen to Louisa and Sam in the future. Her story didn't move that much in this book. It was interesting to find out about Ben's past, yet it felt somewhat predictable once you found out he was adopted. I did finding out more about the culture and the customs of the people. It's very interesting that the Amish can live in modern America and still have a completely different society. I've enjoyed reading all of Beverly Lewis' Amish books and I had been waiting for the conclusion of this series. The Amish lifestyle has always fascinated me. They had been sadly brought into the limelight after the shooting a few months ago.    The thing that has always confused me about the Amish is what do they really believe in. After reading Lewis' books and especially this series, it seems that to have a personal relationship and admit that Jesus is your savior is considered vanity and grounds for being banned. They seem to only read from the Old Testament and even then only the bishops are allowed to really study it. Another series of Lewis' deals with a form of old medicine that can be considered as witchcraft. I understand most of their views about not conforming to the rest of the world and to keep life simple. What I don't understand is that it seems that the Amish are not really Christians if they don't believe in accepting Jesus into their lives.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>Annie Zook, the Amish preacher's daughter, is caught between two worlds.

								Violet Nesdoly</h3><p>Beverly Lewis continues to give her readers what they have found irresistible in her previous best-selling books.... If you've read the other two book in this series, The Preacher's Daughter and The Englisher, you'll not want to miss this conclusion to the story. If you haven't read any Beverly Lewis before, this book is certainly representative of her popular storytelling style...</p><h3>romancedesigns.com\

								Tracy Zappala</h3><p>In The Brethren, Beverly Lewis brings a compelling story of life in the Amish community. Lewis shows their religion and strong faith, as well as, their struggles with God and family. Readers will feel a part of the society and find characters and situations that will resonate with their own lives and experience. The Brethren draws readers into a complex world where tradition and faith are a way of life. Lewis brings to the forefront the roll of faith in everyday society and decisions that each character makes as they choose their path in life.</p><h3>Nancy Reed\

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>This is the third and final book in Lewis's "Annie's People" series, with all the story lines begun in the earlier works followed in this latest offering. Annie Zook promised her father that she wouldn't paint for six months and is waiting for her "sentence" to end. She feels he is unnecessarily harsher with her than with her brothers. When her best friend Essie's husband, Zeke Hochstetler, is arrested after confessing to the long-ago murder of his younger brother, Annie moves in with Essie to help with the four children and the work on the farm. This produces more problems for Annie as Essie is "under the shun" from their Amish community for attending the Mennonite Church. Meanwhile, Annie's father had forbidden her to see her sweetheart, Ben, so he goes home to Kentucky, where he discovers that he was adopted as a four-year-old. As usual, Lewis makes Annie and her people come alive. Unfortunately, it feels as if the author might have had another ending in mind, because the outcome seems contrived. Stina Nielsen reads in her customarily warm style, with the Amish voices having a different cadence from the English ones. Essential for libraries with the first two books in the series.</p><br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-custreview" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="loader" id="BK_9781616875220"><img alt="loading..." title="loading..." src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif"> Loading...</div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-fulldetails" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>Product Details</h3><div class="product-list-info"><div class="col-one"><ul><li class="pubDate">Pub.

An early  morning rain had dimpled the dirt on the shoulder  of Frogtown Road, populated now with pecking wrens  and robins. <p> At the reins in the Hochstetler buggy, Annie Zook  breathed in the tranquility, aware of plentiful  insects and thick green grass, fresh paint on  fences and a new martin birdhouse at Lapps' dairy  farm. Clicking her tongue to speed the pace, she  leaned forward in the seat, grateful for Zeke's  fast horse, as it was a good long walk between  Essie's house and <i>Daed</i>'s. <p> Only four days had come and gone since she had  impulsively packed up her belongings and gone to  Esther Hochstetler's, so Annie was surprised to  experience a sudden twinge as she made the turn  toward her father's house. <i>Am I homesick already?</i> <p> She wondered if Yonie, her nineteen-year-old  brother, would be at home when she arrived. <i>I miss  the rascal</i>, she thought. <p> Taking in the vibrant springtime colors, she  longed more than ever to immerse herself in art  once again. <i>I want to paint my beau</i>. But Ben was  no longer that, and their breakup was all her own  doing. Hers ... and Daed's. <p> <i>I never should've written that good-bye letter</i>,  she thought. Yet she had done so to obey her  father. <p> Her separation from Ben was cause for ongoing  sorrow.Thankfully, Esther wasn't one to ask  questions, even when tears sprang unexpectedly to  Annie's eyes. She had come awful close to blurting  out her beloved's name upon awakening one morning,  only to grit her teeth, forcing down the aching  lump in her throat. Speaking his name, even in the  private space of her room away from home, would  not have hurt a thing. But she never knew what  little ones might be roaming the hallway, and she  didn't trust herself to even breathe his name lest  she be overtaken with grief. Or was it pure  foolishness? <p> There had been plenty of times in the last few  days when she had tried to think of some way to  return to the lovely, secret world she and Ben had  so happily shared-till Daed had caught her riding  in Ben's car, wearing her hair down. Exactly which  of those transgressions was worse, according to  God and the brethren, she didn't know. She had  almost asked Cousin Julia for Ben's mailing  address on more than one occasion. And even more  shameless, she had been tempted to get on a bus,  show up at his doorstep, and beg his forgiveness. <p> <i>I'd be out of my mind to do such a thing....</i> <p> Yet she was beside herself at the thought of  living without him. <p> Annie saw a horse and buggy approaching, coming  fast. She strained to see who it might be out so  early. When she recognized Jesse Jr.'s wife-her  eldest sister-in-law-she wondered how Sarah Mae  might act toward her. Still, Annie was eager for  any contact with family. <p> Surprisingly, Sarah Mae offered a warm smile and a  wave. "Pull over and stop awhile!" she called out. <p> Annie was ever so pleased. She leaped from the  buggy and tied Zeke's horse to a tree trunk before  plump Sarah could even begin to get herself down  from her carriage. Annie ran like a girl who had  not seen hide nor hair of her kin in the longest  time. "Ach, Sarah Mae, 'tis such a nice surprise  to see you!" <p> "And you, too," Sarah Mae said, still holding the  reins. "I've been meaning to stop by." <p> "Over at Essie's, ya mean?" <p> Sarah Mae was slow to nod. "Well, maybe so ...  but-" <p> "I know it's terribly awkward," Annie interrupted,  "but do come sometime. I know Esther would enjoy  the company, just as I would." <p> Sarah Mae bowed her head for a moment, then raised  her pretty blue eyes. "Jesse Jr. could scarcely  believe it," she confided, telling how the People  had been talking up a storm about Annie's winning  the first place award for her covered bridge  painting. "Downright surprising, 'tis." <p> "Jah, I 'spect so." Annie didn't know quite how  she felt about this, folks discussing amongst  themselves her secret sin. Well, secret till now,  anyhow. <i>Sarah Mae must think I'm brazen ... and I  guess I was</i>. <p> Had Jesse and Sarah Mae seen her painting featured  on the cover of the <i>Farm and Home Journal</i> or  merely heard about it through the grapevine? She  didn't ask, wouldn't seek out praise or criticism.  She had known it was only a matter of time till  word got around. So now there were two names  floating about-Zeke's <i>and</i> Annie's. One a confessed  murderer and the other an artist born into the  wrong church district-or into the wrong family.... <p> Sarah Mae's expression was questioning, though she  spoke not the words Annie might have expected. "I  hope you won't be gone from home for too much  longer," she said softly. <p> "Mamm misses me, no doubt." There was that lump in  her throat again. <p> "Not only Mamm ..." Sarah Mae didn't need to say  more. <p> Annie knew. She, too, disliked the discord between  her father and herself. But could she make amends?  He was more than put out with her, and no wonder.  She had been too hasty in leaving, thinking only  of herself. Yet being with Essie and the children  was a blessing in disguise, a way to escape her  father's rigid expectations. <p> "I think it best that I stay put for the time  bein'," she said, leaning into the carriage.  "Especially since Essie needs me." <p> Sarah Mae sighed heavily, her bosom rising and  falling as if she were having difficulty catching  her breath. "I'm sure you've heard all 'bout Zeke,  then?" <p> "Some, but Essie doesn't know much yet. What does  Daed say?" <p> Sarah Mae hesitated. "Only that they're holding  Zeke until they can figure out if the bones are  really Isaac's. Though how on earth they'd do  that, I'll never know." <p> <i>Little Isaac's dead....</i> The hard, sad knowledge  slapped at Annie's brain every time she heard it. <p> "Daed's talkin' of sending a letter to Zeke's  father ... to let him know officially of Isaac's  death." There was a little catch in Sarah Mae's  voice, and she placed her hand over her mouth. <p> "I feel sorry for Daed," Annie said, "havin' to  break such sorrowful news." <p> Sarah Mae shook her head. "I can't imagine it. But  Daed already got his address up in Canada from  their cousin Nate, I guess." <p> Annie shivered. "I daresay Daed should wait till  Zeke's father gets over the death of his wife.  Seems only right ..." <p> "But who's to know if that will ever be." <p> "I s'pose," Annie said. "Honestly, can a man be  expected to suffer his wife's death and his son's  all in the space of a few weeks? Ain't like Daed  to jump ahead like this." <p> "Oh, your father's not the one insisting on  gettin' in touch with Isaac's father. This comes  down from higher up ... if you understand my  meaning." <p> Annie's gaze caught Sarah Mae's. "This is the  bishop's word, then?" <p> Sarah Mae's hand trembled. "I would not want my  husband or any man I know to be in Daniel  Hochstetler's shoes. But the brethren know best." <p> "I 'spect you're right." <p> "No, Annie, you <i>know</i> I'm right." <p> Annie stepped back, her anger rising suddenly at  the mention of the brethren. "Actually, I <i>don't</i>  know and that's the honest truth. Some days I  can't decide whether to cling to what I was always  taught or to reach for something altogether new."  She paused, recalling recent talks with Esther.  "Something that makes wonderful-good sense but  stirs up ever so much trouble. Ever think  thataway?" <p> A slow frown passed over Sarah Mae's face. "Can't  say I ever have, nee-no." <p> Annie felt an urgent need to step back, and she  did just that, waving good-bye. <p> "Aw, don't go away mad." <p> "Oh, I'm long past that," Annie said over her  shoulder, returning to Essie's horse and buggy ...  sorry she'd ever opened her mouth. <p>             * * * <p> When Annie arrived at her parents' house she knew,  even before detecting the pleading look in her  mother's eyes, that she was upset. Mamm had  pressed her hand against her cheek upon first  seeing Annie at the back door, although Annie  hadn't bothered to knock. She'd gone right in,  like she always had when living here. <p> The two of them sat at the table, drinking freshly  squeezed orange juice. Mamm's soft blue eyes were  somber, even intense. "Ach, Annie, 'tis gut seein'  you again." <p> "Oh, you, too, Mamm." Annie mentioned having seen  Sarah Mae out on the road on her way over. <p> "Jah, she stopped by on her way to market," Mamm  replied, staring at Annie still. <p> "Seems she's mighty worried 'bout Zeke. Which is  why I'm here. I just felt I might burst if I  didn't talk to you." <p> "Such a shame for all the People," Mamm said.  "Right startling, too, I daresay." <p> "Yet how can such a thing be true?" Annie paused,  wishing now she could right her own wrongs-leaving  home so impulsively for one. <p> "Just why would Zeke lie 'bout something so  awful?" Mamm said. "It makes not a bit of sense  that he would tell such a story-one that's near  impossible to believe. Unless he's ... not quite  right ... in his mind." <p> "Even so, if he says he killed Isaac, then who are  we to say he didn't?" <p> Mamm nodded slowly. "Jah, 'tis best not to judge." <p> Annie turned in her chair, wishing to lessen the  distress in her mother's gaze. "For the longest  time, I assumed Isaac was alive somewhere. Didn't  you?" She looked at Mamm, whose eyes were now  downcast. <p> "It's the most difficult thing, to think of your  child as gone forever." Mamm blinked back tears.  "In a way Mary Hochstetler's recent passing was a  godsend. She went to her grave unaware of the fact  of Isaac's death, though thinking him kidnapped  must've eaten her up inside." <p> "And she must have supposed, even known deep  within, that her little Isaac had passed over,  jah?" Seeing such grief imprinted on dear Mamm's  face, Annie swallowed back her own tears, not  wanting to add to her mother's sorrow. <p> "It is one thing, though, to lose a child that way  ... and quite another to lose one to her own  stubborn will." The words cut Annie to the quick. <p> "Oh, Mamm. I never left here out of spite. Surely  you know that." <p> Her mother's reply was slow and soft. "Even so  ..." <p> Annie rose and went to stand at the window  overlooking the backyard and the two-story barn's  lower entrance. "I 'spect you want me to talk to  Daed 'bout it?" <p> "Well, <i>shouldn't</i> you?" <p> Something winged up within, like a bird about to  soar. <i>I have no desire to say one word to him</i>.  "I've done too much damage already." <p> "You're his daughter, for goodness' sake! Why not  speak kindly to him ... see what can be done?" <p> Annie turned slowly. "I don't know if I can." <p> "Oh, Annie.... We miss you something awful." <p> Annie shook her head. "I can't talk 'bout this  now, Mamm." With that, she hurried out the back  door, hoping to find Yonie, the one brother who  had always under-stood her. <p> <p> <h3> Chapter Two </h3> In his parents' home in Kentucky, Ben Martin awoke  early with an unnamed dread. In spite of it, he  was determined to make a fresh start. Since  returning home, he had not been able to shake his  frustration at the way things had ended with  Annie. He missed seeing her, talking to her, and  spending time with her. He thought of her nearly  constantly. <p> He also thought of her bridge painting, the one  he'd stumbled upon in the Rancks' attic prior to  his leaving. As close as they had been, why had  Annie kept her artistry a secret from him? <p> Getting out of bed, he reached for his robe and  stepped to the window, staring out. Since  discovering Annie's painting, he often found  himself imagining her at work ... how she might  look as she pressed colored pencils or brush to  paper or canvas. Did she stand at her easel or sit  on a stool? Where did she work-at home or some  secret location? And when would she ever have the  time? Considering the great planning that would  have gone into the painting of the covered bridge,  he was baffled. With all the clamps put on Amish  women, he was surprised such self-expression was  permitted-or was it? Had she attempted to keep her  work hidden from view, just as she had hidden <i>him</i>  away, slipping out of her father's house and going  to their private rendezvous place? <p> He recalled her eagerness whenever she walked out  to meet him at his car. His heart had always  pounded at the sight of her, as well. Smiling at  the fond memory, he pictured a studio, unknown to  her father and the People, where Annie happily  hummed while drawing and painting. A cottage in  the woods, perhaps? Julia's attic, where he'd seen  the marvelous painting? And did she whisper to  herself in Pennsylvania Dutch as she worked? There  was much he wished to know about Annie-even more  so now that he was here and she, there. <p> He stared down at the street, glad for the  stillness before the neighborhood grew noisy.  There was no question in his mind that Paradise,  Pennsylvania, was as peaceful as any place he had  ever been. One of his dreams from the previous  night floated into his conscious memory&#58; he had  dreamed he was again walking through the covered  bridge over Pequea Creek. How long would it be  until his subconscious comprehended he was no  longer in Pennsylvania? <p> Ben shuffled to the bathroom. Picking up his  electric shaver, he wondered, <i>How would I look  with a full beard?</i> He stared at his reflection,  noticing the unusual dullness of his eyes.  Absentmindedly he began to shave, pondering the  fact that he'd never known how to go about  courting Annie Zook. At first, he figured he'd  just wing it, hoping all would go well. And it  certainly had, but only for a time. <p> Then, right when things between them had begun to  pick up speed and he was beginning to think she  might be falling for him, she'd cut him loose.  Even now his curiosity over what might have  happened if her father had not caught them  together was driving him a little crazy. <p> <i>If we hadn't taken the long way back that evening  ... if we hadn't run into Preacher Zook, I might  still be seeing her</i>. But her father had laid down  the law and she had chosen to obey him, denying  her own heart. <p> Ben wondered how he ever could have convinced  Annie to leave her world for his. In short, that  was the kicker. Nothing he imagined, either in the  hush of midnight or in the reality of early waking  hours, would ever change the cruel fact that they  simply were not meant to be together. After all,  it had been a no-no from the very beginning for  Annie to acknowledge his attention, let alone his  affection. Why couldn't he just accept that  Paradise was not his home and never would be? <p>            * * * <p> Later, after his two youngest sisters, Sherri and  Diana, had rushed off to school in Dad's old  beater, Ben washed breakfast dishes and  contemplated his plan of action. It was time to  get on with real life and stop fantasizing about  what might have been. He had always wanted to  extend himself to people in need, and he liked the  idea of doing something useful with his hands. So  building houses in a Third World country seemed  like a good way to go. If nothing else, it would  distract him and help get the preacher's daughter  out of his system. <p> He plodded across his mom's kitchen to the coffee  maker, poured another cup, then settled at the  table while his mother dried the dishes. "I've  been thinking about making a big change in my  life," he said. <p> "Getting married?" She turned from the sink to  wink at him. <p> "No, the Peace Corps." <p> Her grin faded but he rushed on. "I started  researching this possibility more than a year ago.  I think now might be a good time to apply." <i>Since  I can't have Annie</i>. <p> Mom froze in place at the sink, dish towel in  hand. "Oh, Ben," she said, shaking her head.  "Please ... you can't mean it." <p> "I'm entirely serious. I meet all the  requirements. They prefer people who speak more  than one language, but ..." <p> "Well, you <i>did</i>," Mom murmured, almost to herself.  "Not that it would help you any." <p> "What?" he asked, not understanding. <p> "Benjamin ..." she said, as if she had only enough  breath to form a single word. <p> She walked to the table and stood behind a chair  across from him, no doubt formulating her next  attempt to talk him out of it. "This doesn't make  sense. First you rush off to Pennsylvania for no  apparent reason, and now you're home for only a  few days and you want to volunteer overseas?" She  stared down at her hands, fingers tense as she  gripped the back of the chair. "Ben, please forget  this idea." <p> "Mom ..." <p> "I can't think of you leaving again. I can't-" <p> "Mom, relax. It won't be forever." But even as he  spoke, he was aware of the quiver of her lip, the  pallor of her face. <i>Why such a dramatic reaction?</i> <p> With a loud sigh, she pulled out the chair and sat  down. "I know your father will be glad when he  hears what I'm going to tell you. You see, it's  been a long time coming. Perhaps even too long." <p> He hoped whatever she was about to say was not as  alarming as her somber face seemed to forecast. <p> "Oh, honey, I don't know how to start.... This is  so difficult." She blinked fast, as if she might  cry. <p> "Mom? What is it?" <p> <i>(Continues...)</i> <p> <p>  </i></b></blockquote> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'> Excerpted from <b>The Brethren</b> by <b>Beverly Lewis</b> Copyright &copy; 2006  by Beverly Lewis.
