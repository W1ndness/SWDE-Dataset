In it she tells the story of a miraculous ocean encounter that happened to her when she was seventeen and in training for a big swim (she had already swum the English Channel, twice, and the Catalina Channel).
<p>
It was the dark of early morning; Lynne was in 55-degree water as smooth as black ice, two hundred yards offshore, outside the wave break. She was swimming her last half-mile back to the pier before heading home for breakfast when she became aware that something was swimming with her. The ocean was charged with energy as if a squall was moving in; thousands of baby anchovy darted through the water like lit sparklers, trying to evade something larger. Whatever it was, it felt large enough to be a white shark coursing beneath her body.<p>

It wasn't a shark. It became clear that it was a baby gray whale-following alongside Lynne for a mile or so. Lynne had been swimming for more than an hour; she needed to get out of the water to rest, but she realized that if she did, the young calf would follow her onto shore and die from collapsed lungs.<p>

The baby whale-eighteen feet long!-was migrating on a three-month trek to its feeding grounds in the Bering Sea, an eight-thousand-mile journey. It would have to be carried on its mother's back for much of that distance, and was dependent on its mother's milk for food-baby whales drink up to fifty gallons of milk a day. If Lynne didn't find the mother whale, the baby would suffer from dehydration and starve to death.<p>

Something so enormous-the mother whale was fifty feet long-suddenly seemed very small in the vast Pacific Ocean. How could Lynne possibly find her?<p>

This is the story-part mystery, part magical tale-of what happened . . .

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>On a clear California morning when Cox (Swimming to Antarctica)  was 17 years old, she had an unusual experience that stayed with  her for 30 years, creating a spiritual foundation for her  personal and professional success. In this slim and crisp  memoir, Cox details a morning swim off the coast of California  that took an unexpected turn: returning to shore, she discovered  that she was being followed by a baby gray whale that had been  separated from its mother. As Cox developed a rapport with the  whale, she took on the responsibility of keeping it at sea until  it was reunited with its mother. Cox expertly weaves fine  details together, from the whale's mushroomlike skin to how  other fish react to such a large creature. At times Cox's prose  is uneven, alternating from emotional to factual, but her pure  joy at connecting with Grayson (her name for the baby whale)  overrides any technical inconsistencies. The combination of  retelling her once-in-a-lifetime experience with her  observations on life ("If I try, if I believe, if I work toward  something... the impossible isn't impossible at all") will have  timeless appeal for all ages.

											Grayson turned out to be a great book.  It is hard to believe it is based on a true story.  A courageous 17 year old girl was able to help a baby whale find his mother after a 4 hour long swim in the ocean.  The connection this author had with a baby whale and mother whale makes a unique and exciting story.   It is a great book if you love nature too, because of the connection and energy between humans and these amazing animals.  Not to mention her whole swim was filled with nature from sea creatures to the gorgeous area of LA/ Catalina Island, California.  I loved this authors journey and this book will sweep you away on an exciting ocean adventure.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Good Book!<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1288398_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781615604821_BK_2_1288398" href="#previewReview_1288398" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>January 21, 2010: 
											There were many positives and negatives in this book. For example, I really liked<p/>the long, descriptive sentences. Also, I thought that the appearance of the book was <p/>very beautiful, from the outside pictures, to the text. The last positive that I can think of <p/>now is that it was a very amazing story, and it shows lots of feeling. Some of the <p/>negatives included ow it loses excitement and the urgency of finding the mom by de<p/>scribing too much. Also, I know that since it was a true story, and I can't really change <p/>the plot, but I thought that it was kind of weird that Lynne wasn't monitored as much as <p/>she should have been in such a dangerous situation. Lastly, I thought that the book was <p/>very interesting, but if it were shorter, it would have been more exciting and would have <p/>kept my interest more.<p/> Many authors have their own writing styles. The author, Lynne Cox, has many <p/>things that make up her own writing style. First of all, she has very long sentences with <p/>descriptive words. One sentence that shows this says, "There's something frightening, <p/>and magical, about being in the ocean, moving between the heavens and the earth, <p/>knowing that you can encounter anything on your journey." Also, Cox uses lots of flash<p/>backs in her writing. One of her flashbacks was about the grunion mating, and how she <p/>and her friends would sit and wait all night for the grunion to come out to the beach and <p/>breed. Lastly, Lynne Cox writes using the first-person, which is when she says "I did. . ." <p/>instead of "Lynne did. . .". Those are some of the topics that make up Lynne Cox's <p/>writing style.<p/> I would recommend this book for many reasons. First, it was a very true story <p/>that was short, but it had many details that made it seem longer than it actually was. <p/>Also, it could be an adult, or a children's book because it was very mature, yet easy to <p/>read at the same time. Lastly, this book's appearance was magnificent, because it has a <p/>very intriguing cover and very interesting pages. Some similar novels that I would rec<p/>commend include Moby Dick by Herman Melville, The Green Glass Sea by Ellen <p/>Klages, and Hawke by Ted Belle. Other good books that I have read are Lock and Key <p/>by Sarah Dessen, The Canterwood Crest Series by Jessica Burkhart, and Each Little <p/>Bird That Sings by Deborah Wiles. Lock and Key, by Sarah Dessen, is about a girl <p/>named Ruby who goes to live with her sister (Who was once her best friend) after her <p/>mother left her. The Canterwood Crest Series is about a girl named Sasha Silver who <p/>starts out 7th grade at a private school called Canterwood Crest and is on the horse<p/>back riding team there. Each Little Bird That Sings is about Comfort Snowberger, a girl <p/>who's family own a funeral home, and all of her adventures with her family.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Green-Glass-Sea/Ellen-Klages/e/9780142411490/?pv=y">The Green Glass Sea</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Lock-and-Key/Sarah-Dessen/e/9780142414729/?pv=y">Lock and Key</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Each-Little-Bird-That-Sings/Deborah-Wiles/e/9780152056575/?pv=y">Each Little Bird That Sings</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Little-White-Lies/Jessica-Burkhart/e/9781416990383/?pv=y">Little White Lies (Canterwood Crest Series #6)</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Moby-Dick/Herman-Melville/e/9781593080181/?pv=y">Moby-Dick (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics Series)</a>. </p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>In 1975, Lynne Cox hadn't yet been elected to the Swimming Hall of Fame or achieved international renown as the author of <i>Swimming to Antarctica</i>. She was just a teenage swimming prodigy, training to eclipse the Catalina Channel world record. One morning, completing a predawn swim in chilly California waters, she realized that she had somehow picked up an unbidden companion: a baby gray whale. She knew that if she did the wrong thing and swam into shore, the 18-foot baby would beach itself and die. This magical tale tells how Lynne Cox did the right thing. It's one of the sweetest and most fascinating animal stories in years.
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><i>Grayson</i> is Lynne Cox's first book since <i>Swimming to Antarctica</i> ("Riveting"-<i>Sports Illustrated;</i> "Pitch-perfect"-<i>Outside</i>). In it she tells the story of a miraculous ocean encounter that happened to her when she was seventeen and in training for a big swim (she had already swum the English Channel, twice, and the Catalina Channel).
<p>
It was the dark of early morning; Lynne was in 55-degree water as smooth as black ice, two hundred yards offshore, outside the wave break. She was swimming her last half-mile back to the pier before heading home for breakfast when she became aware that something was swimming with her. The ocean was charged with energy as if a squall was moving in; thousands of baby anchovy darted through the water like lit sparklers, trying to evade something larger. Whatever it was, it felt large enough to be a white shark coursing beneath her body.<p>

It wasn't a shark. It became clear that it was a baby gray whale-following alongside Lynne for a mile or so. Lynne had been swimming for more than an hour; she needed to get out of the water to rest, but she realized that if she did, the young calf would follow her onto shore and die from collapsed lungs.<p>

The baby whale-eighteen feet long!-was migrating on a three-month trek to its feeding grounds in the Bering Sea, an eight-thousand-mile journey. It would have to be carried on its mother's back for much of that distance, and was dependent on its mother's milk for food-baby whales drink up to fifty gallons of milk a day. If Lynne didn't find the mother whale, the baby would suffer from dehydration and starve to death.<p>

Something so enormous-the mother whale was fifty feet long-suddenly seemed very small in the vast Pacific Ocean. How could Lynne possibly find her?<p>

This is the story-part mystery, part magical tale-of what happened . . .

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>On a clear California morning when Cox (Swimming to Antarctica)  was 17 years old, she had an unusual experience that stayed with  her for 30 years, creating a spiritual foundation for her  personal and professional success. In this slim and crisp  memoir, Cox details a morning swim off the coast of California  that took an unexpected turn: returning to shore, she discovered  that she was being followed by a baby gray whale that had been  separated from its mother. As Cox developed a rapport with the  whale, she took on the responsibility of keeping it at sea until  it was reunited with its mother. Cox expertly weaves fine  details together, from the whale's mushroomlike skin to how  other fish react to such a large creature. At times Cox's prose  is uneven, alternating from emotional to factual, but her pure  joy at connecting with Grayson (her name for the baby whale)  overrides any technical inconsistencies. The combination of  retelling her once-in-a-lifetime experience with her  observations on life ("If I try, if I believe, if I work toward  something... the impossible isn't impossible at all") will have  timeless appeal for all ages.

								VOYA</h3><p>Predawn swimming in fifty-degree water off the coast of California was routine for seventeen-year-old Lynne Cox. But for Cox, the author of Swimming to Antarctica (Knopf, 2004), one morning workout became anything but typical when she discovered an eighteen-foot baby gray whale swimming with her. Continuing to shore would spell doom for the whale if he followed, so Cox decided that even though she was already exhausted, she would stay in the water to help the baby whale, whom she named "Grayson," find his mother. Despite a number of setbacks and moments of near panic when she lost sight of Grayson for significant amounts of time, Cox refused to give up. Drawing on her inner strength and optimism, she kept going, thinking that "If I try, if I believe, if I work toward something . . . the impossible isn't impossible at all.o Cox's remarkable journey and amazing encounters with all variety of ocean life, including a particularly vivid and moving description of a large group of dolphins "just clowning around," clearly illustrate why the experience has remained etched in the memory of the famous long-distance swimmer for more than thirty years. Her lyrical prose, understated wisdom, and obvious reverence and respect for the ocean and everything that lives in it give the story a spiritual feel. Although the initial chapters lack the suspense and action of the latter half of the book, teens who stick with this quiet tale of hope and perseverance will be richly rewarded.

</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p>Adult/High School-In a simple but suspenseful narrative, the  author recounts her mystical encounter with a baby whale and his  mother on a March morning 30 years ago. Then 17 years old, Cox  was just completing her swim off Seal Beach, CA, and heading  toward shore when the ocean became unusually rough and swarming  with small fish. A large animal that she at first mistook for a  shark was swimming just beneath her. In fact, it was an  18-foot-long baby gray whale. Cox was frightened and then  enchanted by the playful creature that seemed to want to follow  her to shore, an act that would be fatal for him. She developed  an emotional bond with the whale she calls Grayson, guiding him  away from the shore. Both teen and calf were hungry, fatigued,  and dehydrated, but Cox, frozen to the bone in 55-degree water,  was determined to find the baby's mother. With incredible  optimism and courage, and the guidance and encouragement of  nearby fishermen and lifeguards, Cox finally united Grayson with  his huge, barnacled parent. This true adventure is as  breathtaking as the exotic underwater life that the author  describes in vivid detail.-Jackie Gropman, Chantilly Regional  Library, Fairfax County, VA   Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>In a sequel of sorts to Swimming to Antarctica (2004), renowned distance swimmer Cox tells the story of an ordinary practice swim that took a decidedly extraordinary turn. She was about to wrap up her workout when she realized that she was being followed by a baby whale, who had somehow been separated from his mother. Cox was dog-tired, but realized that if she came ashore, the whale would try to follow her and would die. So she stayed in the water for hours, swimming around with the baby she dubbed Grayson, waiting and watching and hoping his mother would return. Cox vividly recreates the experience of the exhausting swim. Commenting on her hunger, she writes: "All I wanted was a . . . cup of hot chocolate with a mound of whipped cream as big as Big Bear Mountain in the distance . . . or carrot cake with pecans and cinnamon and clove, pineapple and coconut, or a slice of hot apple strudel-any of these would do." The narrative transports readers to the majestic, wonderful world of the ocean, filled with dolphins, small fish and odd plants. When Grayson's mother finally turns up, Cox is astounded by her size, her girth, the barnacles on her chin, the rubbery roughness of her cheek. Still, transforming the story of one afternoon into a book-length fable, even a short book-length fable, is a bit of a stretch. The tale is burdened with overwrought musings on the meaning of the time spent with Grayson: "The waiting is as important as the doing; it's the time you spend training and the rest in between; it's the painting the subject and the space in between." Nonetheless, an inspirational, almost spiritual read, perfect for gift-giving. First printing of 100,000

Maybe energy from distant winds and torrential rains was being transmitted through the water.<br><br>I checked the sky above and the distant horizon.<br><br>Both were dull and as black as ink and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.<br><br>I lifted my head to see the wave height. The shore break wasn't increasing and there weren't any wind waves. Not even dimples on the ocean's surface. There was no sign of a storm.<br><br>It didn't make sense. The energy in the water was intensifying. I felt like I was sitting on a tree branch beside a nest of angry, buzzing bumblebees.<br><br>All at once, the sea's surface erupted nearby. There was a rushing and plunking sound.<br><br>Like raindrops hitting the water. But nothing was falling from the sky. This was wrong.<br><br>Very wrong.<br><br>Out of the darkness, things were flapping into my face, flicking off my arms and head. It was like swimming through a sea of locusts, and with each impact my muscles tightened. I was tingling with fear, and all I wanted to do was to turn and sprint for shore.<br><br>But I told myself, Stay calm. You need to focus. You need to figure out what this is.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, I looked down into the deep black sea.<br><br>Thousands of baby anchovy were darting through the water like lit sparklers.<br><br>Blinded by panic, they were frantically tearing away from their schools and leaping out of the ocean like popcorn cooking on high heat. They were trying to evade something larger.<br><br>Light was exploding around me like hundreds of tiny blue flashbulbs constantly firing.<br><br>When I turned my head to breathe, something leaped into my mouth, wiggled across my tongue, and flapped between my teeth. It was larger than the water bug I once inhaled on a lake in Maine, larger than an anchovy.<br><br>Without thinking I spat it back into the sea. It had bright silver sides and was about six inches long. It was a grunion, a fish nearly twice as large as the baby anchovy. The grunion were chasing the anchovy, snatching them from the water and swallowing them whole.<br><br>More grunion were swimming in, bumping into my thighs, raking their pointy fins across my shoulders, but I smiled. The grunion had returned. Every year the grunion return to California in the spring and summer. They wait just offshore for the full moons or new moons when the tide is high, so they can swim ashore and lay their eggs. It always seems to be a miracle that they return every year and know exactly where and when to swim ashore.<br><br>A lone male grunion, a scout, swims ahead, and if the coast is clear, hundreds of female grunion follow him in, each with as many as eight male grunion swimming alongside. They choose a special wave, one that is on the receding tide so that it will carry them higher onto the beach, and the female's eggs will not be washed out to sea.<br><br>Once a female reaches the beach, she digs a hole in the sand with her tail, then wiggles back and forth, drilling herself down into the soft wet sand until she is buried all the way up to her lips. There she lays up to three thousand eggs, and one of the male grunion arches around her and releases his milt to fertilize the eggs. Then the adult grunion swim back to sea while the eggs incubate in the warm sand for ten days. Then the baby grunion hatch and ride the tide back out to sea to begin their lives in the ocean.<br><br>I loved to watch them come ashore and I loved to go grunion hunting. It was a big event in Southern California. In summer, I would meet friends on the beach on moonlit nights and wait for the grunion. We'd spread our large bright-striped beach blankets on a berm, at the crest in the beach, beyond the reach of the incoming waves. We'd sit wrapped up in more warm woolly blankets, sometimes alone, or sometimes snuggled up with friends to stave off the cool, damp swirling ocean breezes. We'd talk, in muffled tones so no one would scare the fish away, about boyfriends and girlfriends, about summer plans and BBQs, about our lives and our families, our dreams and how we felt. We'd explore our lives, and sometimes touch hands under the blanket. We, too, were restless, awaiting our own high tide.<br><br>Someone in our group would whisper excitedly, "There he is!"<br><br>We'd jump to our feet, scanning the beach for a single fish. When we spotted one flopping on the sand, we'd watch and wait for what seemed like forever. Then a few minutes later, a wave would lift hundreds of grunion up. This wave would be so heavily laden with fish, it would rise more slowly than any other. As it curled, its dark glassy face would be altered by hundreds of grunion heads and tails protruding at all angles.<br><br>The wave would crash onshore and the grunion would spin and tumble across the sand, flipping, flopping, and pulling themselves beyond the water's edge. Their gills would beat in and out as they gasped for air. It seemed amazing to me that they could hold their breath for two or three minutes, and that they had to leave the sea and return to shore to continue the cycle of life. In utter fascination we'd watch this dance.<br><br>As soon as the grunion finished laying their eggs, they'd flip and flop back toward the water, and at that moment we'd charge across the sand, kicking mud on the backs of our legs and trying to scoop the grunion up with our bare hands.<br><br>They were always slippery, squirmy, and quick and harder to hold on to than a warm cube of butter. My friends and I might catch a few grunion, but none of us had the heart to take them home and cook them with a dusting of cornmeal and eat them as some people did. Somehow that would have spoiled the magic of all that we had witnessed. We were happy to catch them in our hands, feel the pulse of life racing through their bodies, and release them back into the warm salty waves.<br><br>As I swam I felt a strong connection with the agile schools of grunion and I thought I was lucky to be swimming with them--until I realized that they were attracting a small school of albacore tuna.<br><br>Usually the tuna lived and migrated twenty miles or more off the coast, but the abundance of food had lured them in. Albacore tuna are large fish. They weigh between twenty and forty pounds. They are shaped like giant oval beech leaves and have dark blue backs and gray-blue sides and bellies. They are very fast swimmers&#58; they swim as if they are turbocharged.<br><br>At first I enjoyed feeling the way the water wavered and yawed as the tuna zipped to the right and left of me. But when they started leaping out of the water to catch the grunion, I grew concerned. I didn't want to be hit by a forty-pound tuna. I pulled to the right and then off to the left, but they were everywhere.<br><br>Then it happened. A big tuna weighing maybe twenty-five pounds rocketed out of the water. He smacked into my back and I jumped very high. Then another bounced off my shoulders. I started giggling. I had to roll on my side and catch my breath. It was raining tuna. What a weird, wild, and wonderful thing.<br><br>It occurred to me that these tuna would probably attract larger fish and the only larger fish I could think of were sharks. So I decided to move closer to shore, away from the feeding throngs. As I got nearer to land I started watching what was happening in the homes on the north side of the pier.<br><br>People were starting to get up. Second-floor windows that had been dark gray and vacant were becoming large glowing squares of gold, and as the people moved into their bathrooms and then downstairs more windows became gold squares. I imagined how warm it must be inside those homes. I let my mind enfold me in that golden warmth.<br><br>I was cold. The Pacific water temperature in March is in the mid-fifties; the surrounding water was constantly pulling heat from my body. It was like being wrapped up in a warm blanket on a snowy day and then having someone pull the blanket off. To overcome the heat loss, I had to swim at a rate fast enough to create heat, but still my skin always felt cold; it was as cold as the water. I could feel the cold working its way deep into my muscles.<br><br>An offshore breeze carried the warm sweet smells of smoky bacon and fried eggs, buttery pancakes, and the rich acidic aroma of brewing coffee across the water. I had been swimming for more than an hour and my stomach was grumbling loudly. All I had to do was reach the north jetty, turn around, and swim the last half mile back to the pier and then I'd be finished with my workout.<br><br>I was starting to relax, stretching out my arms, feeling my hands and arms pulling the thick water, feeling the rotation of my shoulders and core, and the light kick of my feet. My body was slipping through the water like silk sliding across ultrasmooth skin. My breaths were long and easy, and I felt good&#58; I was back into my pace, moving with the flow of all creation. Everything was in sync, the currents flowing around me, the song of the ocean, the breeze--except everything below was strangely still.<br><br>All the fish had disappeared.<br><br>Lifting my head, I looked to my right and then to my left. I couldn't see anything. I put my face back down, and stared into the water through clear goggles. It was like looking into a well at midnight. I couldn't see anything, but I knew something was there.<br><br>The water began shaking harder than before and I was being churned up and down as if I was swimming through a giant washing machine. The water shifted, and I was riding on the top of a massive bubble. It was moving directly up from below, putting out a high-energy vibration. I felt like there was a spaceship moving right below me. I had never felt anything this big in the water before. </i></b></blockquote> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Grayson</b> by <b>Lynne Cox</b> Excerpted by permission.<br> All rights reserved.
