Now, ten years later, he has come home to the Gold Coast, that stretch of land on the North Shore of Long Island that once held the greatest concentration of wealth and power in America, to attend the imminent funeral of an old family servant. Taking up temporary residence in the gatehouse of Stanhope Hall, John finds himself living only a quarter of a mile from Susan who has also returned to Long Island. But Susan isn't the only person from John's past who has reemerged&#58; Though Frank Bellarosa, infamous Mafia don and Susan's ex-lover, is long dead, his son, Anthony, is alive and well, and intent on two missions&#58; Drawing John back into the violent world of the Bellarosa family, and exacting revenge on his father's murderer--Susan Sutter. At the same time, John and Susan's mutual attraction resurfaces and old passions begin to reignite, and John finds himself pulled deeper into a familiar web of seduction and betrayal. In THE GATE HOUSE, acclaimed author Nelson Demille brings us back to that fabled spot on the North Shore -- a place where past, present, and future collides with often unexpected results.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>DeMille's follow-up to his bestselling <I>The Gold Coast</I> features protagonist John Sutter falling back into old habits and acquaintances as he comes home to Long Island. Narrator Christian Rummel gives an awkward reading, struggling to capture the character of Sutter through a voice that sounds manufactured and often uneasy. Rummel fares slightly better with supporting characters such as Sutter's ex-wife, though the first-person narrative from Sutter's perspective ensures that most of the novel is read with that same nervous tone. Rummel never finds his groove, eternally searching for the proper narrative tone that will captivate the audience. <I>A Grand Central hardcover (Reviews, Aug. 18).

											After reading the many negative reviews on this site, I entered the reading experience here with trepidation.  First a quick summary.  'The Gate House' is a sequel to the superb novel 'The Gold Coast'.  Like most sequels it is not as good as its predecessor.  And like most sequels it shares many of the same characters.  This second characteristic is what saves this book.<p/><p/>The John Whitman Sutter character was appealing in the first book because of his strength of character, wit and intelligence, all of which are severely tested in 'The Gold Coast'. While that novel is almost an updating of 'Gatsby' in many respects, narrator John Sutter is far more appealing than Fitzgerald's sycophantic Nick Carraway.  He is perhaps more reminiscent of Lawrence Sanders' Archie McNally in personality and wit.<p/><p/>'The Gate House' ties up loose ends from the previous novel and features John Whitman Sutter and his ex-wife Susan.  The catalyst for a reuniting of the characters is the impending death of an old lifelong estate employee. The book could have been about 100 pages shorter, and there were a few too many in-law jokes, even though most were clever.  The ending plot resolutions happen quickly and are both expected and surprising after pages of static plot.  I would recommend that anyone reading this book should definitely read 'The Gold Coast' first.  Not only is it a far better book but it will make the reading of 'The Gate House' a much more satisfying experience.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Give it a few minutes<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=mamastrick">mamastrick</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1385052_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780446564236_BK_1_1385052" href="#previewReview_1385052" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 14, 2010: 
											I attempted to read this book twice and it didn't hook me in the first few pages.  The third time, everything was quiet and I could concentrate better and I really got into the story after a few more pages.  As I read, I found myself laughing out loud at some DeMille's wit.  He has such a unique style which draw you to his characters.  There is a struggle with John Sutter and his decisions but he is so imperfect that you find yourself cheering him on.   There are scary moments in the book and DeMille's descriptions are done so well that you can sympathize with the characters and you feel their fear, their anger and hatred like you know them and their adversaries.  I was sad when the book was over, but it did spend lots of time on background.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Lion/Nelson-DeMille/e/9780446580830/?pv=y">The Lion</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Gold-Coast/Nelson-DeMille/e/9780446673211/?pv=y">The Gold Coast</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Plum-Island/Nelson-DeMille/e/9780446679084/?pv=y">Plum Island</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Great-Gatsby/F-Scott-Fitzgerald/e/9780743273565/?pv=y">The Great Gatsby</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/McNallys-Secret/Lawrence-Sanders/e/9780743565325/?pv=y">McNally's Secret</a>. </p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35705340.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Nelson DeMille</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>Jack Cannon; Kurt Ladner; Brad Matthews; Michael Weaver; Ellen Kay</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Long Island, New York</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>August 22, 1943</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>New York, New York</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A. in political science, Hofstra University, 1974</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Honorary doctorates from Hofstra University, Long Island University and Dowling College; Estabrook Award</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.nelsondemille.net/">* Nelson DeMille's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Nelson DeMille has a dozen bestselling novels to his name and over 30 million books in print worldwide, but his beginnings were not so illustrious. Writing police detective novels in the mid-1970s, DeMille created the pseudonym Jack Cannon: "I used the pen name because I knew I wanted to write better novels under my own name someday," DeMille told fans in a 2000 chat. <p>Between 1966 and 1969, Nelson DeMille served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. When he came home, he finished his undergraduate studies (in history and political science), then set out to become a novelist. "I wanted to write the great American war novel at the time," DeMille said in an interview with <I>January</I> magazine. "I never really wrote the book, but it got me into the writing process." A friend in the publishing industry suggested he write a series of police detective novels, which he did under a pen name for several years.     <p>Finally DeMille decided to give up his day job as an insurance fraud investigator and commit himself to writing full time -- and under his own name. The result was <I>By the Rivers of Babylon</I> (1978), a thriller about terrorism in the Middle East. It was chosen as a Book of the Month Club main selection and helped launch his career. "It was like being knighted," said DeMille, who now serves as a Book of the Month Club judge. "It was a huge break." </p>    <p>DeMille followed it with a stream of bestsellers, including the post-Vietnam courtroom drama <I>Word of Honor</I> (1985) and the Cold War spy-thriller <I>The Charm School</I> (1988) Critics praised DeMille for his sophisticated plotting, meticulous research and compulsively readable style. For many readers, what made DeMille stand out was his sardonic sense of humor, which would eventually produce the wisecracking ex-NYPD officer John Corey, hero of <I>Plum Island</I> (1997) and <I>The Lion's Game</I> (2000).     <p>In 1990 DeMille published <I>The Gold Coast</I>,  a Tom Wolfe-style comic satire that was his attempt to write "a book that would be taken seriously." The attempt succeeded, in terms of the critics' response: "In his way, Mr. DeMille is as keen a social satirist as Edith Wharton," wrote <I>The New York Times</I> book reviewer. But he returned to more familiar thrills-and-chills territory in <I>The General's Daughter</I>,  which hit no. 1 on <I>The New York Times'</I> Bestseller list and was made into a movie starring John Travolta. Its hero, army investigator Paul Brenner, returned in <I>Up Country</I> (2002), a book inspired in part by DeMille's journey to his old battlegrounds in Vietnam.     <p>DeMille's position in the literary hierarchy may be ambiguous, but his talent is first-rate; there's no questioning his mastery of his chosen form. As a reviewer for the <I>Denver Post</I> put it, "In the rarefied world of the intelligent thriller, authors just don't get any better than Nelson DeMille."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>DeMille composes</b> his books in longhand, using soft-lead pencils on legal pads. He says he does this because he can't type, but adds, "I like the process of pencil and paper as opposed to a machine. I think the writing is better when it's done in handwriting."    <p><b>In addition to his novels,</b> DeMille has written a play for children based on the classic fairy tale "Rumpelstiltskin."   <p>  <b>DeMille says</b> on his web site that he reads mostly dead authors -- "so if I like their books, I don't feel tempted or obligated to write to them." He mentions writing to a living author, Tom Wolfe, when The Bonfire of the Vanities came out; but Wolfe never responded. "I wouldn't expect Hemingway or Steinbeck to write back -- they're dead. But Tom Wolfe owes me a letter," DeMille writes.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>Nelson DeMille gave us some insight on his (surprisingly thriller-free) literary tastes and favorite pastimes.</i><p>    <b>What was the book that influenced your life the most, and why?</b><br>  <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> by Ayn Rand.

Now, ten years later, he has come home to the Gold Coast, that stretch of land on the North Shore of Long Island that once held the greatest concentration of wealth and power in America, to attend the imminent funeral of an old family servant.

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>DeMille's follow-up to his bestselling <I>The Gold Coast</I> features protagonist John Sutter falling back into old habits and acquaintances as he comes home to Long Island. Narrator Christian Rummel gives an awkward reading, struggling to capture the character of Sutter through a voice that sounds manufactured and often uneasy. Rummel fares slightly better with supporting characters such as Sutter's ex-wife, though the first-person narrative from Sutter's perspective ensures that most of the novel is read with that same nervous tone. Rummel never finds his groove, eternally searching for the proper narrative tone that will captivate the audience. <I>A Grand Central hardcover (Reviews, Aug. 18).

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p><P>In this long-awaited but ponderous sequel to <I>The Gold Coast</I> (1990), it is ten years later, and John Sutter has returned for the funeral of a woman who isn't dead yet. He's also looking to restart his life and possibly hook up with his ex-wife, Susan, who'd had an affair with a local Mafia don she later killed. Confounding the problem is the don's son, who has taken over the family business and wants vengeance against both John and Susan. While there are interesting characters, and Sutter's first-person observations are clever, it takes forever for the action to get going. Even an exciting climax doesn't help. DeMille has developed a reputation for fast-paced action thrillers, and this is neither. His name will guarantee a level of success, and those patrons who enjoyed reading about the lives of the rich and decadent in <I>The Gold Coast</I> will enjoy this sequel. The rest will hope DeMille's next effort is more compelling. For larger collections. [See Prepub Alert, <I>LJ</I> 6/15/08.]-Robert Conroy, Warren, MI</I> </P>
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>More good-natured tough-guy fiction from regular-as-clockwork novelist DeMille (Wild Fire, 2006, etc.). When readers left lawyer and freelance gumshoe John Sutter at the end of The Gold Coast (1990), he was a most unhappy man: His wife had been, well, dallying with the Mafia don who had hired him to sort out his taxes, something had gone amiss in the relationship and said wife had filled said don with lead. In the intervening years, it seems, Sutter has sailed around the world with an eye to finding paradise and staying far away from the Long Island shore, winding up in London advising British barristers that "screwing the Internal Revenue Service was an American tradition." Post 9/11, some thought of Americanness has drawn him back, and, this being a postmodern era, he has returned to living on the Gold Coast in the estate of his ex, the ever-luscious Susan Stanhope Sutter, who somehow has escaped the justice that would be meted out to us poor folk and instead is having her nails done at liberty. But then life gets complicated, as it does: The don's son and heir, a toughie named Anthony Bellarosa, insinuates himself into Sutter's life to get at Susan, who, meanwhile, has been visiting Sutter in the gate house at all hours and in all states of dress and undress. The characters are just shy of stock. It's not just that they have more money, but that they really do live like the characters in The Great Gatsby, save here with more guns and considerably more intricate plots involving one another. The rich are different from you and me, DeMille instructs in this lightweight entertainment, where nearly every element can be seen coming from a long way off.

Paumanok, incidentally, is the indigenous Indian word   for Long Island, and my illustrious ancestor, Walt Whitman, a native Long   Islander, sometimes used this word in his poetry-and if Uncle Walt had owned a   forty-six-foot yacht, I'm sure he'd have christened it the <i>Paumanok</i>, not "I Hear   America Singing," which is too long to put on the stern, or <i>Leaves of Grass</i>,   which doesn't sound seaworthy.  <p>  Anyway, my last port of call was Bournemouth, England, from which my other   distant ancestors, the Sutters, had set sail for America three centuries before.  <p>  With winter coming on, and sea fatigue in my bones, a dwindling bank account,   and my wanderlust satisfied, I sold the boat for about half what it was worth   and moved up to London to look for a job, eventually signing on with a British   law firm that needed an American tax lawyer, which is what I was in New York   before I became captain of the <i>Paumanok II</i>.  <p>  I spread out some photos of Susan on the table and looked at them under the   light of the chandelier. Susan was, and probably still is, a beautiful woman   with long red hair, arresting green eyes, pouty lips, and the perfect body of a   lifelong equestrian.  <p>  I picked up a photo that showed Susan on my first sailboat, the original   <i>Paumanok</i>, a thirty-six-foot Morgan, which I loved, but which I'd scuttled in   Oyster Bay Harbor rather than let the government seize it for back taxes. This   photo was taken, I think, in the summer of 1990 somewhere on the Long Island   Sound. The photograph showed a bright summer day, and Susan was standing on the   aft deck, stark naked, with one hand covering her burning bush, and the other   covering one breast. Her face shows an expression of mock surprise and   embarrassment.  <p>  The occasion was one of Susan's acted-out sexual fantasies, and I think I was   supposed to have climbed aboard from a kayak, and I'd discovered her alone and   naked and made her my sex slave.  <p>  The woman had not only a great body, but also a great imagination and a   wonderful libido to go with it. As for the sexual playacting, its purpose, of   course, was to keep the marital fires burning, and it worked well for almost two   decades because all our infidelities were with each other. At least that was the   understanding, until a new actor, don Frank Bellarosa, moved in next door.  <p>  I picked up a bottle of old cognac that I'd found in the sideboard and topped   off my coffee cup.  <p>  The reason I've returned to America has to do with the former residents of this   gatehouse, George and Ethel Allard, who had been old Stanhope family retainers.   George, a good man, had died a decade ago, and his wife, Ethel, who is not so   nice, is in hospice care and about to join her husband, unless George has   already had a word with St. Peter, the ultimate gatekeeper. "Wasn't I promised   eternal rest and peace? Can't she go someplace else? She always liked hot   weather." In any case, I am the attorney for Ethel's estate and so I needed to   take care of that and attend her funeral.  <p>  The other reason I've returned is that this gatehouse is my legal U.S. address,   but unfortunately, this house is about to pass into the hands of Amir Nasim, an   Iranian gentleman who now owns the main house, Stanhope Hall, and much of the   original acreage, including this gatehouse. As of now, however, Ethel Allard has   what is called a life estate in the gatehouse, meaning she has a rent-free   tenancy until she dies. This rent-free house was given to her by Susan's   grandfather, Augustus Stanhope (because Ethel was screwing Augustus way back   when), and Ethel has been kind enough to allow me to store my things here and   share her digs whenever I'm in New York. Ethel hates me, but that's another   story. In any case, Ethel's tenancy in this house and on this planet is about to   end, and thus I had returned from London not only to say goodbye to Ethel, but   also to find a new home for my possessions, and find another legal U.S. address,   which seems to be a requirement for citizenship and creditors.  <p>  This is the first time I'd been to New York since last September, coming in from   London as soon as the airplanes were flying again. I'd stayed for three days at   the Yale Club, where I'd maintained my membership for my infrequent New York   business trips, and I was shocked at how quiet, empty, and somber the great city   had become.  <p>  I'd made no phone calls and saw no one. I would have seen my daughter, Carolyn,   but she had fled her apartment in Brooklyn right after 9/11 to stay with her   mother in Hilton Head, South Carolina. My son, Edward, lives in Los Angeles. So   for three days, I walked the quiet streets of the city, watching the smoke   rising from what came to be known as Ground Zero.  <p>  Heartsick and drained, I got on a plane and returned to London, feeling that I'd   done the right thing, the way people do who come home for a death in the family.  <p>  Over the next few months, I learned that I knew eleven people who'd died in the   Twin Towers; mostly former neighbors and business associates, but also a close   friend who left a wife and three young children.  <p>  And now, nine months after 9/11, I was back again. Things seemed to have   returned to normal, but not really.  <p>  I sipped my coffee and cognac and looked around at the piles of paper. There was   a lot to go through, and I hoped that Ethel would hold on a while longer, and   that Mr. Nasim wasn't planning on getting his encumbered gatehouse into his   possession the minute Ethel's life tenancy expired. I needed to speak to Mr.   Nasim about that; speaking to Ethel about hanging on until I tidied up my papers   might seem insensitive and selfish.  <p>  Because the night was cool, and because I didn't have a paper shredder, I had a   fire going in the dining room fireplace. Now and then, I'd feed the fire with   some letter or photo that I wouldn't want my children to see if I suddenly   croaked.  <p>  In that category were these photos of their mother whose nakedness revealed a   lot more about her head than about her body. Susan was, and I'm sure still is, a   bit nutty. But to be honest, I didn't mind that at all, and that wasn't the   source of our marital problems. Our problem, obviously, was Susan's affair with   the Mafia don next door. And then to complicate things further, she shot and   killed him. Three shots. One in the groin. Ouch.  <p>  I gathered the photos and turned in my chair toward the fireplace. We all have   trouble parting with things like this, but I can tell you, as a lawyer and as a   man, no good can come of saving anything you wouldn't want your family or your   enemies to see. Or your next significant other, for that matter.  <p>  I stared into the fire and watched the flames dancing against the soot-blackened   brick, but I held on to the photos.  <p>  So, she shot her lover, Frank "the Bishop" Bellarosa, capo di tutti capi, boss   of all bosses, and got away with it-legally, at least-due to some circumstances   that the Justice Department found mitigating and extenuating.  <p>  Fact is, the Justice Department took a dive on the case because they'd made the   mistake of allowing Mrs. Sutter unobstructed access to don Bellarosa, who was   under house arrest in his villa down the road, and who was also singing his   black heart out to them, and thus needed to be kept happy with another man's   wife.  <p>  I'm still a little pissed off at the whole thing, as you might guess, but   basically I'm over it.  <p>  Meanwhile, I needed to decide if this trip was a death vigil, or perhaps   something more permanent. I had kept up with my CLE-continuing legal   education-and I was still a member of the New York State Bar, so I hadn't burned   all my bridges, and theoretically I was employable here. In my last life, I had   been a partner in my father's old firm of Perkins, Perkins, Sutter and Reynolds,   still located at 23 Wall Street, a historic building that was once bombed by   Anarchists at the turn of the last century, which seems almost quaint in light   of 9/11.  <p>  For the last seven years in London, I'd worked for the aforementioned British   law firm, and I was their American tax guy who explained that screwing the   Internal Revenue Service was an American tradition. This was payback for me   because the IRS had screwed up my life, while my wife was screwing the Mafia   don. These two seemingly disparate problems were actually related, as I had   found out the hard way.  <p>  I guess I'd hit a patch of rough road back then, a little adversity in an   otherwise charmed and privileged life. But adversity builds character, and to be   honest, it wasn't all Susan's fault, or Frank Bellarosa's fault, or the fault of   the IRS, or my stuffed-shirt law partners; it was partly my own fault because I,   too, was involved with Frank Bellarosa. A little legal work. Like representing   him on a murder charge. Not the kind of thing I normally did as a Wall Street   lawyer, and certainly not the kind of case that Perkins, Perkins, Sutter and   Reynolds would approve of. Therefore, I'd handled this case out of my Locust   Valley, Long Island, office, but that wasn't much cover when the newspapers got   hold of it.  <p>  Thinking back on this, I couldn't help but know I was committing professional   and social suicide when I took a Mafia don as a client. But it was a challenge,   and I was bored, and Susan, who approved of and encouraged my association with   Frank Bellarosa, said I needed a challenge. I guess Susan was bored, too, and as   I found out, she had her own agenda regarding Frank Bellarosa.  <p>  And speaking of Susan, I had discovered through my son, Edward, that, quote,   "Mom has bought our house back."  <p>  Bad grammar aside-I sent this kid to great schools-what Edward meant was that   Susan had reacquired the large guest cottage on the Stanhope estate. This   so-called cottage-it has six bedrooms-had been our marital residence for nearly   twenty years, and is located about a quarter mile up the main drive of the   estate. In other words, Susan and I were now neighbors.  <p>  The guest cottage and ten acres of property had been carved out of the two   hundred sixty acres of the Stanhope estate by Susan's father, William, who's an   insufferable prick, and deeded to Susan as a wedding gift. Since I was the   groom, I always wondered why my name wasn't on the deed. But you need to   understand old money to answer that. You also need to understand pricks like   William. Not to mention his ditsy wife, Susan's mother, Charlotte. These two   characters are unfortunately still alive and well, living and golfing in Hilton   Head, South Carolina, where Susan had been living since the unfortunate gun   mishap that took her lover's life ten years ago.  <p>  Before Susan left for South Carolina, she'd sold the guest cottage to a yuppie   corporate transfer couple from someplace west of the Hudson. You know your   marriage is in trouble when your wife sells the house and moves to another   state. In truth, however, it was I who ended the marriage. Susan wanted us to   stay together, making the obvious point that her lover was dead, and thus we   needn't worry about bumping into him at a party. In fact, she claimed that was   why she'd killed him; so we could be together.  <p>  That wasn't quite it, but it sounded nice. In retrospect, we probably could have   stayed together, but I was too angry at being cuckolded, and my male ego had   taken a major hit. I mean, not only did our friends, family, and children know   that Susan was fucking a Mafia don, but the whole damned country knew when it   hit the tabloids&#58; "Dead Don Diddled Lawyer's Heiress Wife." Or something like   that.  <p>  It may have worked out for us if, as Susan had suggested, I'd killed her lover   myself. But I wouldn't have gotten off as easily as she had. Even if I'd somehow   beaten the murder rap-crime of passion-I'd have some explaining to do to don   Bellarosa's friends and family.  <p>  So she sold the house, leaving me homeless, except, of course, for the Yale Club   in Manhattan, where I am always welcome. But Susan, in a rare display of   thoughtfulness, suggested to me that Ethel Allard, recently widowed, could use   some company in the gatehouse. That actually wasn't a bad idea, and since Ethel   could also use a few bucks in rent, and a handyman to replace her recently   deceased husband, I'd moved into the extra bedroom and stored my belongings in   the basement, where they'd sat for this past decade.  <p>  By spring of the following year, I'd made a financial settlement with my   partners and used the money to buy the forty-six-foot Morgan, which I christened   <i>Paumanok II</i>. By that time, my membership in the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club   had been terminated by mutual consent, so I sailed from the public marina where   I'd bought the boat and began my three-year odyssey at sea.  <p>  Odysseus was trying to get home; I was trying to get away from home. Odysseus   wanted to see his wife; maybe I did, too, but it didn't happen. I'd told Susan I   would put in at Hilton Head, and I almost did, but within sight of land, I   headed back to sea with just a glance over my shoulder. Clean break. No regrets.  <p>  I threw the nude photos of Susan on the table, instead of in the fireplace.   Maybe she wanted them.  <p>  I poured more cognac into the dregs of the coffee and took a swallow.  <p>  I looked up at a large, ornately framed, hand-colored photo portrait of Ethel   and George Allard, which hung over the mantel.  <p>  It was a wedding picture, taken during World War II, and George is dressed in   his Navy whites, and Ethel is wearing a white wedding dress of the period. Ethel   was quite a looker in her day, and I could see how Susan's grandfather,   Augustus, who was then lord of Stanhope Hall, could cross the class line and   fiddle with one of his female servants. It was inexcusable, of course, on every   level, especially since George, a Stanhope employee, was off to war, protecting   America from the Yellow Peril in the Pacific. But, as I found out as a young man   during the Vietnam War, and as I'm discovering with this new war, war tears   apart the social fabric of a nation, and you get a lot more diddling and   fiddling going on.  <p>  I stared at Ethel's angelic face in the photograph. She really was beautiful.   And lonely. And George was out of town for a while. And Augustus was rich and   powerful. He was not, however, according to family accounts, a conniving and   controlling prick like his son, my ex-father-in-law, William. I think Augustus   was just horny (it runs in the Stanhope family), and if you look at a picture of   Augustus' wife, Susan's grandmother, you can see why Augustus strayed. Susan, I   guess, got her good looks from her mother, Charlotte, who is still attractive,   though brainless.  <p>  And on the subject of brains and beauty, my children have both, and show no   signs of the Stanhope tendency to be off their rockers. I'd like to say my   children take after my side of the family, but my parents aren't good examples   of mental health either. I think I was adopted. I hope and pray I was.  <p>  Actually, my father, Joseph, passed away while I was at sea, and I missed the   funeral. Mother hasn't forgiven me. But that's nothing new.  <p>  And on the subject of children, paternity, and genetics, Ethel and George had   one child, a daughter, Elizabeth, who's a nice woman and who lives in the area.   Elizabeth gets her beauty from her mother, but looks enough like George to put   my mind at ease about any more Stanhope heirs.  <p>  I'm taking the long view of this in terms of my children inheriting some of the   Stanhope fortune. They deserve some money for putting up with Grandma and   Grandpa all their lives. So do I, but a probate court might find my claim on the   Stanhope estate-to reimburse me for years of putting up with William's   bullshit-to be frivolous.  <p>  In any case, there is a history here-my own family goes back three hundred years   on Long Island-and this history is entwined like the English ivy that covers the   gatehouse and the guest cottage; interesting to look at from a distance, but   obscuring the form and substance of the structure, eventually eating into the   brick and mortar.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><br> Excerpted from <b>The Gate Houseby</b> by <b>Nelson DeMille </b>  Copyright &copy; 2008   by Nelson DeMille.
