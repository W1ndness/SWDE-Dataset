Since Tania's mysterious disappearance five hundred years before, Faerie has been sunk in darkness and gloom. With her return, Faerie comes alive again as a land of winged children, glittering balls, and fantastic delights. But Tania can't forget Anita's world, or the boy she loved there. </p> <p> Torn between two loves and between two worlds, Tania slowly remembers why she disappeared, and realizes that she is the only one who can stop a sinister plan that threatens the entire world of Faerie. </p>
</p><h3>Children's Literature</h3><p>On the surface, <I>The Faerie Path</I> is as light and frothy as a latte&#151;smooth, sweet, and an indulgence for the senses. But as the plot unfolds, depths and unexpected twists take a simple fairy tale and turn it into a story of court intrigue, manipulation, and what it really means to belong somewhere. Anita considers herself a perfectly ordinary sixteen-year-old&#151;she loves school, acting, and spending time with her boyfriend, Evan. But when she gets into a boating accident and ends up in the hospital, strange things begin to happen to her. Her back starts to itch, she dreams she sprouts wings and flies over London, and she receives a mysterious book telling about the destiny of a faerie princess named Tania. Then a mysterious young man visits her in the hospital and magically transports Anita to the world of Faerie, where she discovers she is the long-lost princess Tania. Tania's destiny is to restore Faerie to the glory it had many years earlier. Skeptical at first, Anita slowly comes to love Faerie, and begins to accept her role as Tania. She becomes friends with her long-lost sister, Rathina, and is courted by the handsome and mysterious Gabriel. But all is not well in Faerie. Anita discovers that Faerie is fading and losing magic, and uncovers a plot to overthrow the king. Then she discovers a magical ability to transport herself between the world of Faerie and London, and begins to see disturbing images of Faerie in despair in her transition. And a man who reminds her of Evan warns Anita she may be in danger. It is up to Anita, armed with clues from a prophetic riddle and her unique talents and abilities, to uncover the traitorous plot against the king and save Faerie.

											This whole series is very good.  Once you pick one of them up and start reading it, you never want to stop.  It has a very original, fun storyline.  It has everything you could possibly want in a book; mystery, romance, intrigue, betrayal, magic, and a certain evil character planning to thwart the fairy king, Oberon, who is also Tania's father.  This book is one of my absolute favorites; I have read it more times than I can count.  Bottom line, get it; you won't regret it.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Truth-about-Forever/Sarah-Dessen/e/9780142406250/?pv=y">The Truth about Forever</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/My-Fair-Godmother/Janette-Rallison/e/9780802720733/?pv=y">My Fair Godmother</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/JUST-ONE-WISH/JANETTE-RALLISON/e/9781616790271/?pv=y">Just One Wish</a>. </p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P> Swept away into a court of magic and beauty, she discovers she is Tania, the lost princess of Faerie.

</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>Anita falls for the new boy, Evan, playing Juliet opposite his Romeo in the school play. But while speed boating on the Thames the day before her sixteenth birthday, they crash and land in the hospital. That night, Anita imagines sprouting wings and flying over London, and then over another land she vaguely recognizes. The next night, she is summoned by an apparition into another world. She assumes that it is all a dream but learns that she is Tania, seventh daughter of King Oberon of Faerie, prophesied to have the unique ability to move between the mortal and faerie worlds. She disappeared five hundred years ago on the eve of her wedding to Lord Gabriel. Finally she has been found and returned, albeit with no memory of her life in Faerie. Evan is actually Gabriel's servant charged with the job of bringing her home. Tania gets to know her sisters, her fiancT, and her world, all while trying to deal with Evan's deceit and find a way to return to reassure her parents in the mortal world. Despite a predictable plot, Tania's jarringly modern speech, and her unlikely gullibility in trusting her enemies, the book is appealing. The images are vivid, the characters are charming, and Tania learns to make her own decisions. She grows enough to rescue her true love and find her own destiny, despite evil adversaries who profess to be her friends. This first book in a new series is entertaining fare for younger fantasy fans.
</p><h3>KLIATT</h3><p>AGERANGE: Ages 12 to 18. <p>To quote the review of the hardcover in KLIATT, January 2007: London teen Anita Palmer, on the brink of her 16th birthday, seems as if she has it all: loving parents, the lead in the school production of <I>Romeo and Juliet,</I> and the cute and mysterious new boy, Evan Thomas, for a boyfriend. But things turn out very differently when Anita crosses the border between the Mortal World and the Faerie World. There she learns that she is the long-lost Princess Tania, seventh and youngest daughter of Oberon and Titania, the King and Queen of Faerie. She is expected to pick up her life where she left off when she vanished--500 years previously. Oberon has kept the land in a perpetual twilight that prevented time from passing. As beautiful and wonderful as Faerie is, Anita--now Tania--is still worried about the parents who raised her in the Mortal World. She also misses her life there, and she�s not completely prepared to give it up. She learns that she has a talent for moving between the Worlds, and as she gains control of her power, she suspects that someone might be plotting to exploit her talent, and not in a good way. Although the beginning is a bit slow, the pace picks up once Anita enters Faerie. The contrast between her modern demeanor and speech and the more archaic ones of Faerie is amusing and not overdone; the reader gets the impression that she will never quite get the knack of being a Faerie Princess. If the plot and characters are at time transparent--readers will figure out who the bad guys are--Jones introduces some original fresh ideas, such as the dreaded Amber Prison, which freezes a person in an amber ball indefinitely, able to see everythingaround him but not to sleep. He also ties up the obvious question of how Tania survived 500 years in the Mortal World and lays the groundwork for a sequel, one which no doubt will be eagerly anticipated.

She learns that she has a talent for moving between the Worlds, and as she gains control of her power, she suspects that someone might be plotting to exploit her talent, and not in a good way. Although the beginning is a bit slow, the pace picks up once Anita enters Faerie. The contrast between her modern demeanor and speech and the more archaic ones of Faerie is amusing and not overdone; the reader gets the impression that she will never quite get the knack of being a Faerie Princess. If the plot and characters are at time transparent&#151;readers will figure out who the bad guys are&#151;Jones introduces some original fresh ideas, such as the dreaded Amber Prison, which freezes a person in an amber ball indefinitely, able to see everything around him but not to sleep. He also ties up the obvious question ofhow Tania survived 500 years in the Mortal World and lays the groundwork for a sequel, one which no doubt will be eagerly anticipated.

								School Library Journal</h3><p><P>Gr 6 Up<br>On the day before her 16th birthday, Anita's life starts to change. She has a vision of flying, receives a mysterious and magical book as a present, and travels from modern-day London to the world of Faerie. She discovers that her boyfriend, Evan, is really Edric, servant of the scheming faerie lord Gabriel Drake, and that he has been sent to bring her home. Anita is really Princess Tania, the seventh and youngest daughter of King Oberon, and she has been lost for centuries after experimenting with her power to travel between worlds. Anita/Tania comes to accept her true identity and the joy she has brought to her father and his realm. However, all is not well in Faerie. Queen Titania has disappeared, and Gabriel Drake is somehow involved with her loss. He claims to love Tania and wants to marry her, but is actually interested only in her magical power. While the conclusion resolves Tania's immediate problems, there is ample room for a sequel. This fairy tale meets "Princess Diaries" clearly shows Anita/Tania's confusion about her identity. She is a strong character, and her sisters and their varied powers and personalities are also well drawn. The teens' romance, foreshadowed by their starring roles in their school's production of <I>Romeo and Juliet</I> in this world, develops as the story progresses, and frequent quotes from and allusions to the play add depth to the story.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>All little girls with even an ounce of imagination have wondered what it would be like to have wings and be magical. Anita Palmer gets to find out, up close and personal. She is mysteriously transported out of modern day London into the world of Faerie, only to find out that she is herself the long lost seventh daughter of the fabled king Oberon himself. Unfortunately, not everything is gossamer wings (losing them is a rite of passage for younger faeries) and magical tapestries. Getting to know and love her new family doesn't stop her from missing her old earth-bound parents. And while her escort in Faerie appears both handsome and caring, she just can't make herself comfortable with the idea of romance and eventual marriage to Lord Drake. Can she really trust him? In a well-paced style that will communicate with today's readers, Jones relates well the emotional turmoil that all adolescents experience, be they faerie or human. The ending cleanly sets up a potential sequel for further adventures in the near future. (Fiction. 12+)

Wrapping it around herself, she padded over to the mirror. She lifted her hand and swept a clear path across the misted glass before leaning forward to look at her reflection. </p>  <p> Her long red hair clung to her head like seaweed to a rock, framing her heart-shaped face with its wide mouth and high cheekbones. She leaned closer, staring into her mirrored eyes. The irises were a smoky green. Nothing particularly remarkable about them. </p>  <p> Or was there? </p>  <p> She leaned even closer. </p>  <p> Gold flecks deep in the green irises&#8212;that was what she was looking for. </p>  <p> Evan had said that if he looked into her eyes for long enough, he could see gold dust in them. </p>  <p> Anita grinned. </p>  <p> <i>Gold dust in her eyes.</i> </p>  <p> Sometimes when she was with Evan she could almost believe she had gold dust in her eyes. </p>  <p> She frowned. </p>  <p> It was quite scary&#8212;the feelings that Evan Thomas was stirring up in her. </p>  <p> Were they real? They felt real enough. Over the past few weeks thinking about Evan had somehow become the default setting of her brain. And she kept seeing his face&#8212;in the swirls of a freshly stirred cup of coffee. In shadows and light. In clouds. In the darkness behind her closed eyelids. </p>  <p> She recalled lines from the play they had been rehearsing for the end-of-term performance. Shakespeare. <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. </p>  <p> She could hear Evan's voice in her head. </p>  <p> <i>"But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is my sun!"</i> </p>  <p>She'd said to him, "That's not right, Evan. Romeo says, '<i>and Juliet is</i> the <i>sun</i>' not '<i>my</i> sun.'" </p>  <p> He'd smiled and said, "No&#8212;you're Juliet, and you're definitely <i>my</i> sun." </p>  <p> And the way he had looked into her eyes right then had made her feel like the whole world was turning upside down and inside out all around her. </p>  <p> She laughed into the mirror, shaking her head to dislodge the memory. Still grinning, she threw the towel up over her head and rubbed vigorously at her wet hair. She didn't want to be late meeting Evan today&#8212;<i>especially</i> not today. </p>  <p> She winced as the towel scraped against the two itchy points on her back. She lowered the towel and angled her bare back to the mirror, craning to see over her shoulder. Something had bitten her. Twice. There was an angry red point on each shoulder blade. They had been there for a few days now. Very irritating, and in such an awkward place to scratch. She'd have to wear something that covered her back&#8212;the last thing she wanted was for Evan to think she was crawling with fleas. </p>  <p> She looked into the mirror again. </p>  <p> Did she really love Evan, or was she just getting tangled up in the fact that she had to <i>act</i> as if she loved him in the play? No, she was sure that it was much more than that. She had felt a strange, thrilling flutter in her stomach when she had been chosen to play Juliet opposite his Romeo, and over the weeks of rehearsals, as she had gotten to know him better, that thrill had just kept getting more and more intense. </p>  <p> She thought back to the auditions. Everyone had been surprised that Evan had shown up at all. He had only been at the school for six months, and he had always seemed so reserved and self-contained, not the type of person who'd want a major part in the school production. He was amiable enough in class, but he hadn't made any close friends and the other students mostly thought of him as something of a loner. No one had ever been invited to his home, and he didn't hang out with them on weekends or go to any parties. </p>  <p> Anita could remember exactly when Evan had first turned up. It had been on the same day as the school trip to Hampton Court. </p>  <p> It had been a weird day. She knew it was called d&#233;j&#224; vu when you have vivid memories of a place you've never been to, and that's how she had felt from the moment the bus had driven up to the parking lot and she had first set eyes on the sixteenth-century palace at Hampton Court&#8212;the feeling that she'd been there before. The sturdy red-brick Tudor towers and buildings with their cream-colored stone battlements and ornamentations, and the cobbled courtyards and wide, formal gardens&#8212;they had all seemed strangely familiar. But when she mentioned this later to her parents, assuming she'd visited the palace when she was much younger, they said they'd never taken her there. </p>  <p> The strangest thing of all had been the world-famous maze. It was a large triangular block of tall hedges, grown close together to create a warren of narrow winding corridors. Pretty much every visitor to the palace wanted to put their sense of direction to the test and find their way to the center. Everyone from the school bus had bundled in there, the boys boasting that they'd get to the middle first. It had been total chaos&#8212;most of them got hopelessly lost and had to be guided through by the people shouting from the wooden viewing platforms. </p>  <p> At first Anita had hung back. The green tunnels of the hedges had given her a creepy feeling that she couldn't explain. But then her best friend, Jade, had grabbed her arm and dragged her in&#8212;and once she was in the maze, the oddest thing had happened. Somehow she had known the path, and made her way to the little statue in the center without taking a single wrong turn. "How about that?" she'd said to Jade, laughing. "Am I a genius, or what?" But Jade had said it was just luck. </p>  <p> That same afternoon, she had seen him for the first time. The most gorgeous boy she had ever set eyes on in her entire life, standing outside the school gates when the bus pulled up. Evan Thomas&#8212;a new student who had just moved into the area. </p>   <I><b>The Faerie Path</b></I>. Copyright � by Frewin Jones. Reprinted by  permission of HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.
