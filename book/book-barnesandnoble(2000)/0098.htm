											My what can i say about this book?It is a very interesting Book,I had been waiting for it to come out,i had read about it and as soon as it hit the store i bought it and finished it A.S.A.P!It is a very sad story and i learned alot about Cell's,For it being her first book Rebecca Skloot did a wonderful tribute to Henrietta Lacks And the way she wrote it is just a good read,I hope she write's more book's in the future,I wish her Family could get some type of compensation from these Cell's and if only maybe they could get a Pro-Bono lawyer to help them i think that is all they were wanting was legal help,Maybe it's to late,I am glad to see her family is growing and maybe they will be noticed.Either way i enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to anyone!</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Great book for those who love science<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=SaxophoneReader">SaxophoneReader</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1404435_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781400052172_BK_2_1404435" href="#previewReview_1404435" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 13, 2010: 
											Personally, I loved this book.  It might be hard for some people to understand, if they don't understand much about biology and cell science.  For me, since I'm taking a biology honors class, this book was great.  It combined an interesting plot line with my favorite subject ever, science.  It's not action-packed or suspencful, but it is a good book to read in your spare time. <p/> The book is not only about the life of Henrietta Lacks, but her immortal cells, that changed science forever.  I'll try not to give away to much, but her cells helped in the study or cancer cells, viruses, and devloping the polio vaccine.  The book really touched me, and made me realize how much we all owe Henrietta Lacks.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</h3><p><p><strong>Henrietta Lacks</strong> lives a shadowy life as a footnote in biology textbooks. I first encountered her when taking a college course in cell biology: the cells used in a particular experiment, we learned, were "HeLa cells," which, though human, can grow independently outside the body in specially created laboratory conditions. They were named for the woman, Helen Lane, from whom they were originally derived. And that was all; having explained this, my professor returned to discussing the experiment and its significance. Like a drowned corpse bobbing up from the dark depths of footnote-dom, Helen Lane had surfaced briefly, only to descend again into obscurity. I didn't give her a second thought.</p><p>In contrast, science writer Rebecca Skloot also had a Helen Lane footnote moment in high school, but saw in that footnote the nucleus of a story about science and society. After ten years of HeLa sleuthing, Skloot's hunch has paid off handsomely: <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> is a modern classic of science writing.</p><p>Let me qualify that. This isn't science writing in the sense of Stephen Jay Gould or Richard Dawkins: Skloot doesn't spend a lot of time describing or extolling scientific discoveries. For her, the science is a bit player -- though an important one -- in a complex and fascinating drama about how medical research intersected the lives of a poor black family in America. Her mixture of science and biography is <em>sui generis</em>, and its themes profound: racism, ethics, and scientific illiteracy.</p><p>The first thing Skloot learned was that "Helen Lane" was not the woman's real name, but a journalist's pseudonym for Henrietta Lacks. Born in1920 to a poor tobacco-farming family from southern Virginia, Lacks married and, following her husband's job, moved to Maryland. At age 31, she presented herself at Johns Hopkins Hospital, complaining of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Doctors found an evil-looking purple growth on her cervix, which turned out to be malignant. She was given the latest treatment -- a packet of radium sewn inside her vagina -- but it didn't work. Eight months later Lacks died in agony, leaving five young children.</p><p>But for a quirk of fate, Lacks would be just another working person who lived and died in obscurity. A slice of her biopsy fell into the hands of George Gey, a researcher at Hopkins who, with the help of his wife Mary, had spent fruitless years trying to keep human cells alive in the laboratory. (This "tissue culture" is crucial for medical research since it obviates the need to experiment on living patients.) For some reason Helen's cells, which Gey dubbed "HeLa," not only lived, but divided rapaciously, becoming the first human cells that could be cultured indefinitely in the lab. We now know why: Lacks's cells have elevated amounts of an enzyme that keeps them from ageing.</p><p><strong>Convinced</strong> that HeLa cells were the key to curing cancer, Gey handed them out gratis to dozens of researchers. And they became a scientific gold mine, used to develop the first polio vaccines, test chemotherapy drugs like Taxol, find treatments for AIDS, work out techniques for <em>in vitro</em> fertilization, and map genes onto human chromosomes. Even now, after nearly sixty years, 14 scientific papers on HeLa cells are published <em>every day</em>. Clearly, Henrietta Lacks achieved both physical and scientific immortality.</p><p>But her family was unaware of her distinction, and although biotechnology companies made millions of dollars peddling HeLa cells, her children never saw a dime. In fact, they didn't even know about the famous cells until years after Henrietta's death, finding out only when her daughter-in-law, who learned about them by accident, called the family with a chilling message: "Part of your mother, it's alive!"&nbsp; The commercial exploitation of Lacks's cells made her kin feel exploited and resentful. It took Skloot a year to get the family to return her phone calls, several more before they opened up completely. Eventually Skloot became friend and confidante to Henrietta's daughter Deborah, who was only an infant when her mother died. Deborah's search for the mother she never knew, and for the significance of her still-growing cells, is the pivot on which Skloot's story turns.</p><p>As Skloot led her through the maze of science, Deborah became deeply ambivalent. On one hand she was proud of her mother's contributions to medicine, on the other she became paranoid and erratic, worried that she would catch her mother's cancer or be pursued by the same doctors who, she believed, killed Henrietta. The tumultuous friendship between author and subject makes for some amazing vignettes: Deborah seeing her mother's cells for the first time under a microscope ("Oh God," she gasped. "I can't believe all that's my mother"); Deborah worrying that the experimental fusion of HeLa cells with plant cells would produce a "human monster that was half her mother, half tobacco"; Deborah being exorcised of the demon cells by her evangelical cousin Gary as Skloot looks on ("LORD, I KNOW you sent Miss Rebecca to help LIFT THE BURDEN of them CELLS!").</p><p>The family finally makes peace with HeLa, deciding that "God chose Henrietta as an angel who would be reborn as immortal cells." Despite this, Skloot's tale doesn't end happily. But I defy you to read it without being moved. Or without <em>thinking</em>, for beneath the book runs a subliminal conversation about medical ethics. Apart from the selfless George Gey, Skloot's scientists and doctors behaved less than honorably. Henrietta Lacks's cells were cultured, disseminated, and sold without her or the family's knowledge or consent. Doctors with more curiosity than morality injected the cells into unsuspecting patients to see if they could cause cancer. The aggressive growth of HeLa cells caused them to contaminate other human cell cultures throughout the world, but scientists refused to admit the problem lest they lose reputation and funding. And, to track down this contamination, scientists at Johns Hopkins requested blood samples from Deborah and her siblings, but misled them by saying they were being "tested for cancer." Skloot avoids moralizing, but the injustice done to the Lacks family is palpable. One of many reasons to buy this wonderful book is to redress that injury: part of the profits go to a scholarship fund for Henrietta Lacks's descendants.</p><p>Skloot's afterword describes the current state of medical ethics. Sadly, progress has been slow. Yes, patients' names and records are now private, and scientists can't experiment on living subjects without informed consent, but doctors can still remove, profit from, and even patent a patient's tissues and DNA without her permission. This has become increasingly worrisome in the modern age of genomics. Since anyone's DNA might harbor a gene that is medically or commercially useful, all of us are fertile ground for genetic prospecting. That's not inherently bad, but researchers should remember the first dictum of medical ethics: patients are fellow human beings, not just collections of genes and tissues. Skloot describes how that insight struck George Gey's assistant when she saw Henrietta Lacks, nails carefully tended, laid out on the autopsy table:</p><blockquote>"When I saw those toenails," Mary told me years later, "I nearly fainted. I thought, <em>Oh geez, she's a real person</em>. I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we'd been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I'd never thought of it that way."</blockquote><br><p>  <i>--Jerry Coyne</i></p><br>
</p><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers</b><br>Longtime Discover fans may recall the name Floyd Skloot from years past. Floyd, an acclaimed poet and memoirist, was a finalist for the Discover Award in 2003. Well the apple doesn�t fall far from the tree. His daughter�s debut, an intriguing book about the harvesting of DNA from an unsuspecting woman, is a marvel.<p> Rebecca Skloot first learned about HeLa cells more than a decade ago, while enrolled at community college. Named after Henrietta Lacks, a poor African-American woman born in 1920, the famed cells were taken from a tumor removed during Lacks�s treatment for cervical cancer. While she died from the disease, her cancer cells proved uncommonly hearty, reproducing at an unheard-of rate, and years later, billions of these cells are used in laboratories around the world. <p> The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a story about science � and so much more. Lacks died unaware that doctors would be using her cells to further advances in the scientific community � and cashing in on such developments � and never received a dime. In search of justice, Skloot seeks out Lacks�s descendants to learn if they�re aware of the famed cells and to see if they�ve derived any benefit from the important contribution to science their relative made. A fascinating discussion of the enduring legal and ethical questions that human-tissue  research raises, Skloot�s debut is a gem.
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells&mdash;taken without her knowledge&mdash;became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first &ldquo;immortal&rdquo; human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they&rsquo;d weigh more than 50 million metric tons&mdash;as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb&rsquo;s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. <P>Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.<P>Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the &ldquo;colored&rdquo; ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta&rsquo;s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia&mdash;a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo&mdash;to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. <P>Henrietta&rsquo;s family did not learn of her &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any ofthe profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family&mdash;past and present&mdash;is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. <P>Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family&mdash;especially Henrietta&rsquo;s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother&rsquo;s cells. She was consumed with questions&#58; Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn&rsquo;t her children afford health insurance?&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.
</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Dwight Garner</h3><p>&#8230;one of the most graceful and moving nonfiction books I've read in a very long time. A thorny and provocative book about cancer, racism, scientific ethics and crippling poverty, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> also floods over you like a narrative dam break, as if someone had managed to distill and purify the more addictive qualities of "Erin Brockovich," <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i> and <i>The Andromeda Strain.</i> More than 10 years in the making, it feels like the book Ms. Skloot was born to write. It signals the arrival of a raw but quite real talent&#8230;[<i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i>] has brains and pacing and nerve and heart, and it is uncommonly endearing.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Eric Roston</h3><p>Skloot's vivid account&#8230;reads like a novel. The prose is unadorned, crisp and transparent&#8230;This book, labeled "science--cultural studies," should be treated as a work of American history. It's a deftly crafted investigation of a social wrong committed by the medical establishment, as well as the scientific and medical miracles to which it led. Skloot's compassionate account can be the first step toward recognition, justice and healing.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Science journalist Skloot makes a remarkable debut with this multilayered story about &ldquo;faith, science, journalism, and grace.&rdquo; It is also a tale of medical wonders and medical arrogance, racism, poverty and the bond that grows, sometimes painfully, between two very different women&mdash;Skloot and Deborah Lacks&mdash;sharing an obsession to learn about Deborah&rsquo;s mother, Henrietta, and her magical, immortal cells. Henrietta Lacks was a 31-year-old black mother of five in Baltimore when she died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, doctors treating her at Johns Hopkins took tissue samples from her cervix for research. They spawned the first viable, indeed miraculously productive, cell line&mdash;known as HeLa. These cells have aided in medical discoveries from the polio vaccine to AIDS treatments. What Skloot so poignantly portrays is the devastating impact Henrietta&rsquo;s death and the eventual importance of her cells had on her husband and children. Skloot&rsquo;s portraits of Deborah, her father and brothers are so vibrant and immediate they recall Adrian Nicole LeBlanc&rsquo;s Random Family. Writing in plain, clear prose, Skloot avoids melodrama and makes no judgments. Letting people and events speak for themselves, Skloot tells a rich, resonant tale of modern science, the wonders it can perform and how easily it can exploit society&rsquo;s most vulnerable people. (Feb.)
</p><h3>Booklist</h3><p>Writing with a novelist's artistry, a biologist's expertise, and the zeal of an investigative reporter, Skloot tells a truly astonishing story of racism and poverty, science and conscience, spirituality and family driven by a galvanizing inquiry into the sanctity of the body and the very nature of the life force.  Starred review.<br>
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>This distinctive work skillfully puts a human face on the bioethical questions surrounding the HeLa cell line. Henrietta Lacks, an African American mother of five, was undergoing treatment for cancer at Johns Hopkins University in 1951 when tissue samples were removed without her knowledge or permission and used to create HeLa, the first "immortal" cell line. HeLa has been sold around the world and used in countless medical research applications, including the development of the polio vaccine. Science writer Skloot, who worked on this book for ten years, entwines Lacks's biography, the development of the HeLa cell line, and her own story of building a relationship with Lacks's children. Full of dialog and vivid detail, this reads like a novel, but the science behind the story is also deftly handled. VERDICT While there are other titles on this controversy (e.g., Michael Gold's A Conspiracy of Cells&#58; One Woman's Immortal Legacy&mdash;and the Medical Scandal It Caused), this is the most compelling account for general readers, especially those interested in questions of medical research ethics. Highly recommended. [See Skloot's essay, p. 126; Prepub Alert, LJ 11/1/09.]&mdash;Carla Lee, Univ. of Virginia Lib., Charlottesville
</p><h3>The New York Times Book Review - 
								Lisa Margonelli</h3><p>&#8230;Rebecca Skloot introduces us to the "real live woman," the children who survived her, and the interplay of race, poverty, science and one of the most important medical discoveries of the last 100 years. Skloot narrates the science lucidly, tracks the racial politics of medicine thoughtfully and tells the Lacks family's often painful history with grace. She also confronts the spookiness of the cells themselves, intrepidly crossing into the spiritual plane on which the family has come to understand their mother's continued presence in the world. Science writing is often just about "the facts." Skloot's book, her first, is far deeper, braver and more wonderful.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A dense, absorbing investigation into the medical community's exploitation of a dying woman and her family's struggle to salvage truth and dignity decades later. In a well-paced, vibrant narrative, Popular Science contributor and Culture Dish blogger Skloot (Creative Writing/Univ. of Memphis) demonstrates that for every human cell put under a microscope, a complex life story is inexorably attached, to which doctors, researchers and laboratories have often been woefully insensitive and unaccountable. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks, an African-American mother of five, was diagnosed with what proved to be a fatal form of cervical cancer. At Johns Hopkins, the doctors harvested cells from her cervix without her permission and distributed them to labs around the globe, where they were multiplied and used for a diverse array of treatments. Known as HeLa cells, they became one of the world's most ubiquitous sources for medical research of everything from hormones, steroids and vitamins to gene mapping, in vitro fertilization, even the polio vaccine-all without the knowledge, must less consent, of the Lacks family. Skloot spent a decade interviewing every relative of Lacks she could find, excavating difficult memories and long-simmering outrage that had lay dormant since their loved one's sorrowful demise. Equal parts intimate biography and brutal clinical reportage, Skloot's graceful narrative adeptly navigates the wrenching Lack family recollections and the sobering, overarching realities of poverty and pre-civil-rights racism. The author's style is matched by a methodical scientific rigor and manifest expertise in the field. Skloot's meticulous, riveting account strikes a humanistic balance betweensociological history, venerable portraiture and Petri dish politics. Tie-in with multicity author lecture schedule.

</p><h3>What People Are Saying</h3><p><strong>Susan Orlean</strong><br>"Skloot's book is wonderful -- deeply felt, gracefully written, sharply reported. It is a story about science but, much more, about life."--(Susan Orlean, author of The Orchid Thief)
</p><br><p><strong>Ted Conover</strong><br>"No one can say exactly where Henrietta Lacks is buried: during the many years Rebecca Skloot spent working on this book, even Lacks's hometown of Clover, Virginia, disappeared. But that did not stop Skloot in her quest to exhume, and resurrect, the story of her heroine and her family. What this important, invigorating book lays bare is how easily science can do wrong, especially to the poor. The issues evoked here are giant: who owns our bodies, the use and misuse of medical authority, the unhealed wounds of slavery ... and Skloot, with clarity and compassion, helps us take the long view. This is exactly the sort of story that books were made to tell-thorough, detailed, quietly passionate, and full of revelation."--(Ted Conover, author of Newjack and The Routes of Man)
</p><br><p><strong>Eric Schlosser</strong><br>"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks brings to mind the work of Philip K. Dick and Edgar Allan Poe. But this tale is true. Rebecca Skloot explores the racism and greed, the idealism and faith in science that helped to save thousands of lives but nearly destroyed a family. This is an extraordinary book, haunting and beautifully told."--(Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation)
</p><br><p><strong>Adrian Nicole LeBlanc</strong><br>"It's extremely rare when a reporter's passion finds its match in a story. Rarer still when the people in that story courageously join that reporter in the search for what we most need to know about ourselves. When this occurs with a moral journalist who is also a true writer, a human being with a heart capable of holding all of life's damage and joy, the stars have aligned. This is an extraordinary gift of a book, beautiful and devastating-a work of outstanding literary reportage. Read it! It's the best you will find in many many years."--(Adrian Nicole LeBlanc, author of Random Family)

</div><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P><b>PROLOGUE</b><br>The Woman in the Photograph<P>There&rsquo;s a photo on my wall of a woman I&rsquo;ve never met, its left corner torn and patched together with tape. She looks straight into the camera and smiles, hands on hips, dress suit neatly pressed, lips painted deep red. It&rsquo;s the late 1940s and she hasn&rsquo;t yet reached the age of thirty. Her light brown skin is smooth, her eyes still young and playful, oblivious to the tumor growing inside her&mdash;a tumor that would leave her five children motherless and change the future of medicine. Beneath the photo, a caption says her name is &ldquo;Henrietta Lacks, Helen Lane or Helen Larson.&rdquo;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>No one knows who took that picture, but it&rsquo;s appeared hundreds of times in magazines and science textbooks, on blogs and laboratory walls. She&rsquo;s usually identified as Helen Lane, but often she has no name at all. She&rsquo;s simply called HeLa, the code name given to the world&rsquo;s first immortal human cells&mdash;<i>her </i>cells, cut from her cervix just months before she died.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Her real name is Henrietta Lacks.<P>I&rsquo;ve spent years staring at that photo, wondering what kind of life she led, what happened to her children, and what she&rsquo;d think about cells from her cervix living on forever&mdash;bought, sold, packaged, and shipped by the trillions to laboratories around the world. I&rsquo;ve tried to imagine how she&rsquo;d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helpedwith some of the most important advances in medicine&#58; the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that she&mdash;like most of us&mdash;would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>There&rsquo;s no way of knowing exactly how many of Henrietta&rsquo;s cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they&rsquo;d weigh more than 50 million metric tons&mdash;an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing. Another scientist calculated that if you could lay all HeLa cells ever grown end-to-end, they&rsquo;d wrap around the Earth at least three times, spanning more than 350 million feet. In her prime, Henrietta herself stood only a bit over five feet tall.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>I first learned about HeLa cells and the woman behind them in 1988, thirty-seven years after her death, when I was sixteen and sitting in a community college biology class. My instructor, Donald Defler, a gnomish balding man, paced at the front of the lecture hall and flipped on an overhead projector. He pointed to two diagrams that appeared on the wall behind him. They were schematics of the cell reproduction cycle, but to me they just looked like a neon-colored mess of arrows, squares, and circles with words I didn&rsquo;t understand, like &ldquo;MPF Triggering a Chain Reaction of Protein Activations.&rdquo;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;<br>I was a kid who&rsquo;d failed freshman year at the regular public high school because she never showed up. I&rsquo;d transferred to an alternative school that offered dream studies instead of biology, so I was taking Defler&rsquo;s class for high-school credit, which meant that I was sitting in a college lecture hall at sixteen with words like <i>mitosis </i>and <i>kinase inhibitors </i>flying around. I was completely lost.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;Do we have to memorize everything on those diagrams?&rdquo; one student yelled.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Yes, Defler said, we had to memorize the diagrams, and yes, they&rsquo;d be on the test, but that didn&rsquo;t matter right then. What he wanted us to understand was that cells are amazing things&#58; There are about one hundred trillion of them in our bodies, each so small that several thousand could fit on the period at the end of this sentence. They make up all our tissues&mdash;muscle, bone, blood&mdash;which in turn make up our organs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Under the microscope, a cell looks a lot like a fried egg&#58; It has a white (the <i>cytoplasm</i>) that&rsquo;s full of water and proteins to keep it fed, and a yolk (the <i>nucleus</i>) that holds all the genetic information that makes you <i>you. </i>The cytoplasm buzzes like a New York City street. It&rsquo;s crammed full of molecules and vessels endlessly shuttling enzymes and sugars from one part of the cell to another, pumping water, nutrients, and oxygen in and out of the cell. All the while, little cytoplasmic factories work 24/7, cranking out sugars, fats, proteins, and energy to keep the whole thing running and feed the nucleus. The nucleus is the brains of the operation; inside every nucleus within each cell in your body, there&rsquo;s an identical copy of your entire genome. That genome tells cells when to grow and divide and makes sure they do their jobs, whether that&rsquo;s controlling your heartbeat or helping your brain understand the words on this page.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Defler paced the front of the classroom telling us how mitosis&mdash;the process of cell division&mdash;makes it possible for embryos to grow into babies, and for our bodies to create new cells for healing wounds or replenishing blood we&rsquo;ve lost. It was beautiful, he said, like a perfectly choreographed dance.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>All it takes is one small mistake anywhere in the division process for cells to start growing out of control, he told us. Just <i>one </i>enzyme misfiring, just <i>one </i>wrong protein activation, and you could have cancer. Mitosis goes haywire, which is how it spreads.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;We learned that by studying cancer cells in culture,&rdquo; Defler said. He grinned and spun to face the board, where he wrote two words in enormous print&#58; HENRIETTA LACKS.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Henrietta died in 1951 from a vicious case of cervical cancer, he told us. But before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta&rsquo;s were different&#58; they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;Henrietta&rsquo;s cells have now been living outside her body far longer than they ever lived inside it,&rdquo; Defler said. If we went to almost any cell culture lab in the world and opened its freezers, he told us, we&rsquo;d probably find millions&mdash;if not billions&mdash;of Henrietta&rsquo;s cells in small vials on ice.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; and they&rsquo;ve been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers. Their chromosomes and proteins have been studied with such detail and precision that scientists know their every quirk. Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta&rsquo;s cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;HeLa cells were one of the most important things that happened to medicine in the last hundred years,&rdquo; Defler said.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Then, matter-of-factly, almost as an afterthought, he said, &ldquo;She was a black woman.&rdquo; He erased her name in one fast swipe and blew the chalk from his hands. Class was over.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>As the other students filed out of the room, I sat thinking, <i>That&rsquo;s it? That&rsquo;s all we get? There has to be more to the story.</i><br><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br></i>I followed Defler to his office.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;Where was she from?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Did she know how important her cells were? Did she have any children?&rdquo;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;I wish I could tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but no one knows anything about her.&rdquo;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>After class, I ran home and threw myself onto my bed with my biology textbook. I looked up &ldquo;cell culture&rdquo; in the index, and there she was, a small parenthetical&#58;<br>In culture, cancer cells can go on dividing indefinitely, if they have a continual supply of nutrients, and thus are said to be &ldquo;immortal.&rdquo; A striking example is a cell line that has been reproducing in culture since 1951. (Cells of this line are called HeLa cells because their original source was a tumor removed from a woman named Henrietta Lacks.)<P>That was it. I looked up HeLa in my parents&rsquo; encyclopedia, then my dictionary&#58; No Henrietta.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>As I graduated from high school and worked my way through college toward a biology degree, HeLa cells were omnipresent. I heard about them in histology, neurology, pathology; I used them in experiments on how neighboring cells communicate. But after Mr. Defler, no one mentioned Henrietta.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>When I got my first computer in the mid-nineties and started using the Internet, I searched for information about her, but found only confused snippets&#58; most sites said her name was Helen Lane; some said she died in the thirties; others said the forties, fifties, or even sixties. Some said ovarian cancer killed her, others said breast or cervical cancer.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>Eventually I tracked down a few magazine articles about her from the seventies. <i>Ebony </i>quoted Henrietta&rsquo;s husband saying, &ldquo;All I remember is that she had this disease, and right after she died they called me in the office wanting to get my permission to take a sample of some kind. I decided not to let them.&rdquo; <i>Jet </i>said the family was angry&mdash;angry that Henrietta&rsquo;s cells were being sold for twenty-five dollars a vial, and angry that articles had been published about the cells without their knowledge. It said, &ldquo;Pounding in the back of their heads was a gnawing feeling that science and the press had taken advantage of them.&rdquo;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>The articles all ran photos of Henrietta&rsquo;s family&#58; her oldest son sitting at his dining room table in Baltimore, looking at a genetics textbook. Her middle son in military uniform, smiling and holding a baby. But one picture stood out more than any other&#58; in it, Henrietta&rsquo;s daughter, Deborah Lacks, is surrounded by family, everyone smiling, arms around each other, eyes bright and excited. Except Deborah. She stands in the foreground looking alone, almost as if someone pasted her into the photo after the fact. She&rsquo;s twenty-six years old and beautiful, with short brown hair and catlike eyes. But those eyes glare at the camera, hard and serious. The caption said the family had found out just a few months earlier that Henrietta&rsquo;s cells were still alive, yet at that point she&rsquo;d been dead for twenty-five years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>All of the stories mentioned that scientists had begun doing research on Henrietta&rsquo;s children, but the Lackses didn&rsquo;t seem to know what that research was for. They said they were being tested to see if they had the cancer that killed Henrietta, but according to the reporters, scientists were studying the Lacks family to learn more about Henrietta&rsquo;s cells. The stories quoted her son Lawrence, who wanted to know if the immortality of his mother&rsquo;s cells meant that he might live forever too. But one member of the family remained voiceless&#58; Henrietta&rsquo;s daughter, Deborah.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>As I worked my way through graduate school studying writing, I became fixated on the idea of someday telling Henrietta&rsquo;s story. At one point I even called directory assistance in Baltimore looking for Henrietta&rsquo;s husband, David Lacks, but he wasn&rsquo;t listed. I had the idea that I&rsquo;d write a book that was a biography of both the cells and the woman they came from&mdash;someone&rsquo;s daughter, wife, and mother.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>I couldn&rsquo;t have imagined it then, but that phone call would mark the beginning of a decadelong adventure through scientific laboratories, hospitals, and mental institutions, with a cast of characters that would include Nobel laureates, grocery store clerks, convicted felons, and a professional con artist. While trying to make sense of the history of cell culture and the complicated ethical debate surrounding the use of human tissues in research, I&rsquo;d be accused of conspiracy and slammed into a wall both physically and metaphorically, and I&rsquo;d eventually find myself on the receiving end of something that looked a lot like an exorcism. I did eventually meet Deborah, who would turn out to be one of the strongest and most resilient women I&rsquo;d ever known. We&rsquo;d form a deep personal bond, and slowly, without realizing it, I&rsquo;d become a character in her story, and she in mine.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>Deborah and I came from very different cultures&#58; I grew up white and agnostic in the Pacific Northwest, my roots half New York Jew and half Midwestern Protestant; Deborah was a deeply religious black Christian from the South. I tended to leave the room when religion came up in conversation because it made me uncomfortable; Deborah&rsquo;s family tended toward preaching, faith healings, and sometimes voodoo. She grew up in a black neighborhood that was one of the poorest and most dangerous in the country; I grew up in a safe, quiet middle-class neighborhood in a predominantly white city and went to high school with a total of two black students. I was a science journalist who referred to all things supernatural as &ldquo;woo-woo stuff&rdquo;; Deborah believed Henrietta&rsquo;s spirit lived on in her cells, controlling the life of anyone who crossed its paths. Including me.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>&ldquo;How else do you explain why your science teacher knew her real name when everyone else called her Helen Lane?&rdquo; Deborah would say. &ldquo;She was trying to get your attention.&rdquo; This thinking would apply to everything in my life&#58; when I married while writing this book, it was because Henrietta wanted someone to take care of me while I worked. When I divorced, it was because she&rsquo;d decided he was getting in the way of the book. When an editor who insisted I take the Lacks family out of the book was injured in a mysterious accident, Deborah said that&rsquo;s what happens when you piss Henrietta off.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>The Lackses challenged everything I thought I knew about faith, science, journalism, and race. Ultimately, this book is the result. It&rsquo;s not only the story of HeLa cells and Henrietta Lacks, but of Henrietta&rsquo;s family&mdash;particularly Deborah&mdash;and their lifelong struggle to make peace with the existence of those cells, and the science that made them possible.

She looks straight into the camera and smiles, hands on hips, dress suit neatly pressed, lips painted deep red. It&rsquo;s the late 1940s and she hasn&rsquo;t yet reached the age of thirty. Her light brown skin is smooth, her eyes still young and playful, oblivious to the tumor growing inside her&mdash;a tumor that would leave her five children motherless and change the future of medicine. Beneath the photo, a caption says her name is &ldquo;Henrietta Lacks, Helen Lane or Helen Larson.&rdquo;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>No one knows who took that picture, but it&rsquo;s appeared hundreds of times in magazines and science textbooks, on blogs and laboratory walls. She&rsquo;s usually identified as Helen Lane, but often she has no name at all. She&rsquo;s simply called HeLa, the code name given to the world&rsquo;s first immortal human cells&mdash;<i>her </i>cells, cut from her cervix just months before she died.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Her real name is Henrietta Lacks.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve spent years staring at that photo, wondering what kind of life she led, whathappened to her children, and what she&rsquo;d think about cells from her cervix living on forever&mdash;bought, sold, packaged, and shipped by the trillions to laboratories around the world. I&rsquo;ve tried to imagine how she&rsquo;d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine&#58; the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that she&mdash;like most of us&mdash;would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>There&rsquo;s no way of knowing exactly how many of Henrietta&rsquo;s cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they&rsquo;d weigh more than 50 million metric tons&mdash;an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing. Another scientist calculated that if you could lay all HeLa cells ever grown end-to-end, they&rsquo;d wrap around the Earth at least three times, spanning more than 350 million feet. In her prime, Henrietta herself stood only a bit over five feet tall.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>I first learned about HeLa cells and the woman behind them in 1988, thirty-seven years after her death, when I was sixteen and sitting in a community college biology class. My instructor, Donald Defler, a gnomish balding man, paced at the front of the lecture hall and flipped on an overhead projector. He pointed to two diagrams that appeared on the wall behind him. They were schematics of the cell reproduction cycle, but to me they just looked like a neon-colored mess of arrows, squares, and circles with words I didn&rsquo;t understand, like &ldquo;MPF Triggering a Chain Reaction of Protein Activations.&rdquo;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>I was a kid who&rsquo;d failed freshman year at the regular public high school because she never showed up. I&rsquo;d transferred to an alternative school that offered dream studies instead of biology, so I was taking Defler&rsquo;s class for high-school credit, which meant that I was sitting in a college lecture hall at sixteen with words like <i>mitosis </i>and <i>kinase inhibitors </i>flying around. I was completely lost.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;Do we have to memorize everything on those diagrams?&rdquo; one student yelled.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Yes, Defler said, we had to memorize the diagrams, and yes, they&rsquo;d be on the test, but that didn&rsquo;t matter right then. What he wanted us to understand was that cells are amazing things&#58; There are about one hundred trillion of them in our bodies, each so small that several thousand could fit on the period at the end of this sentence. They make up all our tissues&mdash;muscle, bone, blood&mdash;which in turn make up our organs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Under the microscope, a cell looks a lot like a fried egg&#58; It has a white (the <i>cytoplasm</i>) that&rsquo;s full of water and proteins to keep it fed, and a yolk (the <i>nucleus</i>) that holds all the genetic information that makes you <i>you. </i>The cytoplasm buzzes like a New York City street. It&rsquo;s crammed full of molecules and vessels endlessly shuttling enzymes and sugars from one part of the cell to another, pumping water, nutrients, and oxygen in and out of the cell. All the while, little cytoplasmic factories work 24/7, cranking out sugars, fats, proteins, and energy to keep the whole thing running and feed the nucleus. The nucleus is the brains of the operation; inside every nucleus within each cell in your body, there&rsquo;s an identical copy of your entire genome. That genome tells cells when to grow and divide and makes sure they do their jobs, whether that&rsquo;s controlling your heartbeat or helping your brain understand the words on this page.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Defler paced the front of the classroom telling us how mitosis&mdash;the process of cell division&mdash;makes it possible for embryos to grow into babies, and for our bodies to create new cells for healing wounds or replenishing blood we&rsquo;ve lost. It was beautiful, he said, like a perfectly choreographed dance.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>All it takes is one small mistake anywhere in the division process for cells to start growing out of control, he told us. Just <i>one </i>enzyme misfiring, just <i>one </i>wrong protein activation, and you could have cancer. Mitosis goes haywire, which is how it spreads.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;We learned that by studying cancer cells in culture,&rdquo; Defler said. He grinned and spun to face the board, where he wrote two words in enormous print&#58; HENRIETTA LACKS.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Henrietta died in 1951 from a vicious case of cervical cancer, he told us. But before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta&rsquo;s were different&#58; they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>&ldquo;Henrietta&rsquo;s cells have now been living outside her body far longer than they ever lived inside it,&rdquo; Defler said. If we went to almost any cell culture lab in the world and opened its freezers, he told us, we&rsquo;d probably find millions&mdash;if not billions&mdash;of Henrietta&rsquo;s cells in small vials on ice.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; and they&rsquo;ve been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers.
