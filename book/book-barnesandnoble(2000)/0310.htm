His first collection of short fiction,<i> Ford County,</i> collects seven of those tales set in the titular Mississippi region where his characters are "always in the vicinity of trouble."  While none of the stories are out-and-out courtroom dramas, most of them are populated with felons, ex-felons, and the kind of lawyers of who are one bad decision away from a jail sentence.  In one story, three good ol' boys start driving to Memphis to donate blood for an injured friend, but they're distracted by beer joints and strip clubs along the way.  In another, a down-and-out divorce lawyer gets a second chance to make some big money on an old class-action lawsuit.  Like his literary predecessors Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, and that other icon from Oxford, Mississippi, William Faulkner, Grisham knows how southerners tick.  The characters in Ford County are rendered with great humor and tenderness; even the worst rapscallion and the slimiest scallywag can be loved here in these pages.  <i>Ford County</i> may just be Grisham's best book to date.  Gone are the problems which have long plagued his novels: paper-thin characters, trite dialogue, and sentences that tangle in a traffic jam of adverbs and adjectives.  By winnowing his "ideas" to the shorter form, Grisham has, by necessity, dispensed with the padding and come closer to richer, deeper writing than ever before.

This wholly surprising collection of stories reminds us once again why Grisham is America�s favorite storyteller.
</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Carolyn See</h3><p>Set in a small Mississippi town not unlike the one in which Grisham started practicing law, these seven stories seem so artless that the artlessness turns into an art. They're terrifically charming, if only for this one thing: They start out at a beginning and march straight through to an end. They lack plot twists, literary surprises, authorial showing off&#8230;stories that&#151;no matter what your literary scruples&#151;you absolutely can't stop reading.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>The master of the legal thriller, John Grisham was a criminal and civil lawyer in Mississippi when his first book, <i>A Time to Kill</i>, was published.

											I read A Time to Kill in 1990 for a pre-law course in college and it was nice to revisit with Harry Rex and Clanton, Mississippi.  The format of short stories was intriguing, as well, so I was pretty gung-ho about Ford County.  Here's what I came away with:  <p/>First, I wish the legal characters weren't always stereotypical jerks that have the paper-thin depth of Mack Stafford, Stanley Wade, etc...  Now that I think of it, other than Adrian, Emporia &amp; Sidney, most of the stories' players were two-dimensional shades of humanity.  <p/>Speaking of &quot;Lawyer Wade,&quot; wouldn't it have been more interesting if he could somehow have been able to rebutt Mr. Cranwell regarding the ethical restrictions/necessity for his client vs. the moral imperative to do the &quot;right thing&quot; in Michael's Room?<p/>  Blood Drive was just plodding stupidity and not the right beginning to an otherwise enjoyable read.  Should have reworked this a bit to give readers at least one marginally sympathetic character instead of three sub-par sluggards.<p/>Finally, I made the mistake of listening to this on CD.  As one or two other reviews have mentioned, Mr. Grisham desperately needs to rethink EVER reading his own work aloud again.  He's a talented writer whose inflection and tone are listless and the book coulda been better.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://video.barnesandnoble.com/DVD/The-Verdict/Paul-Newman/e/24543372295/?pv=y">The Verdict</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Presumed-Innocent/Scott-Turow/e/9780374237134/?pv=y">Presumed Innocent</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Time-to-Kill/John-Grisham/e/9780385338608/?pv=y">A Time to Kill</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Enjoyable as always<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=tarheels">tarheels</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1396588_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780385532457_BK_1_1396588" href="#previewReview_1396588" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 28, 2010: 
											I always enjoy reading his books. This one definately didn't disappoint. Whether he's writing short stories or regular books he knows how to lure you into the the book. I enjoyed reading about true cases from Ford County. It shows what people really go through. I would recommend this book to everyone. It makes a great gift.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/68240000/68241551.JPG" alt="" height="155" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>John Grisham</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Oxford, Mississippi, and Albemarle County, Virginia</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>February 08, 1955</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Jonesboro, Arkansas</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.S., Mississippi State, 1977; J.D., University of Mississippi, 1981</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.jgrisham.com">* John Grisham's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>As a young boy in Arkansas, John Grisham dreamed of being a baseball player. Fortunately for his millions of fans, that career didn't pan out. His family moved to Mississippi in 1967, where Grisham eventually received a law degree from Ole Miss and established a practice in Southaven for criminal and civil law. In 1983, Grisham was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives, where he served until 1990. <p>    While working as an attorney, Grisham witnessed emotional testimony from the case of a young girl's rape. Naturally inquisitive, Grisham's mind started to wander: what if the terrible crime yielded an equally terrible revenge? These questions of right and wrong were the subject of his first novel, <i>A Time to Kill</i> (1988), written in the stolen moments before and between court appearances. The book wasn't widely distributed, but his next title would be the one to bring him to the national spotlight. The day after he finished <i>A Time to Kill</i>, Grisham began work on <i>The Firm</i> (1991), the story of a whiz kid attorney who joins a crooked law firm. The book was an instant hit, spent 47 weeks on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list, and was made into a movie starring Tom Cruise. <p>    With the success of <i>The Firm</i>, Grisham resigned from the Mississippi House of Representatives to focus exclusively on his writing. What followed was a string of bestselling legal thrillers that demonstrated the author's uncanny ability to capture the unique drama of the courtroom. Several of his novels were turned into blockbuster movies.<p>     In 1996, Grisham returned to his law practice for one last case, honoring a promise he had made before his retirement. He represented the family of a railroad worker who was killed on the job, the case went to trial, and Grisham won the largest verdict of his career when the family was awarded more than $650,000. <p>    Although he is best known for his legal thrillers, Grisham has ventured outside the genre with several well-received novels (<I>A Painted House</I>, <I>Bleachers</I>, et al) and an earnest and  compelling nonfiction account of small-town justice gone terribly wrong (<I>The Innocent Man</I>). The popularity of these stand-alones proves that Grisham is no mere one-trick pony but a gifted writer with real "legs."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>A prolific writer, it takes Grisham an average</b> of six months to complete a novel.<p>    <b>Grisham has the right to approve or reject</b> whoever is cast in movies based on his books. He has even written two screenplays himself: <i>Mickey</i> and <i>The Gingerbread Man</i>. <p>    <b>Baseball is one of Grisham's great loves.</b> He serves as the local Little League commissioner and has six baseball diamonds on his property, where he hosts games.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>Here are some highlights from our exclusive 2004 interview with author John Grisham:</I> <p>    <b>On his prolific pace:</b><br>  "I hear writers say it really is hard to let go -- it's really hard, first of all, to start putting the words on the paper, and then once you've finished the thing, it's hard to send it off to New York -- that it's like letting go of a child. I'm just the opposite. When I start writing, the words and ideas come real fast, and once I'm done, I can't wait to get the thing off my desk, out of my house, off to New York, and published -- because I'm already writing the next book."<p>     <b>On being a lawyer vs. writing about them:</b><br>  "I closed my law office 13 years ago, and it was the happiest day of my life; I have not missed it for one moment. It's so much fun to write about lawyers, but I never enjoyed being a lawyer." <p>    <b>On how his life as a lawyer affects his writing:</b><br>  "I was so unhappy in that profession I would dream of ways to get out of it," he says. "I think that's just a memory I will take with me forever, because most of my characters -- most of my heroes or heroines -- are looking for a way out, or in the end they ride off into the sunset. Not always, but in 17 books it's happened almost all the time."<p>    <b>On comparing himself with his favorite writers:</b><br>  "I love to read people like John Steinbeck and William Styron, and people like that; some Hemingway, some Faulkner. I'll read a great novel, and I'll say, 'I'll never be that good!' I have to recognize my own limitations. I think where I am real good is putting a story together -- putting a plot together -- and being able to hook the reader fairly early on in an engaging story, and make the pages turn." <p>    <b>On a reason he's always loved to write:</b><br>  "I think it's just this fascination I have with escapism -- with being able to just chuck it all, and walk away." <p>     <b>On one of the secrets to his inspiration:</b><br>  "A hyperactive imagination, which I guess I was born with."  <p>    <b>On the characters of his prior books:</b><br>  "I forget about these people so fast. I get embarrassed all the time because I'll be at a bookstore signing books, and somebody will ask me a question about <i>The Partner,</I> or <I>The Brethren</I> or something I wrote five or six years ago, and I can't answer the question because I don't remember what happened. I really tend to forget about them real fast because I'm always thinking about the next book or the next two books or the next movie."<p>    <b>On "the good life" as a writer:</b><br>  "Hey, I'm the luckiest guy in the world -- I really feel that way! I get to work about six months out of the year writing a novel, the other six months, I watch baseball games, raise my kids, stay on the farm with my wife and the horses, and live a very easy life -- I'm very spoiled." <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</h3><p>In the years since his first novel, <i>A Time to Kill,</i> John Grisham said he has often returned to the people and places of that book: "I've had dozens of ideas for Ford County novels, almost all of which peter out for one reason or another...The good stories stick, but they're not always long enough to become novels."  His first collection of short fiction,<i> Ford County,</i> collects seven of those tales set in the titular Mississippi region where his characters are "always in the vicinity of trouble."  While none of the stories are out-and-out courtroom dramas, most of them are populated with felons, ex-felons, and the kind of lawyers of who are one bad decision away from a jail sentence.  In one story, three good ol' boys start driving to Memphis to donate blood for an injured friend, but they're distracted by beer joints and strip clubs along the way.  In another, a down-and-out divorce lawyer gets a second chance to make some big money on an old class-action lawsuit.  Like his literary predecessors Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, and that other icon from Oxford, Mississippi, William Faulkner, Grisham knows how southerners tick.  The characters in Ford County are rendered with great humor and tenderness; even the worst rapscallion and the slimiest scallywag can be loved here in these pages.  <i>Ford County</i> may just be Grisham's best book to date.  Gone are the problems which have long plagued his novels: paper-thin characters, trite dialogue, and sentences that tangle in a traffic jam of adverbs and adjectives.  By winnowing his "ideas" to the shorter form, Grisham has, by necessity, dispensed with the padding and come closer to richer, deeper writing than ever before.

								Carolyn See</h3><p>Set in a small Mississippi town not unlike the one in which Grisham started practicing law, these seven stories seem so artless that the artlessness turns into an art. They're terrifically charming, if only for this one thing: They start out at a beginning and march straight through to an end. They lack plot twists, literary surprises, authorial showing off&#8230;stories that&#151;no matter what your literary scruples&#151;you absolutely can't stop reading.</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Janet Maslin</h3><p>Mr. Grisham took seven of his unused plot ideas and turned each of them into a sharp, lean tale free of subplots and padding. At an average length of slightly over 40 pages, these narratives are shorter than novellas but longer than conventional short stories. For a fledgling author, this format would be a tough sell; for Mr. Grisham, it's a vacation from whatever grueling work goes into the construction of fully rigged best sellers. The change invigorates him in ways that show up on the page&#8230;His novels sometimes moralize; these short stories don't need to because they transform their agendas into pure, vigorous plot.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Returning to the setting of his first novel, A Time to Kill, longtime bestseller Grisham presents seven short stories about the residents of Ford County, Miss. Each story explores different themes-mourning, revenge, justice, acceptance, evolution-but all flirt with the legal profession, the staple of (former attorney) Grisham's oeuvre. Fans will be excited to settle back into Grisham's world, and these easily digestible stories don't disappoint, despite their brevity. Full of strong characters, simple but resonant plotlines, and charming Southern accents, this collection is solid throughout; though his literary aspirations may seem quaint, Grisham succeeds admirably in his crowd-pleasing craft while avoiding pat endings or oversimplifying (perhaps best exemplified in "Michael's Room," which finds a lawyer facing the consequences of successfully defending a doctor against a malpractice suit). As always, Grisham balances his lawyerly preoccupations with a deep respect for his undereducated and overlooked characters. <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Grisham's (www.jgrisham.com) first collection of short stories, in which he returns to the Ford County, MS, setting of his first novel, A Time To Kill (1989)&mdash;also available from Books on Tape and Random Audio&mdash;proves his talent beyond the genre of legal thriller. The author himself reads, his Southern accent adding to the authenticity of the characters, including a data collector from an insurance company with an aptitude for blackjack, a man dying of AIDS, and a trio of misfits on a road trip to Memphis. These are just some of the quirky individuals whose stories Grisham expertly weaves together in a crazy-quilt style to create a picture of life in Ford County. Listeners will love it; highly recommended.

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><b>Fetching Raymond</b><br>
Mr. McBride ran his upholstery shop in the old icehouse on Lee Street, a few blocks off
the square in downtown Clanton. To haul the sofas and chairs back and forth, he used a
white Ford cargo van with �McBride Upholstery� stenciled in thick black letters above a
phone number and the address on Lee. The van, always clean and never in a hurry, was a
common sight in Clanton, and Mr. McBride was fairly well-known because he was the
only upholsterer in town. He rarely lent his van to anyone, though the requests were more
frequent than he would have liked. His usual response was a polite �No, I have some
deliveries.�<p>
He said yes to Leon Graney, though, and did so for two reasons. First, the
circumstances surrounding the request were quite unusual, and, second, Leon�s boss at the
lamp factory was Mr. McBride�s third cousin. Small-town relationships being what they
are, Leon Graney arrived at the upholstery shop as scheduled at four o�clock on a hot
Wednesday afternoon in late July.<p>
Most of Ford County was listening to the radio, and it was widely known that things
were not going well for the Graney family.<p>
Mr. McBride walked with Leon to the van, handed over the key, and said, �You take
care of it, now.�<p>
Leon took the key and said, �I�m much obliged.�<p>
�I filled up the tank. Should be plenty to get you there and back.�<p>
�How much do I owe?"<p>
Mr. McBride shook his head and spat on the gravel beside the van. �Nothing. It�s on
me. Just bring it back with a full tank.�<p>
�I�d feel better if I could pay something,� Leon protested.<p>
�No.�<p>
�Well, thank you, then.�<p>
�I need it back by noon tomorrow.�<p>
�It�ll be here. Mind if I leave my truck?� Leon nodded to an old Japanese pickup
wedged between two cars across the lot.<p>
�That�ll be fine.�<p>
Leon opened the door and got inside the van. He started the engine, adjusted the seat
and the mirrors. Mr. McBride walked to the driver�s door, lit an unfiltered cigarette, and
watched Leon. �You know, some folks don�t like this,� he said.<p>
�Thank you, but most folks around here don�t care,� Leon replied. He was preoccupied
and not in the mood for small talk.<p>
�Me, I think it�s wrong.�<p>
�Thank you. I�ll be back before noon,� Leon said softly, then backed away and
disappeared down the street. He settled into the seat, tested the brakes, slowly gunned the
engine to check the power. Twenty minutes later he was far from Clanton, deep in the hills
of northern Ford County. Out from the settlement of Pleasant Ridge, the road became
gravel, the homes smaller and farther apart. Leon turned in to a short driveway that stopped
at a boxlike house with weeds at the doors and an asphalt shingle roof in need of
replacement. It was the Graney home, the place he�d been raised along with his brothers,
the only constant in their sad and chaotic lives. A jerry-rigged plywood ramp ran to the side
door so that his mother, Inez Graney, could come and go in her wheelchair.<p>
By the time Leon turned off the engine, the side door was open and Inez was rolling out
and onto the ramp. Behind her was the hulking mass of her middle son, Butch, who still
lived with his mother because he�d never lived anywhere else, at least not in the free world.
Sixteen of his forty-six years had been behind bars, and he looked the part of the career
criminal�long ponytail, studs in his ears, all manner of facial hair, massive biceps, and a
collection of cheap tattoos a prison artist had sold him for cigarettes. In spite of his past,
Butch handled his mother and her wheelchair with great tenderness and care, speaking
softly to her as they negotiated the ramp.<p>
Leon watched and waited, then walked to the rear of the van and opened its double
doors. He and Butch gently lifted their mother up and sat her inside the van. Butch pushed
her forward to the console that separated the two bucket seats bolted into the floor. Leon
latched the wheelchair into place with strips of packing twine someone at McBride�s had
left in the van, and when Inez was secure, her boys got settled in their seats. The journey
began. Within minutes they were back on the asphalt and headed for a long night.<p>
Inez was seventy-two, a mother of three, grandmother of at least four, a lonely old
woman in failing health who couldn�t remember her last bit of good luck. Though she�d
considered herself single for almost thirty years, she was not, at least to her knowledge,
officially divorced from the miserable creature who�d practically raped her when she was
seventeen, married her when she was eighteen, fathered her three boys, then mercifully
disappeared from the face of the earth. When she prayed on occasion, she never failed to
toss in an earnest request that Ernie be kept away from her, be kept wherever his miserable
life had taken him, if in fact his life had not already ended in some painful manner, which
was really what she dreamed of but didn�t have the audacity to ask of the Lord. Ernie was
still blamed for everything�for her bad health and poverty, her reduced status in life, her
seclusion, her lack of friends, even the scorn of her own family. But her harshest
condemnation of Ernie was for his despicable treatment of his three sons. Abandoning
them was far more merciful than beating them.<p>
By the time they reached the highway, all three needed a cigarette. �Reckon McBride�ll
mind if we smoke?� Butch said. At three packs a day he was always reaching for a pocket.
�Somebody�s been smokin� in here,� Inez said. �Smells like a tar pit. Is the air
conditioner on, Leon?�<p>
�Yes, but you can�t tell it if the windows are down.�<p>
With little concern for Mr. McBride�s preferences on smoking in his van, they were
soon puffing away with the windows down, the warm wind rushing in and swirling about.
Once inside the van, the wind had no exit, no other windows, no vents, nothing to let it out,
so it roared back toward the front and engulfed the three Graneys, who were staring at the
road, smoking intently, seemingly oblivious to everything as the van moved along the
county road. Butch and Leon casually flicked their ashes out of the windows. Inez gently
tapped hers into her cupped left hand.<p>
�How much did McBride charge you?� Butch asked from the passenger�s seat.<p>
Leon shook his head. �Nothing. Even filled up the tank. Said he didn�t agree with this.
Claimed a lot of folks don�t like it.�<p>
�I�m not sure I believe that.�<p>
�I don�t.�<p>
When the three cigarettes were finished, Leon and Butch rolled up their windows and
fiddled with the air conditioner and the vents. Hot air shot out and minutes passed before
the heat was broken. All three were sweating.<p>
�You okay back there?� Leon asked, glancing over his shoulder and smiling at his
mother.<p>
�I�m fine. Thank you. Does the air conditioner work?�<p>
�Yes, it�s gettin� cooler now.�<p>
�I can�t feel a thang.�<p>
�You wanna stop for a soda or something?�<p>
�No. Let�s hurry along.�<p>
�I�d like a beer,� Butch said, and, as if this was expected, Leon immediately shook his
head in the negative and Inez shot forth with an emphatic �No.�<p>
�There�ll be no drinking,� she said, and the issue was laid to rest. When Ernie
abandoned the family years earlier, he�d taken nothing but his shotgun, a few clothes, and
all the liquor from his private supply. He�d been a violent drunk, and his boys still carried
the scars, emotional and physical. Leon, the oldest, had felt more of the brutality than his
younger brothers, and as a small boy equated alcohol with the horrors of an abusive father.
He had never taken a drink, though with time had found his own vices. Butch, on the other
hand, had drunk heavily since his early teens, though he�d never been tempted to sneak
alcohol into his mother�s home. Raymond, the youngest, had chosen to follow the example
of Butch rather than of Leon.<p>
To shift away from such an unpleasant topic, Leon asked his mother about the latest
news from a friend down the road, an old spinster who�d been dying of cancer for years.
Inez, as always, perked up when discussing the ailments and treatments of her neighbors,
and herself as well. The air conditioner finally broke through, and the thick humidity inside
the van began to subside. When he stopped sweating, Butch reached for his pocket, fished
out a cigarette, lit it, then cracked the window. The temperature rose immediately. Soon all
three were smoking, and the windows went lower and lower until the air was again thick
with heat and nicotine.<p>
When they finished, Inez said to Leon, �Raymond called two hours ago.�<p>
This was no surprise. Raymond had been making calls, collect, for days now, and not
only to his mother. Leon�s phone was ringing so often that his (third) wife refused to
answer it. Others around town were also declining to accept charges.<p>
�What�d he say?� Leon asked, but only because he had to reply. He knew exactly what
Raymond had said, maybe not verbatim, but certainly in general.<p>
�Said thangs are lookin� real good, said he�d probably have to fire the team of lawyers
he has now so he can hire another team of lawyers. You know Raymond. He�s tellin� the
lawyers what to do and they�re just fallin� all over themselves.�<p>
Without turning his head, Butch cut his eyes at Leon, and Leon returned the glance.
Nothing was said because words were not necessary.<p>
�Said his new team comes from a firm in Chicago with a thousand lawyers. Can you
imagine? A thousand lawyers workin� for Raymond. And he�s tellin� �em what to do.�
Another glance between driver and right-side passenger. Inez had cataracts, and her
peripheral vision had declined. If she had seen the looks being passed between her two
oldest, she would not have been pleased.<p>
� Said they�ve just discovered some new evidence that shoulda
been produced at trial but wasn�t because the cops and the prosecutors covered it up, and
with this new evidence Raymond feels real good about gettin� a new trial back here in
Clanton, though he�s not sure he wants it here, so he might move it somewhere else. He�s
thinkin� about somewhere in the Delta because the Delta juries have more blacks and he
says that blacks are more sympathetic in cases like this. What do you thank about that,
Leon?�<p>
�There are definitely more blacks in the Delta,� Leon said. Butch grunted and mumbled,
but his words were not clear.<p>
�Said he don�t trust anyone in Ford County, especially the law and the judges. God
knows they�ve never given us a break.�<p>
Leon and Butch nodded in silent agreement. Both had been chewed up by the law in
Ford County, Butch much more so than Leon. And though they had pled guilty to their
crimes in negotiated deals, they had always believed they were persecuted simply because
they were Graneys.<p>
�Don�t know if I can stand another trial, though,� she said, and her words trailed off.<p>
Leon wanted to say that Raymond�s chances of getting a new trial were worse than
slim, and that he�d been making noise about a new trial for over a decade. Butch wanted to
say pretty much the same thing, but he would�ve added that he was sick of Raymond�s
jailhouse bullshit about lawyers and trials and new evidence and that it was past time for the
boy to stop blaming everybody else and take his medicine like a man.<p>
But neither said a word.
