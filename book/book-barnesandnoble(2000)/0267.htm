Here two very different women discover how to find their place in the world...no matter how out of place they feel. <br><b><br></b>Emily Benedict came to Mullaby, North Carolina, hoping to solve at least some of the riddles surrounding her mother's life. For instance, why did Dulcie Shelby leave her hometown so suddenly? Why did she vow never to return? But the moment Emily enters the house where her mother grew up and meets the grandfather she never knew&#151;a reclusive, real-life gentle giant&#151;she realizes that mysteries aren't solved in Mullaby, they're a way of life.<br><br><i>Here are rooms where the wallpaper changes to suit your mood. Unexplained lights skip across the yard at midnight. And a neighbor bakes hope in the form of cakes.<br><br></i>Everyone in Mullaby...
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>After the death of her mother, Dulcie, Emily moves in with her grandfather in Mullaby, NC, and learns of her mother's part in the Coffey family tragedy. Fortunately, not everyone holds Dulcie's past against Emily&mdash;Julia welcomes Emily with a cake and offers a shoulder to lean on, but Julia has troubles, too. She's working off the debt on her father's restaurant so she can sell it and open a bakery far from the town that dismissed her so easily as a teen. Things may change if the romantic Sawyer can persuade Julia to trust him with her heart or if Win Coffey can help Emily expose the truth of her mother's deepest secret. Wallpaper that changes with mood, a sweet scent to call one home, and boys who glow in the moonlight will make readers jealous they can't live in a magical world like Allen's. VERDICT That it is never too late to change the future and that high school sins can be forgiven&mdash;these are wonderful messages, but Allen's warm characters and quirky setting are what will completely open readers' hearts to this story. Nothing in it disappoints. Fans of Allen's Garden Spells will snap this up. [See Prepub Alert, LJ 11/1/09.]&mdash;Stacey Hayman, Rocky River P.L., OH

In college, she majored in literature  -- because, as she puts it,  "I thought it was amazing that I could get a diploma just for reading fiction. It was like being able to major in eating chocolate."  <p>    After graduation in 1994, Allen began writing seriously. She sold a few stories and penned romances for Harlequin under the pen name Katie Gallagher; but her big break occurred in 2007 with the publication of her first mainstream novel, <i>Garden Spells</I>, a modern-day fairy tale about an enchanted apple tree and the family of North Carolina women who tend it. <i>Booklist</I> called Allen's accomplished debut "spellbindingly charming," and the novel became a BookSense pick and a Barnes & Noble Recommends selection.<p>    Since then, Allen has continued to serve heaping helpings of  the fantastic and the familiar in fiction she describes as  "Southern-fried magic realism." Clearly, it's a recipe readers are happy to eat up as fast as she can dish it out.</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some interesting outtakes from our interview with Allen:</I> <p>    <b>"I love food. The comforting and sensual nature of food</b> always seems to find its way into what I write. <I>Garden Spells</I> involves edible flowers. My book out in 2008 involves southern and rural candies. Book three, barbeque. But, you know what? I'm a <I>horrible</I> cook."<p>    <b>"In college I worked for a catalog company</b>, taking orders over the phone. Occasionally celebrities would call in their own orders. My brush with celebrity? I took Bob Barker's order."<p>    <b>"I was a Star Wars fanatic when I was a kid.</b> I have the closet full of memorabilia to prove it -- action figures, trading cards, comic books, notebooks with �Mrs. Mark Hamill' written all over the pages. I can't believe I just admitted that."<p>    <b>"While I was writing this, a hummingbird came to check out</b> the trumpet vine outside my open window. I stopped typing and sat very still, mesmerized, my hands frozen on the keys, until it flew away. I looked back to my computer and ten minutes had passed in a flash."<p>    <b>"I love</b> being a writer."<p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2007, Sarah Addison Allen took some time out to talk with us about some of her favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  Every book I've ever read has influenced me in some way. Paddington Bear books and Beverly Cleary in elementary school. Nancy Drew and Judy Blume in middle school. The sci-fi fantasy of my teens. The endless stream of paperback romances I devoured as I got older. Studying world literature and major movements in college.  Who I am, what I am, is the culmination of a lifetime of reading, a lifetime of stories. <I>And there are still so many more books to read</I>. I'm a work in progress. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  This is a tough one. I'll take a random sample from my keeper shelves: <p>    <li><I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I> by Harper Lee -- I first read this in ninth grade. At the time I didn't understand why my Literature teacher placed such emphasis on Atticus. We had to write <I>entire essays</I> about Atticus. I didn't care about Atticus. I thought my teacher missed the point and it was clearly a story about the kids. I read it again in my twenties and said, "Oh." I read this book at least once a year now. <p>    <li><I>Good Dog, Carl</I> by Alexandra Day -- One of the best dogs I've ever owned was a funny, humble, cat-fearing Rottweiler, who was with me almost 11 years. The Carl series by Alexandra Day manages to capture the smart, kind side to these dogs. Sweet, funny stories told through beautiful illustrations. <p>    <li><I>I Am One of You Forever</I> by Fred Chappell -- The lovely way this book portrays a southern childhood, with its light use of magic realism, resonates with me. I remember reading the last line of this book, then turning the book over to look at the title...and getting chills. Read it and you'll see what I mean. <p>    <li><I>Cinderman</I> by Anne Stuart -- This book is out of print, but it's on my keeper shelf, all wavy and stiff from being dropped in the bathtub while I read it for the umpteenth time. It was a part of Harlequin American's More than Men series, a breakthrough for category romance at the time. It's so smart and smartly written, a wonderful romance with paranormal elements. <p>    <li><I>Beauty</I> by Robin McKinley -- I'm such a sucker for a Beauty and the Beast story. This is probably my favorite retelling. The language just blows me away. <p>    <li><I>Persuasion</I> by Jane Austen -- Of course I fell in love with this book for the romance, for the romantic notion of lovers reuniting. But I also found it interesting that, at 27, Anne had "lost her bloom." At the time I had this strange impression of everyone in the Regency period being prematurely gray. <p>    <li><I>Wide Sargasso Sea</I> by Jean Rhys -- I read <I>Jane Eyre</I> as a teenager and was swept away. I thought the madwoman in the attic was only a plot device to break Jane and Mr. Rochester apart and then bring them back together. <I>Wide Sargasso Sea</I> humbled me. It taught me to consider the story that isn't being told. <p>    <li><I>The Deep Blue Good-by</I> by John D. MacDonald -- My dad introduced me to this series. I love the atmosphere, the retro feel to the stories, and the surprising sensitivity of hardened Travis McGee. <p>    <li><I>The Country Bunny and the Little Gold Shoes</I> by Du Bose Heyward -- I remember reading this story as a child, and it remained vivid in my mind for years and years. I thought it was out of print until I walked into a bookstore one day and this book was set out with some others as part of an Easter promotion. I grabbed the book and hugged it. It was like seeing an old friend. <p>    <li><I>Second Nature</I> by Alice Hoffman -- I was first introduced to magic realism while studying literature in college, and I was immediately captivated by this technique of blending the supernatural and unusual into everyday life. But it was always a very deep story that was told, always very literary. Years later, I discovered Alice Hoffman and everything changed for me. She took magic realism and made it accessible, she made it romantic. She made me want to write it. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <I>Rear Window, To Catch a Thief, Vertigo, Roman Holiday,</I> and <I>Funny Face</I>. Two words: Edith Head. <p>    <I>Spirited Away</I>. I know I've watched this more than a dozen times. The fairy tale aspect enthralls, and so does the otherworldly beauty of the place. <p>    <I>Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion,</I> and <I>North and South</I>. I love these for their excellent adaptations of the books, but mostly I love them for Colin Firth, Ciaran Hinds, and Richard Armitage, respectively. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  At any given time I'm listening to the Cory Branan, Leonna Naess, Eve 6, the King's Noyse, Sean Paul, Green Day, the BoDeans, Buddy Holly, Nowell Sing We Clear...the list goes on and on. <p>    But I rarely listen to music while I write. I start typing the lyrics. <p>      <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  Books with quirky visuals. The Griffin and Sabine books. The Post Secret books. <I>The Merchant of Marvels and the Peddler of Dreams</I>. <I>The Short Life and Mysterious Death of Amy Zoe Mason</I>. Love, love, love these kinds of books. It's like getting an inside-out gift. You know what it is right away, then you open it up and find all the beautifully wrapped packaging inside. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  The thing most consistently on my desk as I write is a cat, a different one at different times of the day. I think I'm more a part of <I>their</I> ritual. <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  All in all, it took about 12 years of writing to get where I am today. <p>    There's an old hymn called "How Can I Keep from Singing?" That's what writing feels like to me. I went through a very long dry spell during which I wrote like a fiend but couldn't sell a thing. So I gave up and went back to school, determined to leave writing behind. But when writing is so much a part of who you are, how can you keep from writing? I lasted a semester. I started writing again and wrote <I>Garden Spells</I>. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Don't give up because of the dark days. Succeed in spite of them. The dark days make the bright days seem even brighter. So bright you can hardly stand it.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>In her latest enchanting novel, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Sarah Addison Allen invites you to a quirky little Southern town with more magic than a full Carolina moon.

Unexplained lights skip across the yard at midnight. And a neighbor bakes hope in the form of cakes.<br><br>Everyone in Mullaby adores Julia Winterson&rsquo;s cakes&mdash;which is a good thing, because Julia can&rsquo;t seem to stop baking them. She offers them to satisfy the town&rsquo;s sweet tooth but also in the hope of rekindling the love she fears might be lost forever. Flour, eggs, milk, and sugar . . . Baking is the only language the proud but vulnerable Julia has to communicate what is truly in her heart. But is it enough to call back to her those she&rsquo;s hurt in the past?&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;<br>Can a hummingbird cake really bring back a lost love?

Fortunately, not everyone holds Dulcie's past against Emily&mdash;Julia welcomes Emily with a cake and offers a shoulder to lean on, but Julia has troubles, too. She's working off the debt on her father's restaurant so she can sell it and open a bakery far from the town that dismissed her so easily as a teen. Things may change if the romantic Sawyer can persuade Julia to trust him with her heart or if Win Coffey can help Emily expose the truth of her mother's deepest secret. Wallpaper that changes with mood, a sweet scent to call one home, and boys who glow in the moonlight will make readers jealous they can't live in a magical world like Allen's. VERDICT That it is never too late to change the future and that high school sins can be forgiven&mdash;these are wonderful messages, but Allen's warm characters and quirky setting are what will completely open readers' hearts to this story. Nothing in it disappoints. Fans of Allen's Garden Spells will snap this up. [See Prepub Alert, LJ 11/1/09.]&mdash;Stacey Hayman, Rocky River P.L., OH
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>In Allen's newest sugar-and-spice Southern fantasy (The Sugar Queen, 2008, etc.), a teenage girl comes to live with her grandfather in a small town where oddity is a way of life. Raised by her selfless, politically active mother Dulcie in Boston, Emily has never met or heard about her grandfather until she comes to live with him in Mullaby, N.C., after Dulcie's sudden death. Emily immediately confronts unexplainable peculiarities: Grandfather Vance turns out to be a shy giant over eight feet tall; the wallpaper in Emily's room changes at will; strange white lights materialize at night in the woods outside her window; objects appear and disappear without reason. And then there are the locals' less-than-warm memories of Dulcie. Emily makes friends with Win, a teenage boy whose family secret requires him to stay inside at night. Win tells Emily that his uncle committed suicide because Dulcie cruelly exposed his secret to the town. Grandfather Vance's neighbor Julia, who has also befriended Emily, was Dulcie's classmate and acknowledges that in high school Dulcie-spoiled, rich and popular-mercilessly teased Julia, then a troubled teen who dyed her hair pink and cut herself. Julia left Mullaby when she was 16 and has come back for a temporary stay only because her father died. Until she pays off his debts, she is running his barbecue restaurant, where she has added cakes and pastries to the menu. What Julia doesn't tell Emily is that the night before she left Mullaby to attend a school for troubled girls in Baltimore, she made love with handsome preppy Sawyer and ended up pregnant. Sawyer, who assumed she had an abortion, is now pursuing Julia again, but there is a secret she has not told him.As the parallel romances of Emily and Win and Julia and Sawyer evolve, the secrets of Mullaby become sources of happiness rather than pain. Fans of Allen's brand of romantic whimsy won't mind the inconsistencies and lapses of logic, but others may cringe at the implausibility.

The legend of the Mullaby lights is front and center in this story.&#160; How do legends come to pass? What do they say about a culture or community? Can you imagine something like this happening in your town?&#160; Have you ever had a haunting or whimsical experience that led you to a valuable discovery?&#160; <br>&#160;<br>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In Mullaby, barbecue is a celebratory food, meant to be shared.&#160; It brings people together. On the other hand, for Julia, cake-baking is a solitary activity, a ceremony she performs alone to feel connected to someone she has lost. Why do you think food is so central to this story? What kind of meaning can cooking, baking, and food take on? What do they mean to you?&#160; What kind of food is your city/state known for?<br>&#160;<br>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Julia finds that baking cakes is the only way she can comfortably express what is truly going on in her heart.&#160; What hobby or talent allows you to reveal yourself more clearly to others?&#160; Is there something specific about you or something you are good at that you feel draws others to you?<br>&#160;<br>4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; From the moment they meet, Win and Emily seem unavoidably drawn to one another. What do you think is the cause of this connection and why does the bond between them grow so quickly? Do you think that this kind or romance would be possible if they were older? <br>&#160;<br>5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Julia takes an immediate liking to Emily, assuming a motherly role.&#160; What do you think drews Julia to Emily?&#160; Could it be that Julia needed Emily just as much as Emily needed Julia?&#160; Have you ever taken a nurturing stance in someone else's life only to find that they were truly the ones rehabilitating you?&#160; Furthermore, do you think the relationship between Emily and Julia helped open Julia up to Sawyer?&#160; If so, how?<br>&#160;<br>6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Despite the fact that Sawyer mistreated Julia in a painful way, she ultimately forgives him. Do you think that Sawyer deserved Julia&rsquo;s forgiveness? Do you think that you would forgive someone who had abandoned you in the same way? Do you think that there are limits on what a person can forgive?<br>&#160;<br>7.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the story, we see different characters mourning the loss of loved ones (Emily with her mother, Vance with his wife and daughter, and Julia with her daughter and father). What are the different ways these characters cope with their losses? What do you think their coping mechanisms say about who they are? <br>&#160;<br>8.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Julia only moves back to Mullaby under the self-enforced condition that she will leave in two years. Why do you think she returned to Mullaby to save her father&rsquo;s restaurant when their relationship had been so tenuous? Other than Sawyer, what persuades her to stay in her hometown? <br>&#160;<br>9.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Emily has one view of her mother, while the town has a very different view.&#160; And Grandpa Vance has yet another understanding.&#160; Who is/was the real Dulcie?&#160; Do you believe a person can truly change?&#160; How might Emily's life have been different if she had known the truth of her mother's past before coming to Mullaby?<br>&#160;<br>10.&#160; Many people in Mullaby could be considered misfits.&#160; From the most prominent family in town to Julia and Vance, there are a multitude of characters who have the experience of not fitting in.&#160; How does this affect their lives?&#160; How do some manage to use this to their advantage while others seem to suffer for it?&#160; What does this say about the power of belonging?&#160; Why do many people, particularly young people, feel the need to belong while others are determined to stand out?&#160; Which kind of person are you?<br>&#160;<br>11.&#160; Emily's grandfather is a loveable giant.&#160; She is completely taken aback when she first sees him.&#160; Have you ever met someone who did not meet your expectations at all?&#160; How so?&#160; Much the same, Julia and Stella's friendship seems like an unlikely pairing.&#160; What do you think they gain from their differences?&#160; What do you gain from the opposites in your life?<br>&#160;<br>12.&#160; At the end of the story, when Vance reveals the truth behind Dulcie&rsquo;s motivations for the midnight show in the park, Emily is at first incredulous that he has kept this secret for so long. Why do you think he took so long to reveal this? Do you think it was right of him to allow the town to think of her negatively?&#160; What would you have done if Dulcie were your daughter? <br>&#160;<br>13.&#160; At the beginning of the novel, Emily discovers the grandfather she didn&rsquo;t know she had, and at the very end, Maddie embarks on a relationship with Julia. What does this story tell us about our blood connections? Do you think that being related to someone binds you to them whether you know them personally or not? What do you think Julia and Maddie&rsquo;s relationship will look like five or ten years down the road?&#160;<P><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>It took a moment for Emily to realize the car had come to a stop. She looked up from her charm bracelet, which she&rsquo;d been worrying in slow circles around her wrist, and stared out the window. The two giant oaks in the front yard looked like flustered ladies caught mid-curtsy, their starched green leaf-dresses swaying in the wind.<br><br>&ldquo;This is it?&rdquo; she asked the taxi driver.<br><br>&ldquo;Six Shelby Road. Mullaby. This is it.&rdquo;<br><br>Emily hesitated, then paid him and got out. The air outside was tomato-sweet and hickory-smoked, all at once delicious and strange. It automatically made her touch her tongue to her lips. It was dusk, but the streetlights weren&rsquo;t on yet. She was taken aback by how quiet everything was. It suddenly made her head feel light. No street sounds. No kids playing. No music or television. There was this sensation of otherworldliness, like she&rsquo;d traveled some impossible distance.<br><br>She looked around the neighborhood while the taxi driver took her two overstuffed duffel bags out of the trunk. The street consisted of large old homes, most of which were showpieces in true old-movie Southern fashion with their elaborate trim work and painted porches.<br><br>The driver set her bags on the sidewalk beside her, nodded, then got behind the wheel and drove off.<br><br>Emily watched him disappear. She tucked back some hair that had fallen out of her short ponytail, then grabbed the handles of the duffel bags. She dragged them behind her as she followed the walkway from the sidewalk, through the yard and under the canopy of fat trees. It grew dark and cold under the trees, so she picked up her pace. But when she emerged from under the canopy on the other side, she stopped short at the sight before her.<br><br>The house looked nothing like the rest of the houses in the neighborhood.<br><br>It had probably been an opulent white at one time, but now it was gray, and its Gothic Revival pointed-arch windows were dusty and opaque. It was outrageously flaunting its age, spitting paint chips and old roofing shingles into the yard. There was a large wraparound porch on the first floor, the roof of which served as a balcony for the second floor, and years of crumbling oak leaves were covering both. If not for the single clear path formed by use up the center of the steps, it would have looked like no one lived there.<br><br>This was where her mother grew up?<br><br>She could feel her arms trembling, which she told herself was from the weight of the bags. She walked up the steps to the porch, dragging the duffel bags and a good many leaves with her. She set the bags down and walked to the door, then knocked once.<br><br>No answer.<br><br>She tried again.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>She tucked her hair back again, then looked behind her as if to find an answer. She turned back and opened the rusty screen door and called into the house, &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; The space sounded hollow.<br><br>No answer.<br><br>She entered cautiously. No lights were on, but the last sunlight of the day was coughing through the dining room windows, directly to her left. The dining room furniture was dark and rich and ornate, but it seemed incredibly large to her, as if made for a giant. To her right was obviously another room, but there was an accordion door closing off the archway. Straight in front of her was a hallway leading to the kitchen and a wide staircase leading to the second story. She went to the base of the stairs and called up, &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, the accordion door flew open and Emily jumped back. An elderly man with coin-silver hair walked out, ducking under the archway to avoid hitting his head. He was fantastically tall and walked with a rigid gait, his legs like stilts. He seemed badly constructed, like a skyscraper made of soft wood instead of concrete. He looked like he could splinter at any moment.<br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finally here. I was getting worried.&rdquo; His fluid Southern voice was what she remembered from their first and only phone conversation a week ago, but he was nothing like she expected.<br><br>She craned her neck back to look up at him. &ldquo;Vance Shelby?&rdquo;<br><br>He nodded. He seemed afraid of her. It flustered her that someone this tall would be afraid of anything, and she suddenly found herself monitoring her movements, not wanting to do anything to startle him.<br><br>She slowly held out her hand. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Emily.&rdquo;<br><br>He smiled. Then his smile turned into a laugh, which was an ashy roar, like a large fire. Her hand completely disappeared in his when he shook it. &ldquo;I know who you are, child. You look just like your mother when she was your age.&rdquo; His smile faded as quickly as it had appeared. He dropped his hand, then looked around awkwardly. &ldquo;Where are your suitcases?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I left them on the porch.&rdquo;<br><br>There was a short silence. Neither of them had known the other existed until recently. How could they have run out of things to say already? There was so much she wanted to know. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he finally said, &ldquo;you can do what you want upstairs&mdash;it&rsquo;s all yours. I can&rsquo;t get up there anymore. Arthritis in my hips and knees. This is my room now.&rdquo; He pointed to the accordion door. &ldquo;You can choose any room you want, but your mother&rsquo;s old room was the last one on the right. Tell me what the wallpaper looks like when you walk in. I&rsquo;d like to know.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Thank you. I will,&rdquo; she said as he turned and walked away from her, toward the kitchen, his steps loud in his wondrously large shoes.<br><br>Emily watched him go, confused. That was it?<br><br>She went to the porch and dragged her bags in. Upstairs, she found a long hallway that smelled woolly and tight. There were six doors. She walked down the hall, the scraping of her duffel bags magnified in the hardwood silence.<br><br>Once she reached the last door on the right, she dropped her duffel bags and reached to the inside wall for the light switch. The first thing she noticed when the light popped on was that the wallpaper had rows and rows of tiny lilacs on it, like scratch-and-sniff paper, and the room actually smelled a little like lilacs. There was a four-poster bed against the wall, the torn, gauzy remnants of what had once been a canopy now hanging off the posts like maypoles.<br><br>There was a white trunk at the foot of the bed. The name Dulcie, Emily&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s name, was carved in it in swirly letters. As she walked by it, she ran her hand over the top of the trunk and her fingertips came away with puffs of dust. Underneath the age, like looking though a layer of ice, there was a distinct impression of privilege to this room.<br><br>It made no sense. This room looked nothing like her mother.<br><br>She opened the set of French doors and stepped out onto the balcony, crunching into dried oak leaves that were ankle-deep. Everything had felt so precarious since her mother&rsquo;s death, like she was walking on a bridge made of paper. When she&rsquo;d left Boston, it had been with a sense of hope, like coming here was going to make everything okay. She&rsquo;d actually been comforted by the thought of falling back into a cradle of her mother&rsquo;s youth, of bonding with the grandfather she hadn&rsquo;t known she had.<br><br>Instead, the lonely strangeness of this place mocked her.<br><br>This didn&rsquo;t feel like home.<br><br>She reached to touch her charm bracelet for comfort, but felt only bare skin. She lifted her wrist, startled.<br><br>The bracelet was gone.<br><br>She looked down, then around. She frantically kicked the leaves on the balcony, trying to find it. She rushed back into the room and dragged her bags in, thinking maybe the bracelet had caught on one of them and slipped inside. She tossed her clothes out of them and accidentally dropped her laptop, which she&rsquo;d wrapped in her white winter coat.<br><br>But it wasn&rsquo;t anywhere. She ran out of the room and down the stairs, then she banged out of the front door. It was so dark under the canopy of trees now that she had to slow down until the light from the streetlights penetrated, then she ran to the sidewalk.<br><br>After ten minutes of searching, she realized that either she had dropped it on the sidewalk and someone had already taken it, or it had fallen out in the cab when she was toying with it and it was now on its way back to Raleigh&mdash;where the cab had picked her up at the bus station.<br><br>The bracelet had belonged to her mother. Dulcie had loved it&mdash;loved the crescent moon charm in particular. That charm had been worn thin by the many times Dulcie had rubbed it while in one of her faraway moods.<br><br>Emily walked slowly back into the house. She couldn&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d lost it.<br><br>She heard what sounded like a clothes dryer door slam, then her grandfather came out of the kitchen. &ldquo;Lilacs,&rdquo; she said when he met her in the foyer, where she had stopped and waited for him to notice her so she wouldn&rsquo;t startle him. How odd that he was the giant, yet she was the one who felt out of place.<br><br>He gave her a cautious look, like she was out to trick him. &ldquo;Lilacs?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;You asked what the wallpaper was in Mom&rsquo;s old room. It&rsquo;s lilacs.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Ah. It was always flowers, usually roses, when she was a little girl. It changed a lot as she got older. I remember once it was lightning bolts on a tar-black background. And then another time it was this scaly blue color, like a dragon&rsquo;s belly. She hated that one, but couldn&rsquo;t seem to change it.&rdquo;<br><br>That made Emily smile. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like her at all. I remember once . . .&rdquo; She stopped when Vance looked away. He didn&rsquo;t want to know. The last time he saw his daughter was twenty years ago. Wasn&rsquo;t he even curious? Stung, Emily turned away from him. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll go to bed now.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; he asked as he followed her at a distance. &ldquo;I went to the grocery store this morning. I bought some teenager food.&rdquo;<br><br>She reached the first step on the staircase and turned, which made him step back suddenly. &ldquo;Thank you. But I really am tired.&rdquo;<br><br>He nodded. &ldquo;All right. Tomorrow, maybe.&rdquo;<br><br>She went back to the bedroom and fell onto the bed. Mustiness exploded from the mattress. She stared at the ceiling. Moths had come in, attracted to the light, and they were hopping around the cobwebby chandelier. Her mother had grown up with a chandelier in her bedroom? This from the same woman who would lecture Emily if she left a light on in a room she wasn&rsquo;t using.<br><br>She reached over and pulled some of her clothes from the floor and buried her face in them. They smelled familiar, like her mother&rsquo;s incense. She squeezed her eyes shut, trying not to cry. It was too early to say this was a bad decision. And even if it was, there was nothing she could do about it. She could survive a year here, surely.<br><br>She heard the wind skittering dried leaves around the balcony, something she realized sounded remarkably like someone walking around out there. She moved the clothes from her face and turned her head to look out the open balcony doors.<br><br>The light from the bedroom illuminated the closest treetops in the backyard, but their limbs weren&rsquo;t swaying. She sat up and crawled off the bed. Once outside, she looked around carefully. &ldquo;Is anyone here?&rdquo; she called, not knowing what she would do if someone actually answered.<br><br>Something suddenly caught her eye. She quickly stepped to the balustrade. She thought she saw something in the woodline beyond the gazebo in the overgrown backyard.<br><br>There! There it was again. It was a bright white light&mdash;a quick, zippy flash&mdash;darting between the trees. Gradually, the light faded, moving back into the darkness of the woods until it disappeared completely.<br><br>Welcome to Mullaby, North Carolina, she thought. Home of ghost lights, giants, and jewelry thieves.<br><br>She turned to go back in and froze.<br><br>There, on the old metal patio table, sitting on top of a layer of dried leaves, was her mother&rsquo;s charm bracelet.<br><br>Where it hadn&rsquo;t been just minutes ago.<br><br>Too much wine.<br><br>That&rsquo;s what Julia would blame it on.<br><br>When she saw Stella in the morning, she would say, &ldquo;Oh, and that thing I said about Sawyer last night, forget it. It was just the wine talking.&rdquo;<br><br>As Julia made her way up to her apartment that evening, she felt vaguely panicked and not at all mellow&mdash;as summer wine on the back porch with Stella usually made her. She only had six months before she was free of this town again, six months that were supposed to be easy, the downhill slope of her two-year plan. But with one tiny slip of the tongue, she&rsquo;d just made things infinitely harder on herself. If what she said got back to Sawyer, he wouldn&rsquo;t let it rest. She knew him too well.<br><br>She opened the door at the top of the staircase and stepped into the narrow hallway. Nothing had been done to the upper story of Stella&rsquo;s house to make it look like an apartment. There were four doors off the hallway. One led to the bathroom, one to Julia&rsquo;s bedroom, one to a second bedroom that had been converted into a kitchen, and another to a tiny third bedroom that Julia used as a living room.<br><br>Years ago, after Stella&rsquo;s ex-husband had spent his way through Stella&rsquo;s trust fund, he&rsquo;d decided they should bring in renters for extra money, so he&rsquo;d put a long curtain at the top of the staircase and said, &ldquo;Voil&agrave;! Instant apartment.&rdquo; Then he&rsquo;d been surprised when there were no takers. Men of thoughtless actions are always surprised by consequences, Stella always said. The last year of his and Stella&rsquo;s marriage, he&rsquo;d started leaving a fine black dust on everything he&rsquo;d touched, proof of his black heart, Stella claimed. When she&rsquo;d discovered the black dust on other women&mdash;sprinkled on the backs of their calves when they wore shorts on summer days, and behind their ears when they wore their hair up&mdash;Stella had finally kicked him out. Afterward she got her brother to put a door at the top of the staircase, and a sink and an oven hookup in one of the bedrooms, hoping something good might come from finishing something her lousy ex-husband had started. Julia was her first tenant.<br><br>Initially, Julia had been uneasy about renting a place from one of her old high school enemies. But she&rsquo;d had no choice. Stella&rsquo;s apartment had been the only place Julia could afford when she&rsquo;d moved back to Mullaby. She&rsquo;d been surprised to find that despite their pasts, she and Stella actually got along. It was an unlikely friendship, one Julia still didn&rsquo;t know how to explain. Stella had been one of the most popular girls at Mullaby High, a member of Sassafras&mdash;what the elite group of pretty, sparkly girls had called themselves. Julia had been the girl everyone avoided in the hallways. She&rsquo;d been sullen and rude and undeniably strange. She&rsquo;d dyed her hair bright pink, worn a studded leather choker every day, and used eyeliner so thick and black that she&rsquo;d looked bruised.<br><br>And her father had tried so hard not to notice.<br><br>Julia walked down the hall to her bedroom. But before she turned on the light, she noticed a light coming from Vance Shelby&rsquo;s house next door. She went to her open window in the darkness and looked out. All the time she&rsquo;d lived in Stella&rsquo;s house, all the sleepless nights she&rsquo;d spent staring out this window, and she&rsquo;d never once seen a light in the upstairs bedrooms next door. There was a teenager on the balcony. She was just standing there, as still as snow, staring into the woods behind Vance&rsquo;s house. She was willow-branch thin, had a cap of yellow hair, and a sad sort of vulnerability was wafting from her, making the night smell like maple syrup. There was something familiar about her, and that&rsquo;s when Julia suddenly remembered. Vance&rsquo;s granddaughter was coming to live with him. This past week at Julia&rsquo;s restaurant, it was all anyone could talk about. Some people were curious, some were fearful, and some were outright mean. Not everyone had forgiven this girl&rsquo;s mother for what she&rsquo;d done.<br><br>Julia didn&rsquo;t like the thought of what the girl was in for. It made her feel stiff and anxious. Living down your own past was hard enough. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to live down someone else&rsquo;s.<br><br>Tomorrow morning, Julia decided, she&rsquo;d make an extra cake at the restaurant to take to her.<br><br>Julia undressed and got in bed. Eventually the light went off next door. She sighed and turned on her side and waited to cross another day off her calendar.<br><br>After her father&rsquo;s death almost two years ago, Julia had taken a few days off work to come back to Mullaby to get his affairs in order. Her plan had been to quickly sell his house and restaurant, then take the money and go back to Maryland and finally make her dream of opening her own bakery come true.<br><br>But things hadn&rsquo;t gone exactly the way they were sup- posed to.<br><br>She&rsquo;d quickly discovered that her father had been deeply in debt, his house and restaurant mortgaged to the hilt. Selling his house had paid off his home mortgage and a small part of his restaurant mortgage. But even with that, she would have barely broken even if she&rsquo;d sold the restaurant then. So she came up with her now-infamous two-year plan. By living very frugally and bringing in more business to J?&rsquo;s Barbecue while she was there, in two years she would have the mortgage paid off and could sell the restaurant for a tidy profit. She&rsquo;d been perfectly up-front about it with everyone in town. She would be staying in Mullaby for two years, but that did not mean she lived here anymore. She was just visiting. That was all.<br><br>When she took over the restaurant, J?&rsquo;s Barbecue had a modest but loyal following, thanks to her father. He had a way of making people feel happy when they left, smelling of sweet yellow barbecue smoke that trailed behind them like a dress train. But Mullaby had more barbecue restaurants per capita than any other place in the state, so competition was fierce. With her father&rsquo;s personal touch now gone, Julia knew the restaurant needed something to set it apart from the rest. So she started baking and selling cakes&mdash;her specialty&mdash;and it was an instant boon to business. Soon, J?&rsquo;s Barbecue was known not for just fine Lexington-style barbecue, but also for the best cakes and pastries around.<br><br>Julia always got to the restaurant well before dawn, and the only person there before her was the pit cook. They rarely talked. He had his job and she had hers. She left the day-to-day running of the place to the people her father had taught and trusted. Even though the barbecue business was in her bones, stuck there like spurs, she tried to stay as uninvolved as possible. She loved her father, but it had been a long time since she&rsquo;d wanted to be like him. When Julia was a child, before she&rsquo;d turned into a moody, pink-haired teenager, she used to follow him to work every day before school and gladly help with everything from waitressing to tossing wood into the smokehouse pit. Some of her best memories were of spending time with her father at J?&rsquo;s Barbecue. But too much had happened since then for her to ever believe she could be that comfortable here again. So she came in early, baked that day&rsquo;s cakes, and left just as the first early-bird customers arrived for breakfast. On good days, she didn&rsquo;t even see Sawyer.<br><br>This, as it turned out, wasn&rsquo;t a good day.<br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never guess what Stella told me last night,&rdquo; Sawyer Alexander said, strolling into the kitchen just as Julia was finishing the apple stack cake she was going to take to Vance Shelby&rsquo;s granddaughter.<br><br>Julia closed her eyes for a moment. Stella must have called him the moment Julia left her last night and went upstairs.<br><br>Sawyer stopped next to her at the stainless steel table and stood close. He was like crisp, fresh air. He was self-possessed and proud, but everyone forgave him for that because charm sparkled around him like sunlight. Blue-eyed and blond-haired, he was handsome, smart, rich, and fun to be around. And he was disgustingly kind, too, as all the men in his family were, filled to capacity with Southern gentility. Sawyer drove his grandfather to Julia&rsquo;s restaurant every morning just so he could have breakfast with his old cronies.<br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to be back here,&rdquo; she said as she put the last layer of cake on top of the dried-apple and spice filling.<br><br>&ldquo;Report me to the owner.&rdquo; He pushed some of her hair behind her left ear, his fingers lingering on the thin pink streak she still dyed in her hair there. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know what Stella told me last night?&rdquo; he asked.<br><br>She jerked her head away from his hand as she put the last of the apple and spice filling on top of the cake, leaving the sides bare. &ldquo;Stella was drunk last night.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;She said you told her that you bake cakes because of me.&rdquo;<br><br>Julia knew it was coming, but she stilled anyway, the icing spatula stopping mid-stroke. She quickly resumed spreading the filling, hoping he hadn&rsquo;t noticed. &ldquo;She thinks you have low self-esteem. She&rsquo;s trying to build up your ego.&rdquo;<br><br>He lifted one eyebrow in that insolent way of his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been accused of many things, but low self-esteem is not one of them.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;It must be hard to be so beautiful.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell. Did you really say that to her?&rdquo;<br><br>She clanged the spatula into the empty bowl the filling had been in, then she took both to the sink. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. I was drunk, too.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;You never get drunk,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me well enough to make blanket statements like &lsquo;You never get drunk.&rsquo;?&rdquo; It felt good to say that. Eighteen years she&rsquo;d been away. Look how much I&rsquo;ve improved, she wanted to say.<br><br>&ldquo;Fair enough. But I do know Stella. Even when she drinks, I&rsquo;ve never known her to lie. Why would she tell me that you bake cakes because of me if it wasn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I bake cakes. You have an infamous sweet tooth. Maybe she got the two tangled up.&rdquo; She walked into the storage room for a cake box, taking longer than necessary, hoping maybe he&rsquo;d give up and go away.<br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking a cake with you?&rdquo; he asked when she came back out. He hadn&rsquo;t moved. All the crazy-hot activity in the kitchen&mdash;waitresses going in and out, cooks going back and forth, the constant thump of barbecue being hand-chopped&mdash;and he was so still. She had to quickly turn away. Staring at an Alexander man too long was like staring at the sun. The image became imprinted. You could close your eyes and still see him.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving it to Vance Shelby&rsquo;s granddaughter. She got in last night.&rdquo;<br><br>That made him laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually giving someone a welcome cake?&rdquo;<br><br>She didn&rsquo;t realize the irony until he pointed it out to her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what came over me.&rdquo;<br><br>He watched her as she put the cake in the cardboard box. &ldquo;I like this color on you,&rdquo; he said, touching the sleeve of her white long-sleeved shirt.<br><br>She immediately pulled her arm away. A year and a half of avoiding this man since she&rsquo;d been back, then she had to go and say to Stella the one thing that would draw him to her like gravity. He&rsquo;d been looking for this excuse since the moment she came back to town. He wanted to get closer to her. She knew that. And it made her angry. How could he even think of picking up where they left off after what happened?<br><br>She reached over and closed the window above her table. It was always the last thing she did every morning, and sometimes it made her sad. Another day, another call unanswered. She picked up the cake box and took it with her out into the restaurant without another word to Sawyer.<br><br>J?&rsquo;s Barbecue was plain, as most genuine barbecue restaurants in the South were&mdash;linoleum floors, plastic tablecloths on the tables, heavy wooden booths. It was an homage to tradition. As soon as she&rsquo;d taken over, Julia had pulled down the tattered NASCAR memorabilia her father had tacked to the far wall, but she&rsquo;d been met with such protest that she&rsquo;d had to put it all back up.<br><br>She set the box down and picked up the chalkboard on the diner counter. She wrote the names of the day&rsquo;s cakes on the board&#58; traditional Southern red velvet cake and peach pound cake, but also green tea and honey macaroons and cranberry doughnuts. She knew the more unusual things would sell out first. It had taken nearly a year, but she&rsquo;d won over her regulars with her skill with what they already knew, so now they would try anything she made.<br><br>Sawyer walked out just as she set the chalkboard back on the counter. &ldquo;I told Stella I&rsquo;d come over with pizza tonight. You&rsquo;ll be there?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always there. Why don&rsquo;t the two of you sleep together and get it over with?&rdquo; Sawyer&rsquo;s Thursday pizza courtship of Stella had been going on ever since Julia had moved back to Mullaby. Stella swore there was nothing going on, but Julia thought Stella was being na&iuml;ve.<br><br>Sawyer leaned in close. &ldquo;Stella and I did sleep together,&rdquo; he said into her ear. &ldquo;Three years ago, right after her divorce. And before you think that sounds indiscriminate, I try to keep my actions regret-free these days.&rdquo;<br><br>She gave him a sharp look as he walked away. His casual, almost flippant, mention of it took her by surprise and made her feel cool and tart, like tasting lime for the first time.<br><br>She couldn&rsquo;t blame him for being a scared teenager when he&rsquo;d found out she&rsquo;d gotten pregnant from their one night together on the football field all those years ago. She&rsquo;d been a scared teenager, too. And they&rsquo;d made the only decisions they were capable of making at the time. For better or worse.<br><br>But she resented how easily he&rsquo;d gotten on with his life. It had been just one night to him. One regretful night with the freaky, unpopular girl he&rsquo;d barely even talked to at school. A girl who&rsquo;d been madly in love with him.<br><br>Oh, God. She wasn&rsquo;t going to fall into this role again. She couldn&rsquo;t.<br><br>Six months and counting and she would leave this crazy place and never think of Sawyer again.<br><br>With any luck.<br><br><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="product-related"><div class="btb-dsl-tc"><div class="btb-dsl-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-tc-acc"><div class="pr-width"><div class="wrap2lt"><h3 class="pr-selected accord-default-open"><a name="relatedAcc" href="#categoryTitle_Acc" data-cmelementid="Related Subjects_Accordion">Related Subjects</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on"><ul><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=13">Literary Styles &amp; Movements - Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=18">Family &amp; Friendship - Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=541">Women's Fiction</a></li></ul></div><div class="wrap2lt booksByThisAuthor"><h3 class="pr-selected"><a name="booksByThisAuthorAcc" href="#booksByThisAuthor_Acc" data-cmelementid="BooksByThisAuthor_Accordion" onclick="WebService.initialize({url:'http://services.barnesandnoble.com/v02_00/ProductSearch?Contributor=Sarah+Addison+Allen&amp;ProductType=Book&amp;ProductSort=Relevance&amp;ProductDetail=Brief&amp;Start=1&amp;Size=6&amp;AppId=bntemp&amp;bnoutput=jsonstring&amp;bncallback=webservicecallback', outputNode:document.getElementById('obbta'), StyleSheet:genericStyleSheet, moreLink:'http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Sarah+Addison+Allen', isBTOB:'false', ean:'9780553807219'});">More by This Author</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on" id="obbta"><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif" alt="loading animation"> loading...
