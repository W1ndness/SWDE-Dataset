A tour de force of metaphysical reality, it is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle&#8211;yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.<br><br>Extravagant in its accomplishment, <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> displays one of the world&#8217;s truly great storytellers at the height of his powers.
</p><h3>The New York Times -

											Escaping the bounds of reality seems so simple in this amazing book by Japanese author Haruki Murakami, one of today's most original and mind-bending writers.  The translation from Japanese to English is absolutely stunning as the language is both vivid and detailed.  Following the story of a 15-year old boy as he finds his way through the mysteries of life, Murakami crafts a story that jolts the reader from concrete feelings to far-fetched imagery.  Let go of what you expect and know of the world and allow yourself to venture into this meandering tale full of surprising twists and turns.  Murakami's greatest feat is his ability to make what is surely impossible seem so real and lifelike - from a man who can talk to cats, to strange characters who resemble familiar characters from modern day product marketing like Johnny Walker and Colonel Sanders.  The tale is told in such a way as to suggest a dreamlike state where life isn't what you expect, and is much more vivid than we normally allow.  <p/><p/>Not a love story, exactly.  Not a coming of age parable, either.  Not a thriller or mystery.  And yet, it weaves together elements of all of these into one masterful piece of writing that will keep you glued to the pages.  Set in modern-day Japan, the story is filled with contemporary references, making the situations seem entirely plausible.  But as the plot twists and meanders, it is clear that what you are reading requires a suspension of reality and a willingness to take in the well-crafted writing as merely a different way to see things.  <p/><p/>Kafka Tamura finds love and adventure as he fights to uncover the power of his father's oedipal prophecy.  As he travels Japan as a runaway, he finds himself wondering if his path is chosen for him as fate, or if he is living a life of coincidence.  While wondering, but not searching, for the mother who left him as a young child, his only sister gone with her, he discovers much more than he bargained for.  <p/><p/>Having lived in Japan, the descriptions of the people and the places immediately drew me back to times spent in this friendly, yet oftentimes exotic locale.  Reading Kafka on the Shore made Japan seem less foreign, and more strange at the same time.  The language is compelling, even as it has been translated to English - a notable feat not generally achieved.  <p/><p/>Murakami will be regarded as one of the world's most unique and creative fiction writers and Kafka on the Shore is the perfect example of all he brings to the written page.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Quirky story<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1355668_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781400079278_BK_24_1355668" href="#previewReview_1355668" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>April 10, 2010: 
											This is a very, very unusual story, but involving, original and quirky - although found it a bit slow to get into.  The plot evolves slowly and it takes a while to really understand what the book is about. Everything about this story is unusual and original - the plot is very, very surreal.  The main elements of the plot are very ordinary - a teenager, a young man, a middle aged woman.  However, each of the characters has their own issues and are very interesting.  The plot involves ghosts, demons, spirits, etc, so it is very escapist or, as mentioned, surreal.  The fact that it takes place in Japan increases the sense of originality as I (an American) read the book.  It is enjoyable to read about the sites and historical stories from Japan  Finally, the imagery is also very good.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35706224.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Haruki Murakami</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Tokyo, Japan</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>January 12, 1949</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Kyoto, Japan</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Waseda University, 1973</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Yomiuri Literary Prize, 1996</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.harukimurakami.com">* Haruki Murakami's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>The The story of how Haruki Murakami decided to become a novelist says a lot about his work, because it is as strange and culturally diffuse as the works he writes. While watching a baseball game in Toyko in 1978 between the Yakult Swallows and the Hiroshima Carp, Murakami witnessed an American hit a double. At the crack of the bat, Murakami -- who had never had any ambition to write because he assumed he didn't have the talent -- decided that he should begin a novel. He then started his first book, in the night hours after work. <P>    If you're waiting for a connection between the double and the epiphany, there isn't one. It's often that way in Murakami's fiction, where cultures blend and seemingly incongruous, inexplicable events move the story forward. People disappear or transform as quickly as the worlds around them, and the result is a dreamlike atmosphere that blends mystery, magic realism and sci-fi while remaining unmistakably distinct from all three.<p>    Murakami was brought up in a suburb of Kobe by parents who were teachers of Japanese literature; but the literature of his parents did not interest him and he read mostly American authors, listened to American jazz and watched American shows. For this reason, though his books are set in Japan and originally written in Japanese, they do not seem terribly foreign to English speakers. <i>South of the Border, West of the Sun</i>'s title derives from a Nat King Cole song; and you're as likely to find a reference to McDonald's, Cutty Sark or F. Scott Fitzgerald as you are to anything Japanese. <p>    Murakami began his career with the coming-of-age novels <I>Hear the Wind Sing</I> and <I>Pinball 1973</I>, but he hit his stride with <I>A Wild Sheep Chase</I>, a novel about a twentysomething ad executive who is drawn into the quest for an elusive, mutant sheep. The novel appeared in the U.S. seven years after its 1982 publication, introducing American audiences to this unclassifiable author. It contained many of the traits that mark Murakami's novels: a solitary male protagonist who drifts just outside society; first-person narration; and philosophical passages nestled within outlandish, unconventional plots. An admiring <I>New York Times Book Review</I> called Murakami a "mythmaker for the millennium."<p>    The author's commercial breakthrough in Japan had come with the publication of <i>Norwegian Wood</i> in 1987, which sold two million copies. The story of a man who becomes involved with his best friend's girlfriend after the friend's suicide, it stands alone as the author's most straightforward, realistic work. Murakami acknowledges the book's impact on his career, and stands behind it; but he is also aware that it represented a departure from the surreal books that had made him a "cult" author with a modest following. "After <i>Norwegian Wood</i>, I have not written any purely realistic novels," Murakami said in a 2001 publisher's interview, "and have no intention of writing any more at this time."<p>  Murakami's return to surrealism with <i>Dance Dance Dance</I> (the sequel to <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i>), however, did not slow his career growth. Further translations of his work and publication of his stories in the <I>New Yorker</I> assured a growing following in the States, where his best known (and, to some, his best) work is <I>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</I>, which appeared here in 1997. It's a masterful work that draws together all of the themes Murakami had been exploring in his fiction up until then: modern ennui, the unpredictability of relationships, a haunting backdrop of Japanese history. <p>      In addition to his sublime and profoundly strange short stories and novels (<I>Sputnik Sweetheart</i>; <i>Kafka on the Shore</I>; <i>Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman</I>, etc.),  Murakami has made occasional forays into nonfiction -- most notably with <i>Underground</i>, a compilation of interviews with victims of the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, and his 2008 memoir of the New York City Marathon, <i>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</i>. He has also translated several works by American authors into Japanese, including title by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Carver, and John Irving.</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><B>Murakami owned</b> a small jazz bar in Tokyo for seven years after college, an experience that he enjoyed and called upon when creating the main character of <i>South of the Border, West of the Sun</i>, who also owns a Tokyo jazz bar.<p>      <b>Murakami's first three novels,</b> --  <i>Hear the Wind Sing</i>, <i>Pinball 1973</i>,  and <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i> --  comprise The Trilogy of the Rat.<p>      <b>His most often cited</b> influences are Raymond Chandler, Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan.<p>    <b>Murakami told an interviewer</b> from <i>Publishers Weekly</i> in 1991 that he considers his first two novels, <i>Hear the Wind Sing</i> and <i>Pinball 1973</i> "weak," and was not eager to have them translated into English. The translations were published, but are not available in the U.S. Third novel <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i> was "the first book where I could feel a kind of sensation, the joy of telling a story. When you read a good story, you just keep reading. When I write a good story, I just keep writing." <p>      <b>Daniel Handler, aka</b> children's author Lemony Snicket, is a vocal fan of Murakami's who once wrote a review/paean to the author in the <i>Village Voice</i> entitled "I Love Murakami." "Haruki Murakami is our greatest living practitioner of fiction," he wrote. "....The novels aren't afraid to pull tricks usually banned from serious fiction: They are suspenseful, corny, spooky, and hilarious; they're airplane reading, but when you're through you spend the rest of the flight, the rest of the month, rethinking life."<p>    <b>Murakami has taught</b> at Princeton University, where he wrote most of <I>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</I>, and Tufts University. The twin disasters of a gas attack on the Tokyo subway and the Kobe earthquake in 1995 drew the author back to Japan from the United States.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>With <i>Kafka on the Shore,</i> Haruki Murakami gives us a novel every bit as ambitious and expansive as <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,</i> which has been acclaimed both here and around the world for its uncommon ambition and achievement, and whose still-growing popularity suggests that it will be read and admired for decades to come.<br><br>This magnificent new novel has a similarly extraordinary scope and the same capacity to amaze, entertain, and bewitch the reader. A tour de force of metaphysical reality, it is powered by two remarkable characters&#58; a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle&#8211;yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.<br><br>Extravagant in its accomplishment, <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> displays one of the world&#8217;s truly great storytellers at the height of his powers.
</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Steven Moore</h3><p>Murakami's spin on this theme and the Oedipus myth is daringly original and compulsively readable, enabled by Philip Gabriel's wonderfully fluent translation. <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> is warmly recommended; read it to your cat.</p><h3>Nola Theiss

								KLIATT</h3><p>The two words that best describe this novel are "bewildering" and "metaphysical," yet the story is also incredibly readable. The hero describes himself as "the world's toughest 15-year-old," but in reality he is a well-heeled teenager who is either escaping a pre-ordained destiny or in search of his lost mother and sister?&#151;?so YAs can relate to his story. Then, there is the parallel story of Nakata, an old man who?&#151;?during a mysterious attack of either poisonous gas or poison mushroom during WW II?&#151;?was struck down for three weeks and became a simpleton with mysterious powers, like being able to talk to cats. His story adds to the texture and the confusion of the plot. Nonetheless, Marakami is such a good story teller that despite the unbelievable aspects of the plot, the endearing qualities of Nakata and the pluckiness of Kafka will keep the reader going through this lengthy modern novel. YAs will love discussing the meaning of the story and the significance of the characters, like the librarian who might, in Kafka's fantasies, be his mother, and even the mysterious appearance of Colonel Sanders. Well-written and confusing in the best possible way, this semi-fantasy will appeal to many YAs.  KLIATT Codes: SA&#151;Recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2005, Random House, Vintage International, 467p.,  Ages 15 to adult.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In this  highly surrealistic offering from distinguished Japanese author  Murakami (After the Quake: Stories), two seemingly unrelated  stories cleverly told in alternating chapters eventually collide  and meld. In the first story, a 15-year-old assumes the alias  Kafka Tamura and runs away from his home in Tokyo to Takamatsu.  While there, he is befriended by a young girl, hides out in a  private library, and seemingly falls in love with the library  director. Meanwhile, the elderly, feeble-minded Mr. Nakata, who  can talk with cats, encounters a series of unusual characters  with names like Johnny Walker and Colonel Sanders. Later  ensnared in a murder, Nakata leaves town and is befriended by a  young man who becomes his invaluable companion. Kafka and Nakata  are brought together when Nakata is compelled to search for the  "entrance stone" that connects their parallel worlds. Parts of  Murakami's story are violently gruesome and sexually explicit,  and the plot line following Nakata is rather eerie and  disturbing. Yet the bulk of this narrative is erudite, lyrical,  and compelling; followers of Murakami's work should approve.  Recommended for larger fiction collections.-Shirley N. Quan,  Orange Cty.

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Two mysterious quests form the core of Murakami's absorbing seventh novel, whose encyclopedic breadth recalls his earlier successes, A Wild Sheep Chase (1989) and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1997). In the first of two parallel narratives, 15-year-old Kafka Tamura drops out of school and leaves the Tokyo home he shares with his artist-sculptor father, to seek the mother and sister who left them when Kafka was four years old. Traveling to the small town of Takamatsu, he spends his days at a free library, reconnects with a resourceful older girl who becomes his de facto mentor, and begins to reenact the details of a mysterious "incident" from more than 60 years ago. In 1944, a group of 16 schoolchildren inexplicably "lost consciousness" during an outing in a rural mountain area. Only one of them, Satoru Nakata, emerged from the incident damaged-and it's he who, decades later, becomes the story's second protagonist: a childlike, scarcely articulate, mentally challenged sexagenarian who is supported by a possibly guilty government's "sub city" and possesses the ability to hold conversations (charmingly funny ones) with cats. With masterly skill and considerable subtlety, Murakami gradually plaits together the experiences and fates of Kafka and Nakata, underscoring their increasingly complex symbolic significance with several dazzling subplots and texts: a paternal prophecy echoing the Oedipus legend (from which Kafka also seeks escape); a faux-biblical occurrence in which things that ought not to be in the skies are raining down from them; the bizarre figures of a whore devoted to Hegel's philosophy; and an otherworldly pimp whose sartorial affectations cloak his true menacing nature; aghostly forest into which Russian soldiers inexplicably disappear; and-in glancing allusions to Japanese novelist Natsume Soseki-a clever homage to that author's beguiling 1905 fantasy, I Am a Cat. Murakami is of course himself an immensely reader-friendly novelist, and never has he offered more enticing fare than this enchantingly inventive tale. A masterpiece, entirely Nobel-worthy.

The first character to speak in <b>Kafka on the Shore</b> is the &#8220;boy named Crow&#8221; [p. 3]. Who is he? What part of Kafka Tamura&#8217;s psyche does he represent?<p><p>2. &#8220;Kafka,&#8221; we later learn, means &#8220;crow&#8221; in Czech. What relationship is Murakami trying to suggest between Franz Kafka, Kafka Tamura, the boy named Crow, and actual crows? At what significant moments do crows appear in the novel? What symbolic value do they have?<p><p>3. When Kafka meets Sakura on the bus, they agree that &#8220;even chance meetings . . . are the results of karma&#8221; and that &#8220;things in life are fated by our previous lives. That even in the smallest events there&#8217;s no such thing as coincidence&#8221; [p. 33]. What role does fate, or meaningful coincidence, play in the novel? Is it karma that determines Kafka&#8217;s destiny?<p><p>4. Much of the novel alternates between Kafka&#8217;s story and Nakata&#8217;s. What effects does Murakami create by moving the reader back and forth between parallel narratives? What is the relationship between Nakata and Kafka?<p><p>5. When Kafka is a young boy, his father tells him&#58; &#8220;<i>Someday you will murder your father and be with your mother</i>&#8221; [p. 202], the same destiny as Oedipus. Kafka&#8217;s father also tells him that he will sleep with his sister and that there is nothing he can do to prevent this prophecy from being fulfilled. How do Kafka&#8217;s attempts to escape his fate bring him closer to fulfilling it?<p><p>6. The phrase &#8220;for the time being&#8221; is repeated throughout <b>Kafka on the Shore</b>. Why has Murakami chosen to use this qualifying statement so often? How is theconventional concept of time stretched and challenged by events in the novel? Why does Miss Saeki tell Kafka&#58; &#8220;Time&#8217;s rules don&#8217;t apply here. Time expands, then contracts, all in tune with the stirrings of the heart&#8221; [p. 219]?<p><p>7. In what ways are the boundaries between past and present, dreaming and waking, fantasy and reality blurred and often erased in <b>Kafka on the Shore</b>?<p><p>8. The teacher in charge of the children who lost consciousness in the woods during World War II writes to her professor many years later and tells him&#58; &#8220;I find the worldview that runs through all of your publications very convincing&#8212;namely that as individuals each of us is extremely isolated, while at the same time we are all linked by a prototypical memory&#8221; [p. 96]. How are the main characters of the novel&#8212;Kafka, Nakata, Oshima, Miss Saeki&#8212;&#8220;extremely isolated&#8221;? In what ways do they share a &#8220;prototypical memory&#8221;? What would that memory be?<p><p>9. Kafka Tamura seems, in some mysterious way, to be both Miss Saeki&#8217;s son and the ghost of her long-dead lover. How does Murakami intend us to understand this shifting and apparently impossible dual identity?<p><p>10. What is the relationship between Nakata&#8217;s quest for the &#8220;entrance stone&#8221; and Kafka&#8217;s journey into the forest?<p><p>11. In what ways can <b>Kafka on the Shore</b> be read as a love story?<p><p>12. The supernatural shape-shifter, who takes the form of Colonel Sanders, tells Hoshino that he is neither God nor Buddha but a kind of &#8220;overseer, supervising something to make sure it fulfills its original role. Checking the correlation between different worlds, making sure things are in the right order&#8221; [p. 284]. What are these different worlds? Is Colonel Sanders talking about parallel universes?<p><p>13. <b>Kafka on the Shore</b> is, for the most part, a realistic novel, yet it contains many magical elements&#8212;Nakata&#8217;s ability to talk with cats and make fish fall from the sky, the shape-shifting Colonel Sanders, the middle-aged Miss Saeki visiting Kafka as her fifteen-year-old self. What is Murakami saying about the nature of reality and our beliefs about it through these seemingly impossible episodes?<p><p>14. At the end of the novel, Oshima tells Kafka, &#8220;You&#8217;ve grown up&#8221; [p. 463]. In what ways has Kafka been changed by his experience? What are the most important things he has learned? Why does he feel he has entered &#8220;a brand-new world&#8221; [p. 467]?<p>
<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3>Cash isn't the only thing I take from my father's study when I leave home. I take a small, old gold lighter--I like the design and feel of it--and a folding knife with a really sharp blade. Made to skin deer, it has a five-inch blade and a nice heft. Probably something he bought on one of his trips abroad. I also take a sturdy, bright pocket flashlight out of a drawer. Plus sky blue Revo sunglasses to disguise my age.<br><br>I think about taking my father's favorite Sea-Dweller Oyster Rolex. It's a beautiful watch, but something flashy will only attract attention. My cheap plastic Casio watch with an alarm and stopwatch will do just fine, and might actually be more useful. Reluctantly, I return the Rolex to its drawer.<br><br>From the back of another drawer I take out a photo of me and my older sister when we were little, the two of us on a beach somewhere with grins plastered across our faces. My sister's looking off to the side so half her face is in shadow and her smile is neatly cut in half. It's like one of those Greek tragedy masks in a textbook that's half one idea and half the opposite. Light and dark. Hope and despair. Laughter and sadness. Trust and loneliness. For my part I'm staring straight ahead, undaunted, at the camera. Nobody else is there at the beach. My sister and I have on swimsuits--hers a red floral-print one-piece, mine some baggy old blue trunks. I'm holding a plastic stick in my hand. White foam is washing over our feet.<br><br>Who took this, and where and when, I have no clue. And how could I have looked so happy? And why did my father keep just that one photo? The whole thing is a total mystery. I must have been three, my sister nine. Did we ever really getalong that well? I have no memory of ever going to the beach with my family. No memory of going <i>anywhere</i> with them. No matter, though--there is no way I'm going to leave that photo with my father, so I put it in my wallet. I don't have any photos of my mother. My father had thrown them all away.<br><br>After giving it some thought I decide to take the cell phone with me. Once he finds out I've taken it, my father will probably get the phone company to cut off service. Still, I toss it into my backpack, along with the adapter. Doesn't add much weight, so why not. When it doesn't work anymore I'll just chuck it.<br><br>Just the bare necessities, that's all I need. Choosing which clothes to take is the hardest thing. I'll need a couple sweaters and pairs of underwear. But what about shirts and trousers? Gloves, mufflers, shorts, a coat? There's no end to it. One thing I do know, though. I don't want to wander around some strange place with a huge backpack that screams out, <i>Hey, everybody, check out the runaway</i>! Do that and someone is sure to sit up and take notice. Next thing you know the police will haul me in and I'll be sent straight home. If I don't wind up in some gang first.<br><br>Any place cold is definitely out, I decide. Easy enough, just choose the opposite--a <i>warm</i> place. Then I can leave the coat and gloves behind, and get by with half the clothes. I pick out wash-and-wear-type things, the lightest ones I have, fold them neatly, and stuff them in my backpack. I also pack a three-season sleeping bag, the kind that rolls up nice and tight, toilet stuff, a rain poncho, notebook and pen, a Walkman and ten discs--got to have my music--along with a spare rechargeable battery. That's about it. No need for any cooking gear, which is too heavy and takes up too much room, since I can buy food at the local convenience store.<br><br>It takes a while but I'm able to subtract a lot of things from my list. I add things, cross them off, then add a whole other bunch and cross them off, too.<br><br>My fifteenth birthday is the ideal time to run away from home. Any earlier and it'd be too soon. Any later and I would have missed my chance.<br><br>During my first two years in junior high, I'd worked out, training myself for this day. I started practicing judo in the first couple years of grade school, and still went sometimes in junior high. But I didn't join any school teams. Whenever I had the time I'd jog around the school grounds, swim, or go to the local gym. The young trainers there gave me free lessons, showing me the best kind of stretching exercises and how to use the fitness machines to bulk up. They taught me which muscles you use every day and which ones can only be built up with machines, even the correct way to do a bench press. I'm pretty tall to begin with, and with all this exercise I've developed pretty broad shoulders and pecs. Most strangers would take me for seventeen. If I ran away looking my actual age, you can imagine all the problems that would cause.<br><br>Other than the trainers at the gym and the housekeeper who comes to our house every other day--and of course the bare minimum required to get by at school--I barely talk to anyone. For a long time my father and I have avoided seeing each other. We live under the same roof, but our schedules are totally different. He spends most of his time in his studio, far away, and I do my best to avoid him.<br><br>The school I'm going to is a private junior high for kids who are upper-class, or at least rich. It's the kind of school where, unless you really blow it, you're automatically promoted to the high school on the same campus. All the students dress neatly, have nice straight teeth, and are boring as hell. Naturally I have zero friends. I've built a wall around me, never letting anybody inside and trying not to venture outside myself. Who could like somebody like that? They all keep an eye on me, from a distance. They might hate me, or even be afraid of me, but I'm just glad they didn't bother me. Because I had tons of things to take care of, including spending a lot of my free time devouring books in the school library.<br><br>I always paid close attention to what was said in class, though. Just like the boy named Crow suggested.<br><br><b>The facts and techniques or whatever they teach you in class isn't going to be very useful in the real world, that's for sure. Let's face it, teachers are basically a bunch of morons. But you've got to remember this&#58; you're running away from home. You probably won't have any chance to go to school anymore, so like it or not you'd better absorb whatever you can while you've got the chance. Become like a sheet of blotting paper and soak it all in. Later on you can figure out what to keep and what to unload.<br></b><br>I did what he said, like I almost always do. My brain like a sponge, I focused on every word said in class and let it all sink in, figured out what it meant, and committed everything to memory. Thanks to this, I barely had to study outside of class, but always came out near the top on exams.<br><br>My muscles were getting hard as steel, even as I grew more withdrawn and quiet. I tried hard to keep my emotions from showing so that no one--classmates and teachers alike--had a clue what I was thinking. Soon I'd be launched into the rough adult world, and I knew I'd have to be tougher than anybody if I wanted to survive.<br><br>My eyes in the mirror are cold as a lizard's, my expression fixed and unreadable. I can't remember the last time I laughed or even showed a hint of a smile to other people. Even to myself.<br><br>I'm not trying to imply I can keep up this silent, isolated facade all the time. Sometimes the wall I've erected around me comes crumbling down. It doesn't happen very often, but sometimes, before I even realize what's going on, there I am--naked and defenseless and totally confused. At times like that I always feel an omen calling out to me, like a dark, omnipresent pool of water.<br><br><b>A dark, omnipresent pool of water.<br><br>It was probably always there, hidden away somewhere. But when the time comes it silently rushes out, chilling every cell in your body. You drown in that cruel flood, gasping for breath. You cling to a vent near the ceiling, struggling, but the air you manage to breathe is dry and burns your throat. Water and thirst, cold and heat--these supposedly opposite elements combine to assault you.<br><br>The world is a huge space, but the space that will take you in--and it doesn't have to be very big--is nowhere to be found. You seek a voice, but what do you get? Silence. You look for silence, but guess what? All you hear over and over and over is the voice of this omen. And sometimes this prophetic voice pushes a secret switch hidden deep inside your brain.<br><br>Your heart is like a great river after a long spell of rain, full to the banks. All signposts that once stood on the ground are gone, inundated and carried away by that rush of water. And still the rain beats down on the surface of the river. Every time you see a flood like that on the news you tell yourself&#58; That's it. That's my heart.<br><br></b>Before running away from home I wash my hands and face, trim my nails, swab out my ears, and brush my teeth. I take my time, making sure my whole body's well scrubbed. Being really clean is sometimes the most important thing there is. I gaze carefully at my face in the mirror. Genes I'd gotten from my father and mother--not that I have any recollection of what she looked like--created this face. I can do my best to not let any emotions show, keep my eyes from revealing anything, bulk up my muscles, but there's not much I can do about my looks. I'm stuck with my father's long, thick eyebrows and the deep lines between them. I could probably kill him if I wanted to--I'm sure strong enough--and I can erase my mother from my memory. But there's no way to erase the DNA they passed down to me. If I wanted to drive that away I'd have to get rid of me.<br><br>There's an omen contained in that. A mechanism buried inside of me.<br><br><b>A mechanism buried inside of you.<br></b><br>I switch off the light and leave the bathroom. A heavy, damp stillness lies over the house. The whispers of people who don't exist, the breath of the dead. I look around, standing stock-still, and take a deep breath. The clock shows three p.m., the two hands cold and distant. They're pretending to be noncommittal, but I know they're not on my side. It's nearly time for me to say good-bye. I pick up my backpack and slip it over my shoulders. I've carried it any number of times, but now it feels so much heavier.<br><br>Shikoku, I decide. That's where I'll go. There's no particular reason it has to be Shikoku, only that studying the map I got the feeling that's where I should head. The more I look at the map--actually every time I study it--the more I feel Shikoku tugging at me. It's far south of Tokyo, separated from the mainland by water, with a warm climate. I've never been there, have no friends or relatives there, so if somebody started looking for me--which I kind of doubt--Shikoku would be the last place they'd think of.<br><br>I pick up the ticket I'd reserved at the counter and climb aboard the night bus. This is the cheapest way to get to Takamatsu--just a shade over ninety bucks. Nobody pays me any attention, asks how old I am, or gives me a second look. The bus driver mechanically checks my ticket.<br><br>Only a third of the seats are taken. Most passengers are traveling alone, like me, and the bus is strangely silent. It's a long trip to Takamatsu, ten hours according to the schedule, and we'll be arriving early in the morning. But I don't mind. I've got plenty of time. The bus pulls out of the station at eight, and I push my seat back. No sooner do I settle down than my consciousness, like a battery that's lost its charge, starts to fade away, and I fall asleep.<br><br>Sometime in the middle of the night a hard rain begins to fall. I wake up every once in a while, part the chintzy curtain at the window, and gaze out at the highway rushing by. Raindrops beat against the glass, blurring streetlights alongside the road that stretch off into the distance at identical intervals like they were set down to measure the earth. A new light rushes up close and in an instant fades off behind us. I check my watch and see it's past midnight. Automatically shoved to the front, my fifteenth birthday makes its appearance.<br><br>Hey, happy birthday, the boy named Crow says.<br><br>Thanks, I reply.<br><br>The omen is still with me, though, like a shadow.
