											I never would have picked up this book. I only read this book because I needed a book to read for a school requirement and I thought this book had a cool name and book cover. Once I started reading I was glued to the book and since it was short it didn't take me long to finish reading it. To me it was a good book to read and finish off the school year.<p/><p/>I for one marvel at the sea and all its inhabitants, but for me being on the sea I get seasick. I enjoyed this book the most because I don't go out on boats to often and it was like I was there listening to the Old Man speak aloud to himself. I felt as if I were the boy having all of these questions and thoughts in my head after seeing the Old Man and what had happened alongside his boat.<p/><p/>After finishing the book I wanted to read more. I read about the Old Man though his adversities that I wanted to read and imagine him going though helping the boy and the boy learning. I wanted to know what was going to happen to the thing that was attached to the side of his boat and if he would become famous. The book left me with many questions and just reading it without chapters made the book so suspenseful.<p/><p/>If I were to recommend this book to anyone I would recommend this book to children above the age of fourteen just ending school or starting summer vacation. Why, because I feel that it would make them wish to be at sea and enjoy its wonders as I have. To know what it feels like to catch a fish like I have, except I only fished in freshwater. I want them to know that adults can be friends as well as teachers.<p/><p/>As a Boy Scout, that I am I know to be prepared unlike how the Old Man was on his journey. But I did learn something from him and I quote &quot;Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.&quot; And I was amazed at how he would do so much with so little. If he were to be a Boy Scout or if he was he would have been the best.<p/><p/>I didn't just give the book three stars for nothing under writing style, I thought there was something wrong with the way Hemingway wrote his book. He wrote sometimes in the third person and it sounded either really proper or really out there.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Holy Moly Crap.<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=ACDCGIRL">ACDCGIRL</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-2"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1375502_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780684801223_BK_24_1375502" href="#previewReview_1375502" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 05, 2010: 
											I had to read this book for a school assignment. At first, I was excited because from all reports it looked like a really good read. And it would have been, after all, Hemingway has great style and originality. However, all the fanfare led to dissapointment to me when he catches this giant marlin, tows it in despite the feasting sharks, and arrives on the docks with a skeleton, only to resume his dreary life. The ending was disgusting. And I've never been this disgusted with a classic, a genre that usually brings me joy.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35705168.JPG" alt="" height="144" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Ernest Hemingway</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>Ernest Miller Hemingway (full name)</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>July 21, 1899</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Oak Park, Illinois</p><p><strong>Date of Death</strong><br>July 02, 1961</p><p><strong>Place of Death</strong><br>Ketchum, Idaho</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Nobel Prize for Literature, 1954; Pulitzer Prize, 1952, for <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961), born in Oak Park, Illinois, started his career as a writer in a newspaper office in Kansas City at the age of seventeen. Before the United States entered the First World War, he joined a volunteer ambulance unit in the Italian army. Serving at the front, he was wounded, was decorated by the Italian Government, and spent considerable time in hospitals. After his return to the United States, he became a reporter for Canadian and American newspapers and was soon sent back to Europe to cover such events as the Greek Revolution. <p>    During the twenties, Hemingway became a member of the group of expatriate Americans in Paris, which he described in his first important work, <I>The Sun Also Rises</i> (1926). Equally successful was <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> (1929), the study of an American ambulance officer's disillusionment in the war and his role as a deserter. Hemingway used his experiences as a reporter during the civil war in Spain as the background for his most ambitious novel, <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> (1940). Among his later works, the most outstanding is the short novel, <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> (1952), the story of an old fisherman's journey, his long and lonely struggle with a fish and the sea, and his victory in defeat.  <p>    Hemingway -- himself a great sportsman -- liked to portray soldiers, hunters, bullfighters - tough, at times primitive people whose courage and honesty are set against the brutal ways of modern society, and who in this confrontation lose hope and faith. His straightforward prose, his spare dialogue, and his predilection for understatement are particularly effective in his short stories, some of which are collected in <I>Men Without Women</I> (1927) and <I>The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories</I> (1938). Hemingway died in Idaho in 1961. <p>  <I>� The Nobel Foundation 1954.</I></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P><i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> is one of Hemingway's most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal &#151; a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.</p><br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-custreview" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="loader" id="BK_9780684801223"><img alt="loading..." title="loading..." src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif"> Loading...</div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-fulldetails" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>Product Details</h3><div class="product-list-info"><div class="col-one"><ul><li class="pubDate">Pub.

After graduation from high school, he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he worked briefly for the <i>Kansas City Star.</i> Failing to qualify for the United States Army because of poor eyesight, he enlisted with the American Red Cross to drive ambulances in Italy. He was severely wounded on the Austrian front on July 9, 1918. Following recuperation in a Milan hospital, he returned home and became a freelance writer for the <i>Toronto Star.</i> <P> In December of 1921, he sailed to France and joined an expatriate community of writers and artists in Paris while continuing to write for the <i>Toronto Star.</i> There his fiction career began in "little magazines" and small presses and led to a volume of short stories, <i>In Our Time</i> (1925). His novels <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> (1926) and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> (1929) established Hemingway as the most important and influential fiction writer of his generation.

Hemingway died in Ketchum, Idaho, on July 2,1961.<P><b>Description</b><P> Santiago, an old Cuban fisherman who has not caught a fish for eighty-four days, goes far out to sea in his skiff alone because the young boy Manolin, who has fished with him and served him in the past, is prevented from continuing to do so by his parents, who are convinced that the old man has <i>salao,</i> bad luck. Santiago kills a giant marlin after fighting it for three days, lashes it alongside his skiff, and sails for home only to have his fish attacked by sharks during the night and devoured despite the old man's valiant efforts to kill them or drive them away. The morning after Santiago's return Manolin finds the old man sleeping in his palm shack, cries, brings him coffee, and pledges to replace lost equipment and to fish with him again, for there is much that he can learn.

Like other Hemingway characters, Santiago is very much alone, "beyond all people in the world" (p. 50); yet he says, "No man was ever alone on the sea" (p. 61). Why?

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P><Font size="+1"><b>INTRODUCTION&#58; THE RIPENING OF A MASTERPIECE</b></font><P>The April 1936 issue of <i>Esquire</i> contained an article entitled "On the Blue Water&#58; A Gulf Stream Letter," written by the magazine's featured contributor Ernest Hemingway. It was a rambling little piece that began with a debate between the author and a friend on the relative thrills of deep-sea fishing and big-game hunting. After a page or so of badinage, Hemingway embarks on a passionate apologia for the joys and beauty of life on the Gulf Stream. That and the other great ocean currents are "the last wild country left." He goes on to describe his own fishing experiences, adding stories told to him by his Cuban mate Carlos. One of the latter was about a giant marlin&#58;<P><blockquote>...an old man fishing alone in a skiff out of Caba&#241;as hooked a great marlin that, on the heavy sashcord handline, pulled the skiff out to the sea. Two days later the old man was picked up by fisherman sixty miles to the eastward, the head and forward part of the marlin lashed alongside. What was left of the fish, less than half, weighed eight hundred pounds. The old man had stayed with him a day, a night, a day and another night while the fish swamdeep and pulled the boat. When he had come up the old man had pulled the boat up on him and harpooned him. Lashed alongside the sharks had hit him and the old man had fought them out alone in the Gulf Stream in a skiff, clubbing them, stabbing at them, lunging at them with an oar until he was exhausted and the sharks had eaten all that they could hold. He was crying in the boat when the fishermen picked him up, half crazy from his loss, and the sharks were stillcircling the boat.</blockquote><P>This is clearly an almost perfect short short-story. It is also an unforgettable one, not only because of the strangeness of the event but also because it conveys an almost physical sensation to the reader.<P>I read it as a schoolboy of fifteen. In my boarding-school days, <i>Esquire</i> was frowned upon by our rector, Dr. Drury, on the grounds that it was "not manly." (I wonder how Hemingway might have responded to that criticism.) In any case, the story stuck in my mind ever after.<P>More important, it stuck in Hemingway's mind. Clearly he appreciated its value as the germ of a work of literature. Three years later, in a letter to his editor Max Perkins about a new book of short fiction he was planning to write, he mentioned <P><blockquote>one about the old commercial fisherman who fought the swordfish all alone in his skiff for 4 days and four nights and the sharks finally eating it after he had it alongside and could not get it to the boat. That's a wonderful story of the Cuban coast. I'm going out with old Carlos in his skiff so as to get it all right. Everything he does and everything he thinks in all that long fight with the boat out of sight of all the other boats all alone on the sea. It's a great story if I can get it right. One that would make the book.</blockquote><P>But the collection that was to contain that story never got written because one of the stories about the Spanish Civil War "took off," and before he knew it Hemingway had written fifteen thousand words and found himself well into the novel that was published the following year under the title <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls.</i><P>It was not until January 1951 &#151; fifteen years after its first appearance in <i>Esquire</i> &#151; that Hemingway returned to the "Santiago story," as he called it. He was living then in his home in Cuba and able to devote himself to the work. The writing went unusually well, and Hemingway was overjoyed by this surging of creative powers.<P>As he had originally planned to do, Hemingway took the external details of the story and presented them from the point of view of the fisherman. He thus made it possible for the reader to participate imaginatively in the story. That effect was always Hemingway's primary aim as a writer.<P>The story's spiritual themes enhance its meaning and impact. In the thoughts of Santiago, the reader shares the beliefs of a simple fisherman whose pride in his endurance is combined with the fatalistic sense that he has "gone out too far," and whose efforts to kill his prey are combined with a reverence for life. It is impossible to read this story without believing that in many respects it represents Hemingway's own ideals of manhood.<P>For a time, it was his plan to publish the tale as part of a collection, but he accepted an unusual offer to have it appear in a single installment in <i>Life</i> magazine. Its appearance in book form followed shortly.<P><i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was an immediate success throughout the world. It was specifically cited when the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Hemingway in 1954. In fact, its success was so great that it lead to a broad revival of interest in all of Hemingway's works which has continued to the present day. It is a curious fact of literary history that a story which describes the loss of a gigantic prize provided the author with the greatest prize of his career.<P>&#151; Charles Scribner Jr.<P>Copyright &copy; 1952 by Ernest Hemingway<P>Copyright renewed &copy; 1980 by Mary Hemingway</font><P><Font size="+1"><b>from <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i></b></font><P>He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally <i>salao,</i> which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.<P>The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck.

They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.<P>Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.<P>"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up.

The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana.
