											Instant Temptation by Jill Shalvis is a wickedly funny and smoking hot story.<p/><p/> <p/><p/>Harley Stephens needs an upcoming trek into the wilds of Wishful, CA to go off without a hitch. Her heart is set on getting the internship as a research biologist. This trip to check on her coyotes will seal the deal. One major problem is someone is killing her test subjects. Now the trip has taken a deadly turn. TJ Wilder has stuck his nose in her business and is insisting that she won't be going alone. This is just the icing on the cake for Harley. Seems she never got out of her head her one night with TJ and to make things worse he doesn't remember it at all.<p/><p/> <p/><p/>TJ Wilder pushes his self to limit everyday. A tragedy in his past has him feeling he doesn't deserve to be loved. He volunteers himself to watch out for Harley on her research trip. TJ didn't plan on being this attracted to her. He has always had feelings for Harley but could never figure out why she was so distant at times.<p/><p/> <p/><p/>Spending so much time together has the truth of their one night coming to light. Both Harley and TJ give into their mutual desires but Harley thinks it can't last since the research job is out of the state. But TJ has other plans.<p/><p/> <p/><p/>Instant Temptation puts the finishing touches on a sensational series by Jill Shalvis. TJ and Harley's bickering covers up a searing passion, which neither can ignore. Their relationship also has a good basis in friendship. This adds another layer to a delightful story. It was fun watching these two fall in love. In my book you can't go wrong picking up a Jill Shalvis novel.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>OMG<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Miss_Monk">Miss_Monk</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1385770_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780758231277_BK_1_1385770" href="#previewReview_1385770" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 14, 2010:

After six years of night  school, she'd recently completed her degree in wildlife biology. Six  <i>long</i> years of wrenching cars and trucks during the day and staying  up all night studying, and she still couldn't make ends meet.  <p>     But there was a silver lining. Thanks to her brand-new shiny  degree, she'd been granted a part-time internship as a research  biologist for a federal conservation agency, and if she impressed  them, she had a shot at the lone full-time research position in  their Colorado branch in the spring.  <p>     Since that job-unlike her internship-came with an actual  paycheck, impressing them had become Harley's biggest goal.  <p>     Her duties involved putting together data and analysis on a  species indicator report, which was seeking to answer questions  about western coyote populations. Itsounded a lot more impressive  than it actually was. In truth, there was almost no funding  for the project, and the staff consisted of two wildlife biologists  located in Colorado, and a few lowly, unpaid interns like herself  scattered throughout the states of California, Nevada, Idaho, and  Wyoming.  <p>     But for Harley, it was a foot in the door, because she intended  to get that job in Colorado.  <p>     When her belly rumbled, reminding her she'd skipped lunch,  she got up to look in the refrigerator. Unfortunately, the food  fairy hadn't paid her a visit, so her choices were questionable  cottage cheese, an apple, or the last of her emergency stash of  double fudge brownie ice cream. She'd been saving that for an  extreme disaster, but the possibility of getting evicted for not  paying her rent seemed pretty extreme.  <p>     She'd just stuffed a large bite into her mouth, and was moaning  over the sweet chocolate melting on her tongue when her  phone rang.  <p>     She looked at it with the same caution she'd give a piqued rattlesnake.  It was probably her landlord. Or maybe it was her mom  wanting to bring her some tofu concoction in thanks for helping  her meet her mortgage this month. Or her father wanting to crash  on her couch, since the fun-loving hippie had probably pissed off  his latest lover and had nowhere else to go. It could be her sister  Skye wanting to mooch food and/or cash, which-no surprise-was  in shockingly low supply. Harley loved her family, she really  did, but she couldn't seem to master their carefree, no-worries  attitude.  <p>     Not when the worries kept piling up.  <p>     The phone stopped ringing before her machine picked up.  <p>     Blowing out a relieved sigh, shaking off her sense of impending  doom, Harley looked down at her coveralls. It was a good day,  relatively speaking, as she had only one grease stain streaked down  a thigh and another on her bare arm. Not bad. She could probably  get it off with fingernail polish remover. Lifting her spoon,  she used it as a mirror. She wasn't vain. She knew she had an okay  shape thanks to a decent metabolism, but seeing as she wasn't all  that into makeup or fashion, she rarely did anything to accent  her attributes. She took a quick inventory of her face and realized  she'd spoken too soon about not being all that filthy, since  she had another grease streak over her forehead.  <p>     Good thing she didn't have a date tonight.  <p>     Hey, look at that. Another silver lining to the crap that was  her life.  <p>     The sorry truth was, she'd had only two dates in recent memory.  Both with Nolan, her friend and boss. True, one of those  dates had been more of an accident than anything else when  she'd had to change out his alternator and drive him into South  Shore for a meeting. But still, it was two dates more than she'd  had in at least six months.  <p>     Tonight would have been their third night out, which would  have been great because it was his turn to buy dinner, except  he'd gotten stuck in Placerville and wouldn't be home until too  late.  <p>     But if things were as really, really hot between them as she'd  claimed to TJ, "too late" wouldn't have been a problem, a little  voice inside her said.  <p>     <i>There are so many sparks between me and Nolan, our clothes  catch fire every time we're near each other.</i>  <p>     God. She'd actually said those words out loud to TJ, who'd  smiled that smile, the one that gave her goose bumps, as he'd  whispered "liar."  <p>     Arrogant, cocky ass.  <p>     But he was one <i>gorgeous</i> arrogant, cocky ass.  <p>     She let out a shuddery sigh, the kind only good chocolate or a  good-looking guy could cause and continued to eat her ice  cream. When the knock came, she stared at her door, then slowly  moved to look through the peephole.  <p>     Damn.  <p>     It was the <i>gorgeous ass</i> in person, looking a little hot and  tired, as if, like her, he'd just come in from a long day. She remained  still in indecision, blowing out a sigh when he merely arched a  brow at her.  <p>     She said nothing when she opened the door, which wasn't polite,  but she wasn't feeling polite. She was feeling out of control,  unnerved, and off balance-three things that TJ Wilder probably  never felt.  <p>     Something else he apparently didn't feel-the need to fill a silence.  Instead he stood there, well over six feet of hard muscle  and testosterone, doing what he'd been doing all her life without  even trying-affecting her brain cells, turning them to mush.  <p>     Yes, just looking at him turned her from an educated biologist  into a drooling imbecile. It wasn't her fault he'd been blessed by  the gene gods. He had a lot of sun-kissed brown hair, wavy and  unruly, falling over his forehead, and deep-set, assessing, sharp  green eyes that missed exactly nothing. He was tanned from long  days in the high-altitude sun spent trekking and guiding across  trails that would make a city guy's bowels go weak. And then  there was his body, honed to solid, ungiving sinew wrapped in a  healthy dose of <i>male</i>.  <p>     "Why are you here?" she asked. Not exactly as friendly a greeting  as Nolan would have received, but her reasons for not being  comfortable with TJ were as complicated as everything else in  her life at the moment.  <p>     His eyes said he'd registered her tone and was thinking about  smiling. "You going to invite me in?"  <p>     Ah, he speaks. But no. Hell, no. That would be like inviting in  the big bad wolf. She shook her head and simultaneously swallowed  another bite of ice cream, which naturally went down the  wrong pipe, and as the cold ache exploded behind her eyeballs,  she choked.  <p>     Stepping in close, way too close for comfort, TJ ran a hand up  her back, patting her between the shoulder blades as she coughed  and gasped.  <p>     "Brain freeze?" he murmured, his hands still on her, which  was disconcerting enough, but added to that, he brushed against  her with all those tough muscles, the ones that could make a nun  ache to touch him, and in spite of her current and regrettable  lack of a sexual life, she was certainly no nun. If she were, she'd  be excommunicated for the thoughts she was having.  <p>     Yeah, she had brain freeze, and not just from the ice cream.  "Back up," she wheezed. "Give me space."  <p>     He obligingly took a step clear of her, managing to get inside  her apartment as he did, because after all, he was a slippery,  wily-as-a-fox Wilder. Their ancestors had created the wild, wild  west, emphasis on the wild, wild. In fact, it was rumored that the  Wilders were responsible for the addition of the second "wild."  That tendency had carried down through the generations, each  subsequent Wilder doing his best to live up to the name, most  ending up in jail or six feet under. Somehow though, the current  generation had escaped the worst of the bad genes, or at least  outgrown them.  <p>     For the most part.  <p>     Didn't mean he wasn't up for taking advantage of a situation.  "I didn't invite you in, TJ."  <p>     He just smiled.  <p>     He was built as solid as the mountains that had shaped his  life, and frankly had the attitude to go with them-the one that  said he could take on whoever and whatever and you could kiss  his perfect ass while he did so. She'd seen him do it, back in his  hell-raising, misspent youth.  <p>     Not that she was going there, to the time when he could have  given her a single look and she'd have melted into a puddle at his  feet.  <p>     <i>Had</i> melted into a puddle at his feet. Not going there.  <p>     Unfortunately for her senses, he smelled like the wild Sierras;  pine and fresh air, and something even better, something so innately  male that her nose twitched for more, seeking out the heat  and raw male energy that surrounded him. Since it made her want  to lean into him, she shoved in another bite of ice cream instead.  <p>     "I saw on Oprah once that women use ice cream as a substitute  for sex," he said.  <p>     She choked again, and he resumed gliding his big, warm hand  up and down her back. "<i>You</i> watch Oprah?"  <p>     "No. Annie does, and once I overheard her yelling at the TV  that women should have plenty of both sex <i>and</i> ice cream."  <p>     That sounded exactly like his Aunt Annie. "Well, I don't need  the substitute."  <p>     "No?" he murmured, looking amused at her again.  <p>     "No!"  <p>     He hadn't taken his hands off her. He still had one rubbing up  and down her back, the other low on her belly, holding her upright,  which was ridiculous, so she smacked it away. She did her  best to ignore the fluttering he'd caused, and the odd need she  had to grab him by the shirt, haul him close, and have her merry  way with him.  <p>     That was what happened to a woman whose last orgasm had  come from a battery-operated device instead of a man, a fact she'd  admit, oh <i>never</i>. "I was expecting your brother."  <p>     "Stone's working on Emma's 'honey do' list at the new medical  clinic, so he sent me instead. Said to give you these." He  pulled some maps from his back pocket, maps she needed for a  field expedition for her research. When she took them out of his  hands, he hooked his thumbs in the front pockets of his Levi's.  He wore a T-shirt layered with an opened button-down that said  WILDER ADVENTURES on the pec. His jeans were faded nearly white  in the stress spots, of which there were many, nicely encasing his  long, powerful legs and lovingly cupping a rather impressive  package that was emphasized by the way his fingers dangled on  his thighs.  <p>     Not that she was looking.  <p>     Okay, she was looking, but she couldn't help it. The man  oozed sexuality. Apparently some men were issued a handbook  at birth on how to make a woman stupid with lust. And he'd had  a lot of practice over the years.  <p>     She'd watched him do it.  <p>     Each of the three Wilder brothers had barely survived their  youth, thanks in part to no mom and a mean, son-of-a-bitch father.  But by some miracle, the three of them had come out of it  alive, and now channeled their energy into Wilder Adventures,  where they guided clients on just about any outdoor adventure  that could be imagined; heli-skiing, extreme mountain biking,  kayaking, climbing, <i>anything</i>.  <p>     Though TJ had matured and found success, he still gave off a  don't-mess-with-me vibe. Even now, at four in the afternoon, he  looked big and bad and tousled enough that he might have just  gotten out of bed and wouldn't be averse to going back.  <p>     It irritated her. It confused her. And it turned her on, a fact that  drove her bat-shit crazy because she was no longer interested in  TJ Wilder.  <p>     Nope.  <p>     It'd be suicide to still be interested. No one could sustain a  crush for fifteen years.  <p>     No one.  <p>     Except, apparently, her. Because deep down, the unsettling  truth was that if he so much as directed one of his sleepy, sexy  looks her way, her clothes would fall right off.  <p>     Again.  <p>     Wasn't that just her problem. The fact that once upon a time,  a very long time ago, at the tail end of TJ's out-of-control youth,  the two of them had spent a single night together being just about  as intimate as a man and a woman could get. Her first time, but  definitely not his first. Neither of them had been exactly legal,  and only she'd been sober.  <p>     Which meant only she remembered.  <p>     Not going there ... never going there again. "Thanks for the  maps," she said in a clear invite to leave.  <p>     Instead he reached for her spoon and stole a bite of her ice  cream.  <p>     Bastard. She'd bet her last buck-if she had one-that <i>he</i> wasn't  orgasm deprived. Only the orgasm deprived got her ice cream!  <p>     "I wanted to talk to you." He licked the spoon with his  tongue, flashing straight white teeth, and she remembered what  else he liked to do with that mouth.  <p>     She dragged her eyes off it and up to his eyes. "About?" she  asked suspiciously.  <p>     "Not here. I'll buy dinner."  <p>     "I don't go out to dinner with the big bad wolf."  <p>     He grinned. "Sometimes, Harley, you have to take a risk."  <p>     She wasn't real big on risk. Risk tended to end badly for her.  Such as staring at her insufficient bank balance. Such as holding  two jobs, neither of which was satisfying her. Such as waiting on  Nolan to make his move sexually, when she was so overcharged  she'd probably explode during her next shower.  <p>     Or the next time she leaned against the washer during the spin  cycle.  <p>     Unable to explain any of that, she turned and started to walk  into her kitchen. TJ hooked a finger into the back of her coveralls  and halted her progress.  <p>     "Let go," she said.  <p>     "In a minute. You're off to Desolation Wilderness for a few  days."  <p>     Her back was plastered to his chest, and it was a damn fine  chest. Strong. Broad and warm. "I have to check on the tracking  equipment. Several cameras aren't transmitting. Also I'm hoping  to catch sight of any of the three core coyote groups that we're  tracking. I've got a red, a blue, and a green group scattered through  Desolation."  <p>     "<i>Hope</i> to catch sight of them?"  <p>     "Well, honestly, they're so slippery, even with the GPS system  in place I'll settle for signs. DNA."  <p>     She heard his smile. "You mean you're going looking for coyote  shit."  <p>     She sighed. "Why do guys think anything to do with bodily  functions is amusing?"  <p>     "Because it is."  <p>     She rolled her eyes so hard they almost fell out of her head.  <p>     "Desolation, Harley? At this time of year?"  <p>     His mouth was disconcertingly close to her ear, and his voice,  low and husky, had a terrible habit of bringing her deprived body  to life. "I have to impress," she said. "I want that research job in  Colorado. And besides, it's September. It's the best time of year  to go. Only a very small chance of a snowstorm, and not quite  hot enough to fry an egg on a rock."  <p>     He said nothing to that, and not being good at loaded silences,  she squirmed free. "I don't know what the big deal is. You  take treks like this all the time. You just got back from two  months in Alaska."  <p>     "It's my job."  <p>     Right. She was just a mechanic and a part-time research biologist,  used to being either under a car or behind a computer. She  got that.  <p>     But she wanted a shot at being more. She wanted to say goodbye  to coveralls forever, good-bye to needing a degreaser in the  shower. She wanted to be excited about something, passionate.  Dammit, she wanted to stop feeling like a hamster on the wheel  and <i>live</i>.  <p>     Unfortunately, most of her internship consisted of staring at a  computer screen. Hell, <i>all</i> of her internship consisted of staring  at a computer screen. "All I have to do is fix two cameras," she said.  The cameras were vital to the study. Luckily, coyotes were creatures  of habit, and territorial for life. They made a den and tended  to stay in a very careful ten-mile radius of that den, even taking  the same path of travel along a fixed route on a daily basis. This  allowed the remote cameras to give humans a slice of coyote life.  <p>     When the cameras were functioning, that is. Which meant  <i>field trip</i>. She'd be hiking into the northwestern slope of Desolation,  a hundred-square-mile federal wilderness area west of Lake  Tahoe. True, it was some of the toughest, most rugged, isolated  land in the country. Most of it was roadless, trail-less, and devoid  of logging and grazing.  <p>     But she'd be getting out from behind her laptop.  <p>     "I get why you've been asked to do this," TJ said. "You're a  cheap resource."  <p>     "Hey."  <p>     "You're also sharp, intuitive, and probably the best intern  they've ever had."  <p>     While she processed that, both the compliments and the warm  fuzzies it sent skittering through her, he went on. "The question  is why do <i>you</i> want to do this? Why not just skip the internship  and apply directly for the job you want?"  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Instant Temptation</b> by <b>Jill Shalvis</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Jill Shalvis.
