So imagine Cornelia's delight when her very own Cary Grant walks through the door of the hip Philadelphia caf&eacute; she manages. Handsome and debonair, Martin Grace sweeps Cornelia off her feet, becoming Cary Grant to Cornelia's Katharine Hepburn, Clark Gable to her Joan Crawford. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, eleven-year-old Clare Hobbes must learn to fend for herself after her increasingly unstable mother has a breakdown and disappears. With no one to turn to, Clare seeks out her estranged father, and when the two of them show up at Cornelia's caf&eacute;, the lives of Cornelia and Clare are changed in drastic and unexpected ways. A cinematic and heartfelt debut that pays homage to the classic Cary Grant/Katharine Hepburn romantic comedy <I>The Philadelphia Story</I>, <I>Love Walked In</I> is sure to win over critics and readers of contemporary fiction.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Susan Adams</h3><p><i>Love Walked In</i> by Marisa de los Santos, is the kind of book that makes you want to hunker down on a chilly day in a comfy chair and read straight through 'til dark. The beginning is light, entertaining and inviting, the middle grows more serious, and then, toward the end, the violins really start to play in this poignant, heart-tugging story about a single woman and a little girl who develop an unlikely bond.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>An award-winning poet and critically acclaimed novelist, Marisa de los Santos lives in Wilmington, Delaware, with her husband and children.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><h3>Customer Reviews</h3><ul class="reviewBox"><li class="first">Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget " id="9780452287891_BK"><span class="avg-4 section_updateRating"></span></span></li><li>Ratings: 112<span id="numReviews">Reviews: 48</span></li><li><a name="seeAllReviewsContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-All-Reviews">See All Reviews</a></li><li><p class="writeReview"><strong><a name="writeReview_OverviewTab" class="section_writeReview" rel="nofollow" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-Write-A-Review" href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/WriteReview.aspx?EAN=9780452287891"></a></strong></p></li></ul><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Beautiful story!!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Allierina">Allierina</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1397735_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780452287891_BK_1_1397735" href="#previewReview_1397735" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 30, 2010: 
											I was a little confused when I first started reading this book. The switch between first and third person each chapter threw me off, but once I got used to it, I couldn't put it down!! It is a lovely story, and I adore how you have two separate story lines which eventually mesh into one by the end!! I definitely recommend it!</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>kind of blah..<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=wheeze">wheeze</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1391633_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780452287891_BK_1_1391633" href="#previewReview_1391633" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 19, 2010: 
											When I saw the description of this book, I immediately got excited. I love old movies like Casablanca and lovely people like Audrey Hepburn. After reading this book, i feel let down... The whole story starts off with two girls, who had much different lives. Cornelia, a thirty something bar manager dreams of finding her Prince Charming. Ever, since falling in love with A Philadelphia Story when she was 14, she dreams of a man just liked that. When Martin walks into her shop, she thinks her dream is finally comes true. A classic gentleman who loves her to every whim, yet hides secrets of his own. The other girl in the story, is Claire. A bright, list loving 11 year old who is stuck in her own kind of world. Her mom seems to drifting farther and farther from her, perhaps even sick. While her Dad, has never really been in her life. He has been there, but never showed any feelings toward her. Both of this women are going to realize how much their worlds will change... To be honest, there wasn't enough dialogue in the book for me. There was plenty of narrative to get going, but it didn't flow, it seemed to be pushed together, hard for me to focus on. I had to slowly read, and even sometimes reread the story to understand. It's definitely not my favorite book, and somewhat relieved I got it from the library, instead of spending my own money.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35704632.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Marisa de los Santos</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Wilmington, Delaware</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>August 12, 1966</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Baltimore, Maryland</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Un. of Virginia, BA in Eng; Sarah Lawrence College, MFA in Poetry; Un. of Houston, Ph.D. in Eng. and Creative Writing</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.marisadelossantos.com">* Marisa de los Santos's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Marisa de los Santos grew up in Baltimore and Northern Virginia and attended the University of Virginia. After graduation, she received her M.F.A. from Sarah Lawrence College and a Ph.D. in English Literature and Creative Writing from the University of Houston. She achieved her earliest success as an award-winning poet, and her work has been published in several literary journals. In 2000, her debut collection, <i>From the Bones Out</i>, appeared as part of the James Dickey Contemporary Poetry Series. <p>    De los Santos made her first foray into fiction in 2005 with the surprise bestseller <i>Love Walked In</i>. Optioned almost immediately for the movies, this elegant "literary romance" introduced Cornelia Brown, a diminutive, 30-something Philadelphian with a passion for classic film and an unshakable belief in the triumph of true love. In the much anticipated 2008 sequel, <i>Belong to Me</I>, de los Santos revisited Cornelia, now a married woman, newly relocated to the suburbs, and struggling to forge friendships with the women in her new hometown. <i>Belong to Me</I> was selected for the Barnes & Noble Recommends program.<p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>De los Santos' love affair with books</b> began at a young age. She claims to have risked life and limb as a child by insisting on combining reading with such incompatible activities as skating, turning cartwheels, and descending stairs.<p>    <I>Here are some interesting outtakes from our interview:</I><br>  <strong>"I'm addicted to ballet,</strong> completely head-over-heels for it.  I did it as a little kid, but took about a thirty year hiatus before starting adult classes.  I do it as many times a week as I can, but if I could, I'd do it every day!  In my next life, I'm definitely going to be a ballerina."<p>    <strong>"I'm terrible with plants,</strong> outdoor plants, indoor plants, annuals, perennials.  I  kill them off in record time.  I adore fresh flowers and keep them all over my house all year round because they're beautiful and already dead, but you won't find a single potted plant in my house.  So many nice people in the world and in books are growers and gardeners, but the sad truth is that I'll never be one of them."<p>    <strong>"I'm an awful sleeper,</strong> and the thing that helps me fall asleep or fall back to sleep is reading books from my childhood.  Elizabeth Enright's Melendy series and her two <i>Gone Away Lake</I> books, all of the <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> books, <i>Little Women</I>, <i>The Secret Garden</I>, the Narnia books, and a bunch of others.  I have probably read some of these books twenty, maybe thirty times.  I read them to pieces, literally, and then have to buy new ones."<p>    <strong>"I am crazy-scared of sharks </strong>and almost never swim in the ocean.  Yes, I know it's silly, I know my chances of getting bitten by a shark are about the same as my chances of becoming president of the United States, but I can't help it."<p>     <strong>"My favorite way to spend an evening</strong> is eating a meal with good friends.  The cheese plate, the red wine, the clink of forks, a passel of kids dancing to The Jonas Brothers and laughing their heads off in the next room, food that either I or someone else has cooked with care and love, and warm, lively conversation-give me all this and I'm happy as a clam."<P>    <strong>"I adore black and white movies,</strong> particularly romantic comedies from the thirties and forties.  I love them for the dialogue and for the whip smart, fascinating, fast-talking, funny women."<p>     <strong>"I am the only adult person</strong> I know who dislikes olives."<p>    <strong>"I'm crazy for fresh home-baked bread and butter.</strong>  I'd take bread over chocolate any day."<p>    <strong>"I play no musical instruments,</strong> but I sing up a storm in the car."<p>    <strong>"In my next life, </strong>I will speak five languages.  In this life, I speak one.  It's sad really."<p>    <strong>"My biggest guilty pleasure</strong> is <em>InStyle Magazine</em>.  My second is chewy candy.  Think gummy bears.  Think Twizzlers."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>In winter of 2008, Marisa de los Santos took time to talk with us about some of her favorite books, authors, and interests:</I><p>      <strong>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?<br></strong>  I read <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> when I was ten, I can't count how many times I've read it since, and every single time, I am utterly pulled in.  I don't read it; I live it.  I'm with Scout on Boo Radley's porch and in the colored courtroom balcony, and my heart breaks with hers at Tom Robinson's fate.  Over and over, the book lifts me up and sets me down into her shoes.  I remember the wonder I felt the first time it happened, the sudden, jarring illumination:  every person is the center of his or her life the way I am the center of mine.  It changed everything.  I know that sounds dramatic, but it's true.  That empathy is the greatest gift fiction gives us, and it's the biggest reason I write.<p>    <strong>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?<br></strong>  This is an impossible question, and any answer I give can't possibly be the full truth, the final word, but I can tell you the books that come to mind now.  I'll limit myself to books written for adults because my favorite children's and young adult novels could be a list all by itself.  What all these books have in common is amazing, breathtakingly alive, three dimensional, unforgettable characters.  For me, ultimately, I book lives or doesn't live because of its characters.<p><li>    E. M. Forster's <em>Howard's End</em> -- because I find the female characters, especially Margaret, endlessly interesting and completely real and because I love Forster's idea that truly knowing other people is what will save us.<li>    Zora Neale Hurston's <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> -- because I love the arc of Janie's character development, the way her spirit insists on itself even when she suffers the worst loss imaginable. <li>    George Eliot's <em>Middlemarch</em> -- because she is so sly and gives us a whole, very complicated world and can keep so many balls in the air at the same time.  Every strand of narrative amid all the many, many strands is completely captivating. <li>      Barbara Kingsolver's <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em> -- because it's a perfect book:  glorious writing, characters as full and real as anyone you know, all those distinct, pitch-perfect voices, and a story that is big and sweeping and intensely intimate at the same time;    Annie Proulx's <em>The Shipping News</em> -- because I love to be transported to another world and her odd, magical prose is like no one else's. <li>      Elizabeth McCracken's <em>The Giant's House</em> -- because it's word for word as exquisitely written as any book ever (that first sentence kills me every time) and because it's like no other love story I've ever read. <li>      Haven Kimmel's <em>The Solace of Leaving Early</em> -- because every single character is alive and the prose sings and one of the characters says something about motherhood that's one of the truest things anyone's ever said;    Jane Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> -- because the dialogue is unmatched anywhere. <li>      Kent Haruf's <em>Plainsong </em>-- because it is so sparely beautiful and reflects such faith in the basic decency of people. <li>      Ann Patchett's <em>Bel Canto</em> -- because it is a soaring, luminous, breathtaking dream of a book.<p>    <strong>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?<br></strong>    Sadly, I can't listen to music while I write.  It's just too distracting.  But if I ever put together a personal favorites playlist, something I've never done, it would certainly include the following:  Ella Fitzgerald singing Gershwin and Cole Porter, Sarah Vaughan singing Gershwin and Cole Porter, early Elvis Costello, Radiohead, an old Austin band called The Reivers, Chet Baker singing, Lucinda Williams, REM, The Shins, Phantom Planet, U2.<p>        <strong>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?<br></strong>    I love to give books like the ones I mention above, ones that did not get a lot of press or hunker down on the Times list for weeks, but that are revelations.  I don't think so much about the book as an object, so paperbacks work for me.  But it's a wonderful feeling to give someone a book that you love; it's like giving them a little world.<p>       <strong>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?<br></strong>    I'm really very boring in that regard.  No rituals.  My writing time is so precious and hard-won that I try to get immersed fast, usually by reading pages from the day before.  My office and desk are distinctly unbeautiful, a big old computer surrounded by heaps of papers and books.  I have pictures of my kids on the bulletin board because I can really start to miss them when I'm working. <p>           <strong>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?<br></strong>    As a novelist, I've been incredibly lucky, and most of that luck has to do with finding-or being found by-first my agent, then my editor.  I count them both as true friends; I trust them absolutely; and they are wildly good at their jobs.  I walk around in a constant, shining cloud of gratitude for them.  My agent, Jen Carlson, found me through an essay I'd contributed to a book she represented.  While I'd been a poet forever, at the time she contacted me, I happened to have about 65 pages of what would become <em>Love Walked In</em>.  I sent them to her, we met in New York and instantly felt as though we'd known each other for years.  I'd send her chunks of the novel as I wrote (she's such a gifted reader and editor), and when the book was finished, she took it out.  It went to auction and ended up in the hands of Laurie Chittenden for which I count my lucky stars.  So, no horror stories, but I would not say that I'm an overnight success by any means!  As I said, I was a poet for years and years (had never written even a short story before I wrote the first book), and my poems got rejected by many, many wonderful literary magazines. <p>           <strong>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?<br></strong>    While you're writing, forget about everything but the characters and the story and the language.  Don't try to second guess the fiction market or please an agent or try to fill a niche or think ahead to selling film rights or getting on the bestseller lists.  The fact is that even publishers get surprised all the time by what sells and what doesn't; what's a critical success and what isn't.  You can't write to order, and you shouldn't even try. <p>    Listen to the book; trust your characters and your instincts; don't try to micromanage.  Let the book grow organically.  You need to believe in your book the whole way through because once the manuscript is out in the world, and I'm talking about even after it's with a publisher and even after it's published, you're likely to get a lot of feedback on it.  There will be good advice and bad advice; there might be people who hate your book.  Figure out what you can use, but stand by your vision.  These words are invisibly tattooed on my arm:  Be True to Your Book.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers</b><br>Bogart and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy.  Their romances and their films have stirred the hearts and minds of movie buffs for decades and have set the bar high.  But movies aren't like life�or are they?  Marisa de los Santos' debut novel is a delicious modern-day fairy tale come true that's not only a captivating love story but a heartfelt homage to some of our favorite films, too. <br><br>  

Cornelia Brown is a 30-ish caf� manager: underemployed, alone, and hardly expecting to star in her own version of <i>The Philadelphia Story.</i>  Yet that, remarkably, is just what happens when Martin Grace walks through the door.  For a woman who measures life in terms of her favorite movie moments, this has Hollywood written all over it.  Meanwhile, across town, young Clare Hobbes is living a nightmare.  Forced to fend for herself when her unstable mother suffers a breakdown, and unable to convince her estranged father to respond to her pleas for help, she is alone and terrified. Oh, the drama!  
<br><br>
So put your feet up, shoo the dog off the couch, and prepare for an extraordinary ride to a world where Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart set the standard; where an appealing, big-hearted heroine finally learns all about love; and happily-ever-after, though perhaps with some surprises, is finally given its due.
(<i>Spring 2006 Selection</i>)</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>A tribute to classic film and true romance, Love Walked In tells the story of two women � one older, one younger � and the unexpected ways in which their lives are forever changed by chance.<P>For thirty-one-year old Cornelia Brown, life is a series of movie moments, and "Jimmy Stewart is always and indisputably the best man in the world, unless Cary Grant should happen to show up." So imagine Cornelia's delight when her very own Cary Grant walks through the door of the hip Philadelphia caf&eacute; she manages. Handsome and debonair, Martin Grace sweeps Cornelia off her feet, becoming Cary Grant to Cornelia's Katharine Hepburn, Clark Gable to her Joan Crawford. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, eleven-year-old Clare Hobbes must learn to fend for herself after her increasingly unstable mother has a breakdown and disappears. With no one to turn to, Clare seeks out her estranged father, and when the two of them show up at Cornelia's caf&eacute;, the lives of Cornelia and Clare are changed in drastic and unexpected ways. A cinematic and heartfelt debut that pays homage to the classic Cary Grant/Katharine Hepburn romantic comedy <I>The Philadelphia Story</I>, <I>Love Walked In</I> is sure to win over critics and readers of contemporary fiction.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Susan Adams</h3><p><i>Love Walked In</i> by Marisa de los Santos, is the kind of book that makes you want to hunker down on a chilly day in a comfy chair and read straight through 'til dark. The beginning is light, entertaining and inviting, the middle grows more serious, and then, toward the end, the violins really start to play in this poignant, heart-tugging story about a single woman and a little girl who develop an unlikely bond.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Philadelphia cafe manager Cornelia Brown drifts effortlessly  through her unattached life, unapologetic for idealizing romance  and breathlessly recommending The Philadelphia Story-to the  reader and everyone else. Eleven-year-old Clare is a child of  divorce whose mother, a successful party planner, is quickly  going to pieces. In alternating chapters of Cornelia's first  person and Clare's free and direct third, poet de los Santos,  making her novel debut, tells the story of their finding each  other. That Cornelia, early on, immediately falls for Cary Grant  doppelganger Martin Grace is no surprise; his relation to Clare,  revealed a third of the way in, isn't really either. As she  discovers maternal instincts she wasn't sure she had, Cornelia  works up the courage to face her own feelings for Clare with  honesty. As Martin exits, Cornelia's childhood friend Teo  enters, but neither makes much impact, and Clare's rather  serious issues get reduced to Clare-did-this, Clare-thought-that  episodes. The two main characters exist for one purpose: to  enact a cross-generational, strong-but-vulnerable-and-loving,  screenplay-ready femininity. Chick lit? You bet: with rights  sold in at least eight countries, and, indeed, to  Paramount-Sarah Jessica Parker will star and coproduce with  Sideways's Michael London. The book is fine, but for this  property, it's a case of waiting for Carrie to walk in. (Jan.)    Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.

								Children's Literature</h3><p>Cornelia would be the first to admit that she has turned her life into a series of movie moments. She moved to Philadelphia because she fell in love with a movie&#151;<I>The Philadelphia Story</I>&#151;and there she waits for her leading man. When Martin, the handsome stranger in a perfectly cut suit, opens the door of the coffee shop Cornelia manages, she is all too ready to be swept off her feet and into the arms of her Cary Grant, her Clark Gable, her Jimmy Stewart. But is Martin her real love? Will he be the one to transform her fantasies into reality? Across town, eleven-year-old Clara struggles to hold her life together as her mother becomes increasingly unstable. When her mother disappears, abandoning Clara on the side of a road, Clara turns to her estranged father for help. And when Clara and her father show up on Cornelia's doorstep, Clara's and Cornelia's lives are changed forever. This is a novel about love between men and women, friends and strangers, mothers and daughters. There are a few (very few) obscenities, and the intimate moments between some of the characters are discrete. A choice for older teenage girls although many&#151;if not most&#151;will not be familiar with the leading men and the romantic movies of the past. 2006, Penguin,  Ages 15 up.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Cornelia is a sprightly little thing who's stuck in a rut  managing a coffee shop and watching her beloved film classics in  her spare time. Then, right out of the movies, "love walked in,"  looking just like a modern-day incarnation of Cary Grant. Martin  seems to be perfect for Cornelia, until she meets his  ten-year-old daughter, Clare, whom he had failed to mention.  When Cornelia learns that Clare's mother, Martin's ex-wife, has  disappeared, she steps right into the situation. Narrated by  Cornelia and Claire in alternating chapters, this is the story  of how two lives intersect and a great relationship blooms from  an unexpected seed. Poet de los Santos's debut is a light, sweet  read with just a bit of substance underneath. Sarah Jessica  Parker is slated to star and coproduce the film version with  Sideways producer Michael London, and it seems like a good  match. This may be one of those books that will be even better  on the big screen. Recommended. [See Prepub Alert, LJ  8/05.]-Beth Gibbs, Davidson, NC   Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Two heroines, Clare Martin and Cornelia Brown, discover the power of friendship and the meaning of love in this remarkable tale. De los Santos crafts two irresistible characters in her debut novel. First we meet Cornelia, a hopeless romantic, addicted to classic films in which dashing men like Carey Grant bedazzle glamorous leading ladies like Grace Kelly. Cornelia is a 30-something underachiever whiling her time away as the manager of a Philadelphia coffee shop. While she neglects her interior life, Cornelia keeps her intellect sharp by engaging in clever repartee with the eccentrics who patronize Cafe Dora. But everything changes when Martin Grace strolls through the cafe's door. Martin is matinee-idol perfect-the witty banter, the impeccable clothes, the air of mystery. Cornelia is hooked. The relationship whizzes along, bringing Cornelia an offer of marriage. But before she gets to live happily ever after, Cornelia delves deeper into her feelings for Martin. Is she willing to settle for a safe and reliable relationship with a weak physical and emotional connection? Maybe chemistry only exists on movie screens and sparks don't fly for mere mortals. As Cornelia struggles to find her romantic bearings, our other heroine is facing tragedy. Clare, a tenderhearted pre-teen, is devastated when her mother experiences a mental breakdown and abandons Clare during the holidays. Through serendipity, Clare and Cornelia cross paths at the cafe, and the author deftly interweaves their stories. These two fragile souls instinctively cling to one another and share their dreams. Clare longs for a safe and secure home life and a reunion with her mother; Cornelia hopes to create a family of her own andfind love. De los Santos's writing engages throughout this powerful story. It's impossible not to cheer for these characters as they search for happiness. A timeless gem. Film rights to Paramount, with Sarah Jessica Parker to star and, with Michael London, co-produce

<strong>Q:</strong>  Was the transition from writing poetry to writing a novel easy?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> I've always been a reader of novels.  Honestly, even when I wrote poetry exclusively, when it came to reading, novels were what I loved most and, more than any other form of literature, novels are what shaped-and what continue to shape-my personality in deep, lasting ways.  The simple truth is that I wrote poems because I knew how to write poems and I didn't write novels because I didn't know how and because I didn't have a story to tell.  Maybe no one knows how to write "poetry" or "fiction"; maybe one only knows how to write specific poems and specific novels.  Certainly, until I had a story to tell and until I had characters whose voices I could hear very distinctly, I had no idea how to begin to write a novel.  And then one day I found that I had characters and the shadowy outlines of a plot living in my head.
<p></p>
That's part of the story.  The other part is that after my first child was born-he's six now-something shifted.  I'm not sure why, but while I could still concentrate on writing and still wanted to write, something was different.  It became increasingly difficult for me to summon the kind of concentration-not level or quality, but kind-I needed to write poems.  I'm a writer, though; I needed to write something.  So when Cornelia and Clare showed up in my imagination with their pieces of plot, I had some idea of what to do with them!
<p></p>

<strong>Q:</strong> Is any of Love Walked In based at all on your own family life?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> My mother has manic-depressive illness, also called bipolar disorder.  I've written poems about her illness and about the breakdown she had when I was fourteen, which bears some resemblance to the extended breakdown Clare's mother has in Love Walked In.  At least some of Clare's story rose out of those personal experiences.
<p></p>
As for Cornelia, she came from so many sources and experiences that I couldn't really describe them.  She just sort of began to live as a voice in my head, a certain cadence of speech, and a certain kind of wit.  Cornelia just was, and once she was, she began to do.
<p></p>


<strong>Q:</strong> Love Walked In carries the theme that love comes in many different forms.  Can you elaborate?  <br>
<strong>A:</strong> Love is untidy and surprising and inconsiderate.  It blindsides you, more often than not.  Not just romantic love, but all love.  You fall in love with your oldest friend.  You meet the man you think is made for you and end up loving his daughter instead.  You go home one day only to discover that your family's love is far more complex than you'd ever understood.  Even when you anticipate the onset of love, it never takes quite the form you'd imagined it would.  Having children is a perfect example of this.  You're pregnant for nine months, falling more in love every minute, waiting for the baby, and then, he's born, and you realize what boundless means; you realize that you weren't even close to being prepared.  All those movies in which people tell other people, "I would die for you"?  You realize that there's nothing special about that.  It's an automatic, the bare minimum.  
<p></p>
In Love Walked In, Cornelia says, "But getting what you love?  Having what you love love you back?  Oh, my friend, it's miracle, your one tiny life's head-on collision with divinity."  And she's right.  Whether it's the love of a mother, a child, a friend, a lover, love's IT.  Our big chance.  In love, we rub shoulders with the eternal.
<p></p>

<strong>Q:</strong> 	You make many references to classic films in Love Walked In. Are you a movie buff?<br>
<strong>A:</strong>	I love classic movies, all kinds, but the romantic comedies from the 1930s and 1940s are my favorite.  I just love them; the elegance, the dialogue, the dazzling wit.  They're part of who I am.  As far as leading men go, I have to agree with Cornelia that Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart are tops, but I'm probably more intrigued by the women.  I love how smart they are, how bright and changeable their faces are.  I love their talk.  Katharine Hepburn, of course.  She's marvelous.  And Irene Dunne, for sure.  Love Affair, My Favorite Wife, The Awful Truth.  She's just perfection.  Both of those actresses have that balance of lightness and gravitas, charm and vulnerability; both of them know how to move their bodies and how to turn up a corner of their mouths at just the right moments.  Rosalind Russell, too.  Her unbelievable ability to fast-talk; she's so funny and smart.  Jean Arthur.  Barbara Stanwyck.  Later, Audrey Hepburn.  I could go on and on.
<p></p>
<strong>Q:</strong> 	Your novel is set mostly in Philadelphia.  Do you have a connection to that city?  <br>
<strong>A:</strong> 	Yes.  My family and I have lived in Wilmington, Delaware for about two and a half years, but before that, we lived in Philadelphia for five years.  I loved it.  We lived in a row house right in the thick of things, just off the Avenue of the Arts, and it was just a vibrant, varied life.  It was the first place I lived as an adult that felt like home to me, maybe because we'd chosen it.  We didn't live there because we were students, and we didn't even work there.  We commuted to Delaware on the train for work.  Philadelphia has a distinct character, a real heartbeat, and we had the kind of intimacy with it you can only get by living in a place and walking all over it every day.  After we had two kids, the commute started to wear on us, so we moved.  We're happy where we are now, but I can definitely envision a return to Philly.  Rittenhouse Square is still one of my favorite places in the world.
<p></p>
<strong>Q:</strong> What are some books you love?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> 	E.M. Forster's Howard's End and A Room With a View; Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God; Jane Austen's Emma and Pride and Prejudice; George Eliot's Middlemarch; Everything by Barbara Kingsolver, especially The Poisonwood Bible and Animal Dreams; Charles Baxter's The Feast of Love; Elizabeth McCracken's The Giant's House; Ann Patchett's The Magician's Assistant; Justin Cronin's The Summer Guest; Annie Proulx's The Shipping News; Nick Hornby's About a Boy; A.S. Byatt's Possession; "The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" by Michael Chabon
<p></p>
<strong>Q:</strong>  What are you working on next?<br>	
<strong>A:</strong> 	I'm writing a second novel, a sort of follow-up to the first.  Cornelia is one of three main characters, and a few other characters from Love Walked In show up, including, eventually, Clare.  But it's very much its own novel, a stand-alone story with its own mood, its own climate.  Certainly, I didn't set out to write a sequel; in fact, it struck me as rather illogical to write a sequel to a book that hadn't come out yet.  But Cornelia was still right there, a voice in my head, insistent, and I knew I wasn't finished with her yet.  Or, more accurately, she wasn't finished with me!  In this book, she's married and has just moved to the suburbs.  The two other main characters are a woman named Piper, who is, in many ways, the anti-Cornelia, and a thirteen-year-old spooky-smart boy named Dev.<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><B>1<BR> Cornelia</B> <BR><BR> My life-my real life-started when a man walked into it, a handsome stranger in a perfectly cut suit, and, yes, I know how that sounds. My friend Linny would snort and convey the kind of multipronged disgust I rely on her to convey. One prong of feminist disgust at the whole idea of a man changing a woman's life, even though, as things turned out, the man himself was more the harbinger of change than the change itself. Another prong of disgust for the inaccuracy of saying my life began after thirty-one years of living it. And the final prong being a kind of general disgust for the way people turn moments in their lives into movie moments.<P> I do this more than I should, I'll give her that, but there was something backlit and sudden about his walking through the door of the caf&eacute; I managed. If the floor had been bare and not covered with tables, chairs, people, and dogs, the autumnal late-morning sun would have slung his narrow shadow dramatically across the floor in a real Orson Welles shot. But Linny can jab me with her three-pronged disgust fork all she wants, and I'd still say that my life started on that October morning when a man walked through the door. <P> It was an ordinary day-palpably ordinary, if that makes any sense, like it was asserting its smooth usualness. A Saturday, loud, smoke already piling up and hovering like weather over me and the customers in Caf&eacute; Dora. I sat where I always sat when I wasn't waiting on someone-on a high stool behind the counter-and I watched Hayes and Jose play chess. Everyone said they were good players. They themselves said they were. "Not prodigy good," said Hayes. "Not Russian,Deep-freakin'-Blue-playing good. But hell." Hayes was from Texas and wrote the wine column for the Philadelphia Inquirer. He liked to swear in offbeat ways, liked to walk in, turn a chair around backward with a bang, and straddle it. <P> As I watched, Jose lifted his shaggy head, gave Hayes a liquid-eyed, sorrowful look, and moved a chess piece from one square to another. I don't know the game well, but whatever Jose had done, it must have been something, because Hayes tossed back his head and hooted, "Hot damn, boy! You pulled that one right out of your ass!" Hayes looked at me with a wry smile and a genial cowboy twinkle in his eye, and I lifted one corner of my mouth in a kind of rueful facial shrug. "What can you do?" my face said. <P> But don't get attached to Hayes. As he was already in the room, he's obviously not the man who walked into it bearing the new life on his shoulders, and he doesn't finally figure into this story much. Not sure why I started with Hayes, except that in lots of ways he's a neat little embodiment of the old life&#58; a self-invented, smartish, semialluring wine snob disguised as a cowboy, not un- nice, with fairly amusing comments tripping off his tongue and probably a real person under there somewhere, but possibly not. In college, I read Piers Plowman in which this man Will goes on a journey and runs into characters like Holy Church and Gluttony. Think of Hayes as a character like that&#58; Typical-Denizen-of-Cornelia's-Old-Life. I've always found allegories kind of comforting. When you encounter people named Liar and Abstinence, you might not be crazy about them, but you know exactly what you're getting into. <P> Another regular, Phaedra, made her entrance, all blowsy auburn curls, leather pants, and nursing-mother breasts, and tugging a giant black pram behind her-one of those English nanny prams with high, white rubber tires. Five people jumped up and nearly cracked one another's skulls trying to hold the door open for her. Phaedra directed a beseeching look at the couple sitting at the table nearest the door, a look that turned out to be unnecessary. The man and woman were already hustling up their cappuccinos, jackets, camera bags, and backpacks on metal frames, not minding a bit. <P> "Cornelia!" Phaedra sang at me across the room in just the sort of musical voice you'd expect to come out of her mouth. "Could you? Caf&eacute; au lait? Loads of sugar? And something sinful!" We don't have table service. Phaedra made a helpless, sighing gesture with her shoulders and her long hands, indicating her child, her exhaustion, the whole ancient weight of motherhood. Phaedra was a pain. But Allegra was a different story. Bearing the coffee and a croissant, I came out from behind my counter and made my zigzag way around tables and dogs for the sake of Phaedra's baby, Allegra. <P> And there she was, wrapped in a leopard-print blanket, just waking up. A blue-eyed, translucent, bewitching witch of a baby, fresh as new bread in that smoky room. Allegra resembled Phaedra, same white skin, same glorious Carole Lombard forehead, but with carrot-orange hair that flew out in all directions. I waited for the pang; the pang came. I never saw Allegra without wanting to touch her, specifically to sleep with her in the crook of my right arm. I put the croissant and the coffee in front of Phaedra, then cradled my elbows with my hands. Allegra was asleep and making nursing motions with her mouth because what else would babies dream about? <P> "Face it. You want one," said Phaedra. With effort, I shifted my gaze from gorgeous child to gorgeous pain-in-the-ass mother. "See that?" said Phaedra. "You had to literally drag your eyes away from her." Ouch, I thought, and then sat down to talk for a minute, Phaedra's misuse of the word "literally" having created a warm spot in my heart, tiny but large enough to prompt a five- minute conversation. <P> "How's business?" I asked. Phaedra was a jewelry designer. <P> "Not good. I'm starting to think people just don't get it," said Phaedra. Her signature pieces, or what would be her signature pieces if anyone bought and wore them, were made out of sea glass and platinum, a juxtaposition of the ordinary and extraordinary, Phaedra claimed, that forced one to rethink one's perceptions of "value" and "preciousness." Maybe people didn't get it. Or maybe they got it but didn't feel sufficiently moved to shell out eight hundred dollars for a bracelet made of old Heineken bottles. <P> Phaedra lifted her coffee to her lips, eyeing me brightly through the steam. "Cornelia, what if you wore some of the pieces in the caf&eacute;, just to generate in-ter-est?" Her tone suggested the idea had just popped into her head. In fact, this was the third time she'd asked. <P> "I can't wear jewelry at work," I said, not elaborating but rolling my eyes in a way I hoped suggested some unseen powers-that-be who hovered over me, forbidding jewelry. The truth was that I never wore jewelry anywhere, ever. I'm five feet tall and built like a preteen, eighty-five pounds soaking wet, as my father says, and my fear is that, given my smallness, jewelry will make me look like a geegaw or doodad, a spangly ornament to hang on a tree. It's a shame, too, because I adore it. Not so much Phaedra's kind-cool, angular objects-but serious jewels&#58; diamonds, cuffs and chokers, brooches like shooting stars, tiaras. Jean Harlow jewels, Irene Dunne on the ship in Love Affair. <P> Allegra stirred in her leopard-print nest, yawned, and shot out a fist. Phaedra lifted her onto her lap, instantly dipping her swan neck, dropping her face into the orange hair, breathing in her child's scent. An authentic gesture, automatic, unstudied. I felt prickles shoot down my arms. I touched a finger to Allegra's hand, and she gripped it hard and hung on. <P> "You should have one, you know," said Phaedra, harping, and this instantly got my hackles up, until I saw her face, which was something like kind. Phaedra was always a better person with Allegra in her arms. So I just trilled a little laugh and said, breezily, "Me with a baby. Can you imagine?" <P> "Of course, I can. Perfectly," said Phaedra. "And so can you." <P> While I resented her smug smile, and while I'd have died before admitting it to her, I had to admit to myself that she was at least partly right&#58; I couldn't imagine it perfectly, but I could imagine it. Had imagined it, in fact, more than once. But, every time, what brought me to my senses was my conviction that before a person dropped a new life into this world, she should probably get a real one herself. <P> The truth was, I was treading water and had been for some time. If you're wondering why a thirty- something woman who had gone to all the trouble of attending a university and slogging through medieval allegorical texts had risen no higher on the career food chain than caf&eacute; manager, I don't blame you. I wondered myself. And the best answer I'd come up with was that I hadn't figured out anything better-not yet. If I were to ever have a full-fledged vocation, as opposed to a half-assed avocation, I needed to love it and, in my experience, it isn't always easy to figure out what you love. You'd think it would be, but it isn't. Also, if you stay in it for any length of time, like anyplace else, a caf&eacute; becomes a world. <P> I felt suddenly weary, looking at Phaedra and Allegra and the shining black pram. And if a woman weighing less than ninety pounds can be said to heave herself, I heaved myself out of my seat and lugged myself back to my spot behind the bar. <P> All of which is meant to demonstrate the ordinariness of the day and how the ordinariness was even taking on shades of dreariness and futility. Because you have to understand what my life was like in the "before" in order to see just how much it changed in the "after." Ordinary, ordinary. Except that-and I honestly believe this, Linny's pooh-poohing of movie moments notwithstanding-just before, a minute before the caf&eacute; door opened one more time, the ordinary day turned itself up a notch, in preparation. <P> The light falling through the high, arched windows went from mellow to brilliant, turning the old copper of the espresso machine to pure gold. And the music-Sarah Vaughan, whom I worship, singing George and Ira, whom I worship-was suddenly floating and dipping like some kind of bird in the clear space above the cigarette smoke and chitchat. The coffee smelled sublime, the flowers I'd bought that morning pierced the air with their blueness, the coffee cups lost their chips and glowed eggshell-thin, and standing in my red sweater and vintage suede skirt, my boots solidly on the floor, I felt almost tall. <P> The door of Caf&eacute; Dora opened, and Cary Grant walked in. <BR><BR> If you haven't seen The Philadelphia Story, stop what you are doing, rent it, and watch it. It's probably overstating the point to say that until you watch it, you will have been living a partial and colorless life. However, it is definitely on the list of perfect things. You know what I mean, the list that includes the starry sky over the desert, grilled cheese sandwiches, The Great Gatsby, the Chrysler building, Ella Fitzgerald singing "It Don't Mean a Thing (If You Ain't Got That Swing)," white peonies, and those little sketches of hands by Leonardo da Vinci. <P> If you have seen it, then you know there's a moment when Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord steps from a poolside cabana. She's got a straight white dream of a dress hanging from her tiny collarbones, a dress fluted and precise as a Greek column but light and full of the motion of smoke. A paradox of a dress, a marriage of opposites that just makes your teeth hurt it's so exactly right. <P> I was fourteen when I first saw it. It was three days before Christmas, which in my family's house meant, means, and will always mean, Yuletide sensory overload&#58; every room stuffed to the gills with garland and holly, the whole place booming with Johnny Mathis, and a monstrosity of a tree towering in the living room, weighed down with ornaments of every description, including dozens defying description that my brothers, sister, and I had made in school over the years. <P> Fourteen was not a good year for me. I was the latest of late bloomers, of course, about two feet high and scrawny as a cat, still shopping in the children's department, profoundly allergic to every member of my family, and convinced that nothing could make me happy. <P> But then my grouchy channel-surfing landed me in the middle of a black-and-white heaven&#58; Tracy, the dress. <P> I was so struck, I forgot how to swallow and began to truly asphyxiate on a sip of 7-Up. And when, a little later, Tracy unfastened the belt from her willow waist and slipped her faultlessly formed self out of that faultlessly formed garment, I stood up and yelled, "Holy shit, that's her bathing suit cover-up!" which my father, who was sitting on the floor fastening-no joke-jingle bells to the collars of our cats, did not appreciate. <P> I turned every atom of myself over to the rest of the movie. People must've gone tearing through the room, because people always did go tearing through rooms, especially my brothers Cam and Toby, who were eight and nine at the time. But a volcano could have begun spewing molten rock inches away from me, and I would not have noticed. I sat. I watched. If a girl could sling a poem over her swimwear as though it were an old T-shirt, what else might be possible? <P> I slid my fingers over my face, feeling for Tracy's winged cheekbones. And when Dexter (Cary Grant) took Tracy to task, saying, "You'll never be a first-rate woman or a first-rate human being until you have some regard for human frailty," I recognized it as wisdom and wondered whether I had it, that kind of regard, and just how to get it if I didn't. <P> In college, I took a film studies class subtitled something like "Turning the Formula on Its Head" in which the professor talked about the trick The Philadelphia Story pulls off. It should never have worked&#58; creating a fantastic love scene between two characters whom you know are not in love with each other, getting you somehow to root for them wholeheartedly during the scene, but then to feel completely satisfied when they end up with other people. <P> Before you get the wrong impression, you should know that I'm not and never was one of those film people, the kind who argue into the wee hours about the auteur theory and whether Spielberg is the new Capra, or whether John Huston impacts, in unseen ways, every second of American life. I don't know from camera angles, and I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of pre-World War II German cinema, but I fell a little in love with the film professor when he looked upon us with shining eyes and proclaimed, "No, it should not work. But work it does!" because he was so passionate and right. <P> When I heard Mike (Jimmy Stewart) say to Tracy in that tender, marveling voice, "No, you're made out of flesh and blood. That's the blank, unholy surprise of it. You're the golden girl, Tracy," I clasped my hands under my pointy chin, prayed that she would run away with him, and swore to God that someday a man would say those words in that voice to me or else I would die. But then, at the movie's end, my father heard cheering and left water running in the sink to watch his lately distant, disaffected teenage daughter bang her fists on the arms of her chair and turn to him crying, "with a face as open as a flower" (my dad's own improbable words), saying breathlessly, "She's marrying Dexter, Daddy." <P> I'll admit it. I've always been more than a little proud of myself for having been fourteen and deeply benighted about almost everything, but having had the sense to recognize what is surely a universal truth&#58; Jimmy Stewart is always and indisputably the best man in the world, unless Cary Grant should happen to show up. <BR><BR> His name was Martin Grace. An excellent name, which, you may have noticed, shares all but three letters with "Cary Grant." Of course, if you're not a freak of nature, you probably didn't notice, and you'll be relieved to know that it didn't even spring to my mind right away. It was later, as I lay in bed that night, that I figured it out, mentally crossing out letters with an imaginary pencil, concentrating pretty hard, but sort of affecting an offhand, semi-interested attitude about it, cocking my head casually on the pillow, even though there was no one in the room to see me. <P> Truth be told, I'm a little superstitious about names. Back in college, I dated an enormous, blond, dumb fraternity boy from Baton Rouge with a voice like a foghorn purely on the strength of his being named William Powell, whom everyone knows from the Thin Man movies, but who is even better in Libeled Lady and is one of those men whose handsomeness you believe in completely even though you know it doesn't exist. <P> My mother met the boy and knew instantly what I was up to. "Your nose looks like Myrna Loy's," she'd said. "Be satisfied with that." Even so, I didn't ditch Bill until a few nights later when I stood in his Georgian-mansion-turned-dank-cave of a frat house and watched Bill dancing shirtless on a tabletop, his bare, unfortunate belly pulsating like an anguished jellyfish. The bellyfish pulsated, and William Powell, with a delicate shrug, chose that moment to detach himself from Bill forever and slip out into the honeysuckle-scented night. <P> Slippery things, names. Still&#58; Martin Grace. Good. Very good. <P> He'd stood dark-eyed and half-smiling in the doorway. Tall. Suit, hair, jawline all flawlessly cut. "Imperially slim," is the phrase that jumped out of my fourth-grade reading book into my head. But the man in that poem ended up shooting himself, I remembered later, while this man, my man, clearly had only a seamless, sophisticated, well-shod life ahead of him. I'm exaggerating, but not much, when I say that as he walked to the counter-walked to me-the dogs, chess players, prams, etcetera parted before him like the Red Sea. <P> "Hello," he said, and his voice wasn't mellifluous or stentorian or melting or sonorous but was nonetheless unmistakably leading-man. As you knew he would, he had a dimple in his chin, and for a wild second or two I considered touching it and asking him how he shaved in there, because if you're going to rip someone off it might as well be Audrey Hepburn. I didn't, but I distinctly felt the dimple impress itself upon my unconscious, if such a thing is possible. <P> "Hi" is what I said. <P> "A coffee, please. Black." And you could just tell that's really what he liked and didn't sense a self- conscious backstory involving a Marlboro Man masculinity obsession trailing like a long, stupid tail behind the request. <P> When I handed him his coffee, I let my hand linger on it an extra beat, so that it was still there when he reached for it. I like to pretend to myself that the cup became a little conduit and that our electricity shook it. Anyway, coffee spilled on my hand and I yelped and pressed it to my mouth like a two-year-old. <P> He looked at me with real concern and said, "I should be kept in a cage." <P> "Occupational hazard." I shrugged. "It's fine." <P> "It's fine? Really? Because if it's not, you have to tell me so I can go drown myself in the Delaware." <P> "Don't be silly," I said. "The Schuykill's closer." <P> "The Delaware's deeper. I don't have the guts to drown myself in shallow water, even for you." <P> Even for you, even for you! my heart sang. <P> "Except," he said. <P> "Except what?" I snapped, snappily. <P> "Except it'll have to be the Thames. I leave for London in two hours." <P> This might not sound so earth-shattering to you, so fabulously clever or romantic, but trust me when I tell you that it was. Right from the start, we just had a cadence, an intuitive rhythm that I might possibly compare to the sixth sense that jazz musicians sometimes have when they're playing together if I knew the first thing about jazz. You've seen Tracy-Hepburn movies, yes? It was the conversation I'd been waiting for all my life. <P> And it kept up, that back-and-forth. He talked about his business trip-four days in London, finance something or other-and about fog, how the thing of it was it really was foggy in London. <P> I felt taut and tingly and flushed, as though I were wearing a new skin, but I wasn't exactly nervous. Miraculously, I was up to the challenge of meeting this man, perfect as he was. I was "on." I even had the presence of mind, in the presence of Martin Grace, to continue doing my job, which was fortunate because that's the way life is, isn't it? Even as you and the Embodiment-of- All-Your-Hopes stand percolating your own little weather system, two teenaged boys with skateboards under their arms are bound to walk up, splash a pile of dimes onto the counter, and order triple mocha lattes. And usually, it's not when your eyes are locked with the black-lashed, chocolate-colored stunners the dream man apparently carries around on his face all day as though they were ordinary eyes, but when you're busy jittering the dimes into the cash register that you'll hear him say, "Why don't you come with me?" <P> Because he said that, Martin Grace did. To me. <P> I heard it again, an eerily precise aural memory, as I lay in bed that night, turning over the all-but- three-letters/Cary Grant idea for the first of you don't even want to know how many times. At the sound of Martin's voice in my head, I sat up, got up, walked over to the window, my white nightgown floating like a ghost around me, and sat in the chair I'd covered last spring with figured, lead-heavy green silk that had once been a monster of a fifties ball gown hanging in a resale shop in Buena (pronounced Byoona) Vista, Virginia. I cranked open my third-floor casement window, looked at Philadelphia-my piece of it-and let my affection for it lift lightly off of me like scent from a flower and drift out into the cool air. Spruce Street&#58; cars and lights; the synagogue on the corner; the hustlers in front of it, male and heartbreakingly young. I felt the two tugs I always felt when I looked at those boys&#58; the tug toward wanting the cars to stop, the tug toward wanting them not to stop. <P> I could be in London right now, I thought. Right now, lying back on unfamiliarly English pillows with Martin Grace beside me. <P> Why I wasn't is a long story-so long that it probably isn't a story at all. It's probably just the way I am. But the next thing I said, a major-league clunker, the conversational equivalent of falling on my face, pretty much sums it up. <P> I stood there in tumult, weighing common sense against desire, trepidation against adventure, caution against impulse, while inwardly banging my head against the wall because, tumult or no tumult, my answer was a foregone conclusion&#58; <P> "I want to, but I can't. My mother wouldn't like it." <P> "So we'll leave her home this time. She can come on the Paris trip." <P> As I sat at my window replaying this conversation, lonely, nightgowned, face burning, but still somehow happy, I watched a helicopter in the distance drop its beam of searchlight and swing it slowly back and forth. I imagined a couple in evening dress doing a song-and-dance number in the street below, the woman's skirt blooming like a white carnation as she spun. <P> Then I tried to imagine a world in which my mother would accompany me and my older (by maybe fifteen years?) lover to Paris, and blew out a single, sarcastic, "Ha!" <P> My mother alphabetizes her spice rack, wears Tretorn sneakers, and never puts eleven items on the ten-item express grocery counter, ever. She is a garden club president, and I mean that both literally and figuratively. On the outside, my life doesn't look much like hers; I've made sure of that. But the truth is that I am my mother's daughter, literally, figuratively, forever. <P> Still, I made sure Martin Grace did not walk out the door without my number. I leaned over, folded back his lapel, and placed it in his inside breast pocket myself. Then, I gave him a look so worthy of Veronica Lake, I could almost feel my nonexistent blond tresses falling over one eye.
<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><html><body> <h1><font size="+3"> Love Walked In </font></h1><hr noshade size="1"><font size="+1"><i> By Marise de los Santos </i></font></hr><h4><i> Dutton Adult </i></h4><font size=-1><i> ISBN: 0-525-94917-8 </i></font><br><hr noshade size='1'></hr> <br><h3> Chapter One </h3> <i>Cornelia</i> <p> My life-my real life-started when a man walked into it, a handsome stranger in a perfectly cut suit, and, yes, I know how that sounds. My friend Linny would snort and convey the kind of multipronged disgust I rely on her to convey. One prong of feminist disgust at the whole idea of a man changing a woman's life, even though, as things turned out, the man himself was more the harbinger of change than the change itself. Another prong of disgust for the inaccuracy of saying my life began after thirty-one years of living it. And the final prong being a kind of general disgust for the way people turn moments in their lives into movie moments. <p> I do this more than I should, I'll give her that, but there was something backlit and sudden about his walking through the door of the cafe I managed. If the floor had been bare and not covered with tables, chairs, people, and dogs, the autumnal late-morning sun would have slung his narrow shadow dramatically across the floor in a real Orson Welles shot. But Linny can jab me with her three-pronged disgust fork all she wants, and I'd still say that my life started on that October morning when a man walked through the door. <p> It was an ordinary day-palpably ordinary, if that makes any sense, like it was asserting its smooth usualness. A Saturday, loud, smoke already piling up and hovering like weather over me and the customers in Cafe Dora. I sat where I always sat when I wasn't waiting on someone-on a high stool behind the counter-and I watched Hayes and Jose play chess. Everyone said they were good players. They themselves said they were. "Not prodigy good," said Hayes. "Not Russian, Deep-freakin'-Blue-playing good. But hell." Hayes was from Texas and wrote the wine column for the Philadelphia Inquirer. He liked to swear in offbeat ways, liked to walk in, turn a chair around backward with a bang, and straddle it. <p> As I watched, Jose lifted his shaggy head, gave Hayes a liquid-eyed, sorrowful look, and moved a chess piece from one square to another. I don't know the game well, but whatever Jose had done, it must have been something, because Hayes tossed back his head and hooted, "Hot damn, boy! You pulled that one right out of your ass!" Hayes looked at me with a wry smile and a genial cowboy twinkle in his eye, and I lifted one corner of my mouth in a kind of rueful facial shrug. "What can you do?" my face said. <p> But don't get attached to Hayes. As he was already in the room, he's obviously not the man who walked into it bearing the new life on his shoulders, and he doesn't finally figure into this story much. Not sure why I started with Hayes, except that in lots of ways he's a neat little embodiment of the old life: a self-invented, smartish, semialluring wine snob disguised as a cowboy, not un- nice, with fairly amusing comments tripping off his tongue and probably a real person under there somewhere, but possibly not. In college, I read Piers Plowman in which this man Will goes on a journey and runs into characters like Holy Church and Gluttony. Think of Hayes as a character like that: Typical-Denizen-of-Cornelia's-Old-Life. I've always found allegories kind of comforting. When you encounter people named Liar and Abstinence, you might not be crazy about them, but you know exactly what you're getting into. <p> Another regular, Phaedra, made her entrance, all blowsy auburn curls, leather pants, and nursing-mother breasts, and tugging a giant black pram behind her-one of those English nanny prams with high, white rubber tires. Five people jumped up and nearly cracked one another's skulls trying to hold the door open for her. Phaedra directed a beseeching look at the couple sitting at the table nearest the door, a look that turned out to be unnecessary. The man and woman were already hustling up their cappuccinos, jackets, camera bags, and backpacks on metal frames, not minding a bit. <p> "Cornelia!" Phaedra sang at me across the room in just the sort of musical voice you'd expect to come out of her mouth. "Could you? Cafe au lait? Loads of sugar? And something sinful!" We don't have table service. Phaedra made a helpless, sighing gesture with her shoulders and her long hands, indicating her child, her exhaustion, the whole ancient weight of motherhood. Phaedra was a pain. But Allegra was a different story. Bearing the coffee and a croissant, I came out from behind my counter and made my zigzag way around tables and dogs for the sake of Phaedra's baby, Allegra. <p> And there she was, wrapped in a leopard-print blanket, just waking up. A blue-eyed, translucent, bewitching witch of a baby, fresh as new bread in that smoky room. Allegra resembled Phaedra, same white skin, same glorious Carole Lombard forehead, but with carrot-orange hair that flew out in all directions. I waited for the pang; the pang came. I never saw Allegra without wanting to touch her, specifically to sleep with her in the crook of my right arm. I put the croissant and the coffee in front of Phaedra, then cradled my elbows with my hands. Allegra was asleep and making nursing motions with her mouth because what else would babies dream about? <p> "Face it. You want one," said Phaedra. With effort, I shifted my gaze from gorgeous child to gorgeous pain-in-the-ass mother. "See that?" said Phaedra. "You had to literally drag your eyes away from her." Ouch, I thought, and then sat down to talk for a minute, Phaedra's misuse of the word "literally" having created a warm spot in my heart, tiny but large enough to prompt a five- minute conversation. <p> "How's business?" I asked. Phaedra was a jewelry designer. <p> "Not good. I'm starting to think people just don't get it," said Phaedra. Her signature pieces, or what would be her signature pieces if anyone bought and wore them, were made out of sea glass and platinum, a juxtaposition of the ordinary and extraordinary, Phaedra claimed, that forced one to rethink one's perceptions of "value" and "preciousness." Maybe people didn't get it. Or maybe they got it but didn't feel sufficiently moved to shell out eight hundred dollars for a bracelet made of old Heineken bottles. <p> Phaedra lifted her coffee to her lips, eyeing me brightly through the steam. "Cornelia, what if you wore some of the pieces in the cafe, just to generate interest?" Her tone suggested the idea had just popped into her head. In fact, this was the third time she'd asked. <p> "I can't wear jewelry at work," I said, not elaborating but rolling my eyes in a way I hoped suggested some unseen powers-that-be who hovered over me, forbidding jewelry. The truth was that I never wore jewelry anywhere, ever. I'm five feet tall and built like a preteen, eighty-five pounds soaking wet, as my father says, and my fear is that, given my smallness, jewelry will make me look like a geegaw or doodad, a spangly ornament to hang on a tree. It's a shame, too, because I adore it. Not so much Phaedra's kind-cool, angular objects-but serious jewels: diamonds, cuffs and chokers, brooches like shooting stars, tiaras. Jean Harlow jewels, Irene Dunne on the ship in Love Affair. <p> Allegra stirred in her leopard-print nest, yawned, and shot out a fist. Phaedra lifted her onto her lap, instantly dipping her swan neck, dropping her face into the orange hair, breathing in her child's scent. An authentic gesture, automatic, unstudied. I felt prickles shoot down my arms. I touched a finger to Allegra's hand, and she gripped it hard and hung on. <p> "You should have one, you know," said Phaedra, harping, and this instantly got my hackles up, until I saw her face, which was something like kind. Phaedra was always a better person with Allegra in her arms. So I just trilled a little laugh and said, breezily, "Me with a baby. Can you imagine?" <p> "Of course, I can. Perfectly," said Phaedra. "And so can you." <p> While I resented her smug smile, and while I'd have died before admitting it to her, I had to admit to myself that she was at least partly right: I couldn't imagine it perfectly, but I could imagine it. Had imagined it, in fact, more than once. But, every time, what brought me to my senses was my conviction that before a person dropped a new life into this world, she should probably get a real one herself. <p> The truth was, I was treading water and had been for some time. If you're wondering why a thirty-something woman who had gone to all the trouble of attending a university and slogging through medieval allegorical texts had risen no higher on the career food chain than cafe manager, I don't blame you.

Also, if you stay in it for any length of time, like anyplace else, a cafe becomes a world. <p> I felt suddenly weary, looking at Phaedra and Allegra and the shining black pram. And if a woman weighing less than ninety pounds can be said to heave herself, I heaved myself out of my seat and lugged myself back to my spot behind the bar. <p> All of which is meant to demonstrate the ordinariness of the day and how the ordinariness was even taking on shades of dreariness and futility.

It should never have worked: creating a fantastic love scene between two characters whom you know are not in love with each other, getting you somehow to root for them wholeheartedly during the scene, but then to feel completely satisfied when they end up with other people. <p> Before you get the wrong impression, you should know that I'm not and never was one of those film people, the kind who argue into the wee hours about the auteur theory and whether Spielberg is the new Capra, or whether John Huston impacts, in unseen ways, every second of American life. I don't know from camera angles, and I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of pre-World War II German cinema, but I fell a little in love with the film professor when he looked upon us with shining eyes and proclaimed, "No, it should not work. But work it does!" because he was so passionate and right. <p> When I heard Mike (Jimmy Stewart) say to Tracy in that tender, marveling voice, "No, you're made out of flesh and blood. That's the blank, unholy surprise of it. You're the golden girl, Tracy," I clasped my hands under my pointy chin, prayed that she would run away with him, and swore to God that someday a man would say those words in that voice to me or else I would die. But then, at the movie's end, my father heard cheering and left water running in the sink to watch his lately distant, disaffected teenage daughter bang her fists on the arms of her chair and turn to him crying, "with a face as open as a flower" (my dad's own improbable words), saying breathlessly, "She's marrying Dexter, Daddy." <p> I'll admit it. I've always been more than a little proud of myself for having been fourteen and deeply benighted about almost everything, but having had the sense to recognize what is surely a universal truth: Jimmy Stewart is always and indisputably the best man in the world, unless Cary Grant should happen to show up. <p> <p> His name was Martin Grace. An excellent name, which, you may have noticed, shares all but three letters with "Cary Grant." Of course, if you're not a freak of nature, you probably didn't notice, and you'll be relieved to know that it didn't even spring to my mind right away. It was later, as I lay in bed that night, that I figured it out, mentally crossing out letters with an imaginary pencil, concentrating pretty hard, but sort of affecting an offhand, semi-interested attitude about it, cocking my head casually on the pillow, even though there was no one in the room to see me. <p> Truth be told, I'm a little superstitious about names. Back in college, I dated an enormous, blond, dumb fraternity boy from Baton Rouge with a voice like a foghorn purely on the strength of his being named William Powell, whom everyone knows from the Thin Man movies, but who is even better in Libeled Lady and is one of those men whose handsomeness you believe in completely even though you know it doesn't exist. <p> My mother met the boy and knew instantly what I was up to. "Your nose looks like Myrna Loy's," she'd said. "Be satisfied with that." Even so, I didn't ditch Bill until a few nights later when I stood in his Georgian-mansion-turned-dank-cave of a frat house and watched Bill dancing shirtless on a tabletop, his bare, unfortunate belly pulsating like an anguished jellyfish. The bellyfish pulsated, and William Powell, with a delicate shrug, chose that moment to detach himself from Bill forever and slip out into the honeysuckle-scented night. <p> Slippery things, names. Still: Martin Grace. Good. Very good. <p> <i>(Continues...)</i> <p> <p> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <i>Love Walked In</i> by <i>Marise de los Santos</i> Excerpted by permission. <br> All rights reserved.
