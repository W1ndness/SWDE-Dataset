What's the cause? Do they succumb to nerves from external expectations? Do they secretly feel unworthy? Are our expectations as readers unreasonable? Have they merely been sport for the gods?<br /><br /><em>The Time Traveler's Wife, </em>Audrey Niffenegger's first book, was Cinderella at the ball -- a book that got published without a literary agent behind it, a popular success that was a critical one too. Its distinctive (and, I assume from Niffenegger's acknowledgments, long-steeped) flavor completely eluded the dumb movie made from it. Describing the novel as blending fantasy, science fiction, romance, mild philosophy, and epistolary traditions is technically accurate, but fails to capture its unusual charm: its balance of inevitability and suspense, the importance of conversations both humorous and tersely poignant, the cultural riffs and bookish background of Chicago in the '80s and '90s, the bubble of optimism that buoys it up even in the face of death and decay. It's a great read. Given the weight of expectations (and money) riding on her second book, the conditions were ripe for Niffenegger to dig her own grave. But it turns out that in her second book, <em>Her Fearful Symmetry, </em>Niffenegger gets her characters to do the grisly digging for themselves while she floats out smelling like a rose.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="readFullReviewContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">Read the Full Review</a></strong><h3>Synopsis</h3><p><b>Four thousand copies of this signed limited Collector's Edition with a cover painting by the author and special design elements were printed in September 2009.</b></p><h3>The New York Times -

											This novel was not as great as Niffenegger's-The Time Traveler's Wife. I admit that book was an interesting ghost read, and the plot was original. The writing the well done, but I couldn't stand the ending of the tale.  <p/><p/> Maybe Audrey Niffenegger next book will be better. Don't get me wrong I would suggest people to read this novel, but I would mention to read The Time Traveler's Wife first before you read Her Fearful Symmetry.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Time-Travelers-Wife/Audrey-Niffenegger/e/9780156029438/?pv=y">The Time Traveler's Wife</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Guardian/Nicholas-Sparks/e/9780446696111/?pv=y">The Guardian</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Thorn-Birds/Colleen-McCullough/e/9780517201657/?pv=y">Thorn Birds</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Thirteenth-Tale/Diane-Setterfield/e/9780743298032/?pv=y">The Thirteenth Tale</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>An Interesting Ghost Story<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=SarahsWords">SarahsWords</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1397000_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781439165393_BK_24_1397000" href="#previewReview_1397000" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 29, 2010: 
											I thought this was a unique and interesting book.  I thought the characters were unique and exciting.  I could not put it down, and even though the ending was a little sad I enjoyed the twist and the overall plot flow.  The relationship between the two sisters and the aunt and the mother are very complex, tangled, and deep.  Their conflicts and problems are opposite yet their solutions mirror each other in some ways.  I have never read another book by her but I am looking forward to it.  I would encourage others to read this book, it is not your average story.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35704068.JPG" alt="" height="151" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Audrey Niffenegger</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Chicago, Illinois</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>June 13, 1963</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>South Haven, Michigan</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.F.A., School of the Art Institute of Chicago, 1985; M.F.A., Northwestern University, 1991</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Illinois Art Council Fellowship in Prose, 2000; Ragdale Foundation Fellowships, 1996-2003</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>In her book <I>Three Incestuous Sisters</I>, Audrey Niffenegger tells the tale of a trio of sisters, each with her own special trait. There is blond Bettine, the beautiful one, blue-haired Ophile, the smart one, and then there's Clothilde. While hardly unintelligent and certainly not unattractive, it is still probably no coincidence that Niffenegger decided to cast her fellow redhead Clothilde as the talented one considering that she is so abundant in talent. A gifted illustrator and writer, Niffenegger is parlaying her quirky imagination into one of the most interesting bodies of work in contemporary literature. <p>    Niffenegger's love of writing developed when she was a young girl, quietly spending her time writing and illustrating books as a hobby. Her wonderfully eccentric imaginativeness was in play from her earliest writing efforts. "My �first' novel was an epic about an imaginary road trip [sic] I went on with The Beatles," she explains on her website, "handwritten in turquoise marker, seventy pages long, which I wrote and illustrated when I was eleven."<p>    Niffenegger's mini-magical mystery tour may have been her "first novel," but the first one to which the rest of the world would be privy came many years later. She had already established herself as a prominent artist whose work had been shown in the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Library of Congress, and the Houghton Library at Harvard University when <I>The Time Traveler's Wife</I> was published in 2003. "I wanted to write about a perfect marriage that is tested by something outside the control of the couple," Niffenegger told bookbrowse.com. "The title came to me out of the blue, and from the title sprang the characters, and from the characters came the story." <p>    <I>The Time Traveler's Wife</I>, a sci-fi romance about the mercurial time traveler Henry and Clare, the wife who patiently awaits his return to the present, became a sensation upon its publication. This thoroughly original love story captured mass praise from <I>USA Today</I>, <I>The Washington Post</I>, <I>People Magazine</I>, and <I>The Denver Post</I>, not to mention celebrity couple Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt, who promptly purchased the rights to the book and are currently developing it into a motion picture. <p>    Now that she had established herself as a talent to watch, Niffenegger finally had the opportunity to produce a book she would describe as "a fourteen-year labor of love." <I>Three Incestuous Sisters: An Illustrated Novel</I>, is a gorgeous, modern-gothic storybook about the love and rivalry shared between three women. With its minimal text, Niffenegger's chiefly uses her eerie illustrations to convey the sisters' story. <I>Booklist</I> summed up <I>Three Incestuous Sisters</I> quite succinctly by stating that "Niffenegger's grim yet erotic tale and stunningly moody gothic prints possess the sly subversion of Edward Gorey, the emotional valence of Edvard Munch, and her very own brilliant use of iconographic pattern, surprising perspective, and tensile line in the service of a delectable, otherworldly sensibility." <p>    Now, Niffenegger is turning her attentions back to straight prose as she works on a new novel. "It's called <I>Her Fearful Symmetry</I>," she revealed in an online chat with the Hennepin County Library. "It's set in London's Highgate Cemetery, and features as many of the cliches of 19th century fiction as I can summon." Amazingly, with such a wide variety of styles in her still budding body of work -- from science fiction to fairy tale to her impending period piece -- Audrey Niffenegger's books still share a strong sense of unity, a distinctly peculiar and particular vision. "The thing that unites all my work is narrative," she said on her website. "I'm interested in telling stories, and I'm interested in creating a world that's recognizable to us as ours, but is filled with strangeness and slight changes in the rules of the universe." <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>In our interview, Niffenegger shared some fun facts about herself:</I> <p>    <b>"My current job is teaching graduate students how to write,</b> print type on letterpresses, and create limited-edition books by hand. I work for Columbia College's Center for Book and Paper Arts in Chicago. I helped to found the Center, and it is the center of my universe nine months of the year. The other three months I try to ignore the phone, and I do my own work."<p>    <b>"I make art. Readers can see some of it at Printworks Gallery</b> in Chicago. They have a web site: printworkschicago.com."<p>    <b>"Almost all of the places mentioned in my book are real places</b> that you can visit. The Newberry Library is open to people who have research projects that fit the collections of the Newberry. Vintage Vinyl is a real record store in Evanston. The Aragon Ballroom, South Haven, Michigan, Bookman's Alley, The Berghoff -- I heartily recommend them all." <p>    <b>"I collect taxidermy, skeletons, books (of course), comics</b> (mostly <I>Raw</I> and post-<I>Raw</I> independent stuff, no superheroes). I only collect small taxidermy, no bison heads, my place isn't that big. I don't own a TV. I spend a lot of time hanging out with my boyfriend, Christopher Schneberger, and attending Avocet concerts (Avocet is the band Chris plays drums with). We travel a lot; my new book is set in London, so there's lots of research to do. I garden, in a rather haphazard way. I also enjoy finding, buying, and wearing vintage clothes. All in all, it's a pleasant life."<p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2004, we asked authors featured in Meet the Writers to give us a list of their all-time favorite summer reads, and tell us what makes them just right for the season. Here's what Audrey Niffenegger had to say: </I><p>    I tend to like long books in the summer, when I have all the time in the world to read. Here are some favorites, old and new: <p>    <li><I>His Dark Materials</I> by Phillip Pullman -- My essentially atheist nature is thrilled by a children's book in which God dies and it doesn't matter, and people's souls take the form of animals which accompany their owners everywhere like pets. A great read late at night on a screened-in porch.<p>    <li><I>War and Peace</I> by Leo Tolstoy -- I first read this in a cabin in the Hiawatha National Forest, and so for me it's always associated with the smell of pine and the lapping of Lily Lake. It's grand and so beautiful.<p>    <li><I>Smilla's Sense of Snow</I> by Peter Hoeg -- A boy falls off a roof in Copenhagen, and Smilla is the only person who notices that his footprints run off the roof. Who was chasing him? This is a quiet, meditative thriller, fun to read in hot weather for obvious reasons.<p>    <li><I>The Lord of the Rings</I> by J.R.R. Tolkien -- This hardly needs any promotion from me, but I've re-read it every summer since I was twelve; these are my quintessential summer books.  <p>  <li><I>Trash Sex Magic</I> by Jennifer Stevenson -- This book is just coming out in June. It rocks. It's funny, sexy, and weird. It's about sex magicians who live on he banks of the Fox River in trailer homes. The women in the trailers onsort with the tree god across the road. Then some developers cut it down to build town homes and the fun begins. Very strange, very cool.<p>    <li><I>Ursula, Under</I> by Ingrid Hill. A little girl falls into an abandoned mine shaft. While we are waiting for the rescue crews to get her out, Ingrid Hill takes us through her family tree (she's Finnish/Chinese) and shows us all the amazing lives that accumulated to make this tiny girl who is waiting at the bottom of a hole. It's funny, it's huge, and it gives you a sort of History Vertigo.<p>    <li><I>Was</I> by Geoff Ryman -- A dark, inspired riff on <I>The Wizard of Oz</I>. There are  three interwoven stories: Dorothy as a real Kansas girl in the 1870s and 80s; the making of the movie <I>The Wizard of Oz</I> and the childhood of Judy  Garland; and a fictional character named Jonathan, who's obsessed with Oz and history and who is dying of AIDS. This one always makes me cry.<p>    <li><I>The Tale of Genji</I> by Lady Murasaki -- This is a must-read, summer or winter. Written in the eleventh century by Murasaki Shikibu, a court aristocrat whose father was a Buddhist priest, it's romantic, exotic, and a real page-turner. If you like to read bodice-rippers by the pool, this might work  for you. (Then again, you might think I am nuts.)<p>    <li><I>The Big Sleep</I> by Raymond Chandler -- Need I say more?<p>    <li><I>Black Water</I> by Alberto Manguel -- A great collection of short stories; they are  all fantastic (in both senses: weird and wonderful). This book was my introduction to many of my favorite oddities including <I>The Sick Gentleman's  Last Visit</I> by Giovanni Papini and <I>Father's Last Escape</I> by Bruno Schulz.<p>  --------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>    <I>In the fall of 2003, Audrey Niffenegger took some time to talk with us about her favorite book, authors, and interests.</I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>  <I>Harriet the Spy</I> by Louise Fitzhugh. I first read this book when I was nine. I identified with Harriet so completely that I went out and got myself a spy notebook and wrote in it all the time. My teachers made my mom take it away from me. I think I loved <I>Harriet the Spy</I> because I was a loner, because I read all the time and no one I knew did that, because I wanted to feel powerful, and writing can do that for you. I loved Harriet because she spoke her mind, because she lived in a big city and traveled around by herself without fear, because she knew what was what. <I>The Long Secret</I>, Fitzhugh's sequel to <I>Harriet the Spy,</I> is also a wonderful and very odd book. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>    In no particular order: <p>    <li><I>Maus</I> by Art Spiegelman -- I am a visual artist as well as a writer, so many of the books I love are visual. <I>Maus</I> is a comic book about the Holocaust. It's the story of the Spiegelman family and their experiences in Auschwitz and afterward. It is extremely complex, subtle, and I cry every time I read it. <p>    <li><I>The Secret History</I> by Donna Tartt -- Donna Tartt is a terrific writer, and I envy her ability to make a world that goes down and down, and has no bottom; the characters are so seductive, you love them, and it's painful when things go wrong, as they must. I read <I>The Secret History</I> when it first came out and was entranced by the clashes between Greek ideals and ordinary life, and between desire and the onset of adulthood. <p>    <li><I>Gaudy Night</I> by Dorothy Sayers -- This is my favorite mystery novel, but it's really much more than that. It was written in the '30s, and it's set in a women's college in Oxford. Miss Sayers explores the questions of what it means to balance work and love, and whether men and women can ever understand each other. My characters Henry and Clare are somewhat inspired by Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. <p>    <li><I>Aubrey Beardsley</I> by  Brian Reade -- When I was 14, I had an earache and had to stay home from school for two weeks. My mother went to the library and brought home a big stack of art books, and this was in the stack. Aubrey Beardsley was a famous English illustrator who died of TB at the age of 26, after creating a truly peculiar and scandalous body of work. I began copying his style, which eventually led me to my own style of drawing. <p>    <li><I>Galatea 2.2</I> by Richard Powers -- It's very hard for me to pick just one Richard Powers book. <I>The Time of Our Singing</I> is marvelous, and <I>The Goldbug Variations</I> is probably the one to start with if you haven't read any of his books. But I love this one because of Helen, a computer neuralnet that the narrator, whose name is Richard Powers, teaches to read and understand English literature. Helen is sublime, and if I could have one wish I would wish to talk to her -- about Emily Dickinson, about anything at all. <p>    <li><I>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay</I> by Michael Chabon -- A novel about comics artists in the '30s, '40s, and '50s. I adore comics, and Michael Chabon has done excellent research, and understands the joy of making drawings that can talk. <p>    <li><I>The Waking Dream</I> -- This is an anthology of prints from the 16th century through the 19th century. All the prints are grotesque, or just weird. There are anatomical illustrations, engravings of things from wonder cabinets, wars, fantasias, dancing insects. I deeply need strangeness, and this is very fulfilling. <p>    <li><I>The Depository</I> by Andrzej Klimowski -- This is a novel without words, by English illustrator Andrzej Klimowski. It is like a silent film, a film noir, slow and dreamy, in fact it is a dream. An artist falls asleep at his worktable and dreams of flying people who have books growing out of their shoulder blades as wings. I love the style, and the blackness of the images, and the story.<p>    <li><I>The Selected Poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke</I> translated by Stephen Mitchell -- What can I say about Rilke? He seems to sum up my feelings about many things: love, work, death, seeing, being human. This is my favorite translation. Mr. Mitchell makes me forget that I'm reading in English. <p>    <li><I>Vox</I> by Nicholson Baker -- It's a smart book about sex (phone sex, that is). The world needs more of these. I was very impressed with the technical aspects of <I>Vox,</I> too, the way Mr. Baker renders complete persons using only dialogue, and the layers and nuances of both the man and the woman. Nicholson Baker's great strength as a writer is in his extreme use of detail, and looking at sex in extreme detail is a fun and disorienting experience. <p>      <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to  you?</b><br>  <li><I>Dead Man</I> -- Jim Jarmush  <li><I>The Tango Lesson</I> -- Sally Potter  <li><I>Eraserhead</I>, <I>Mulholland Drive</I>, <I>Blue Velvet</I> -- David Lynch  <li><I>Vertigo</I> -- Alfred Hitchcock  <li><I>Waking Life</I> -- Richard Linklater  <li><I>Wings of Desire</I> -- Wim Wenders  <li><I>Nosferatu</I> -- Both the original and the Klaus Kinski versions <p>    I love films that are intense, creepy, beautiful to look at, morally complex. I want a film to be smarter than me, to leave me with mysteries, to haunt my sleep. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to  listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  Punk and indie rock, and classical music. I listen to the Gang of Four, Golden Palominos, Elvis Costello, the Beatles, the Poster Children, Built to Spill, Crooked Fingers, Duvall, the Sex Pistols, Joni Mitchell, Bach, Chopin, the Kronos Quartet, early classical music, Lene Lovich, New Order, Andrew Bird, Dianogagh, the Pixies, the Breeders, Kate Bush, and Bj�rk. <p>    I can only listen to things I've already heard a thousand times while I'm writing. Otherwise I pay attention to the music, and I can't write. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading -- and why?</b><br>  I'd like to have a Complete Works Book Club. We would read the Complete Works of Wilkie Collins, Chris Ware, Edward Gorey, Josephine Tey, Dan Claus, Julie Doucet, E. B. White. No rhyme or reason, but always everything they wrote. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  Art books always please my friends -- they're all artists. I like to give <I>Pat the Bunny</I> as a baby shower gift. And I give cookbooks to my mom. <p>    I like to receive books from friends who have seen my bookshelves and know that I collect old medical texts and Rosamond Wolfe Purcell books. Books that are bound in interesting ways are always welcome, especially if they are old. I like old books a lot. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on  your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  No special rituals. I'm so busy that I'm like a starving person: I sit down and I write. I have no schedule, either, I just write whenever I can squeeze it in. I have a photograph of my great-aunt Dulcie on my worktable. It was taken around 1900. She's a young woman, and she looks very benevolent. I only met her once. She was old, and she was driving a tractor. <p>    <b>What are you working on now?</b><br>  A new novel, <I>Her Fearful Symmetry</I>. It's set in London, near Highgate Cemetery. I'm trying to include all the clich�s of 19th-century English writing: mirror-image twins, mistaken identity, mysterious death, obsessive-compulsive disorder. And I want all these things in there, and I want to make them new, and interesting, and contemporary. That's the idea, anyway.<p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  Um. I guess I'm more or less an overnight success story. I worked on <I>The Time Traveler's Wife</I> for four and a half years. It took me nine months to find an agent, and we found a publisher quite quickly. The manuscript was rejected by about 20 agents. All I can say is, keep trying -- it only takes one agent and one editor who love you. <p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be -- and why?</b><br>  Josie Kearns, a poet who lives near Ann Arbor, Michigan. Her most recent collection, <I>New Numbers,</I> is wonderful. She invented numbers and wrote poems about the emotional and physical properties each one possesses. The poems are surprising, thoughtful, sometimes downright spooky. <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  People kept telling me not to expect much. Everything I read that was directed at writers trying to get published hammered in the fact that writers are plentiful, editors and agents are overworked, and the odds are against you. So I would say, hey, be realistic, but also keep your hopes up. Make sure you don't send anything out until it's wonderful. Work hard at revising. Do not give up. Keep writing. The submissions process is like dating. It only takes one person who thinks you're fabulous to make it work. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</h3><p>Fortune's wheel is a harsh chastiser, and those lucky writers who have found heady success with their first books often come crashing down with the second, never to rise again. What's the cause? Do they succumb to nerves from external expectations? Do they secretly feel unworthy? Are our expectations as readers unreasonable? Have they merely been sport for the gods?<br /><br /><em>The Time Traveler's Wife, </em>Audrey Niffenegger's first book, was Cinderella at the ball -- a book that got published without a literary agent behind it, a popular success that was a critical one too. Its distinctive (and, I assume from Niffenegger's acknowledgments, long-steeped) flavor completely eluded the dumb movie made from it. Describing the novel as blending fantasy, science fiction, romance, mild philosophy, and epistolary traditions is technically accurate, but fails to capture its unusual charm: its balance of inevitability and suspense, the importance of conversations both humorous and tersely poignant, the cultural riffs and bookish background of Chicago in the '80s and '90s, the bubble of optimism that buoys it up even in the face of death and decay. It's a great read. Given the weight of expectations (and money) riding on her second book, the conditions were ripe for Niffenegger to dig her own grave. But it turns out that in her second book, <em>Her Fearful Symmetry, </em>Niffenegger gets her characters to do the grisly digging for themselves while she floats out smelling like a rose.<br /><br />The book is mostly set in London, indeed mostly in, around, and even under Highgate Cemetery. Connoisseurs of graveyards will recognize it as the now lushly overgrown final resting place of Victorians eager to escape the horrors of urban burial where Dickens, among others, described dogs running off with the bones of the less recently departed. Famous inhabitants of Highgate include Karl Marx, George Eliot, and Lizzie Siddal, dug up seven years after her death by her husband, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, when he had second thoughts about publishing those manuscript poems he'd romantically but rashly buried with her. (The story goes that her red-gold hair had continued to grow to fill the coffin, but the red-leather-covered manuscript was worm-holed, damp, and stained.)<br /><br />The cemetery provides the ground against which twin American young women -- still really girls in much of their behavior and manner, naive and antiseptic -- come to determine the shape of their lives. Julia and Valentina have grown up in the Chicago suburbs. They have taken on some unimaginative generational protective coloration (on tv "President Bush was talking to Karl Rove.... The twins gave the finger to the president and his aide in unison"), but they are in fact rather odd. To begin with, they are physically distinctive -- pale and etiolated -- and there are two of them, identical but flipped: mirror-image twins. They usually dress identically and do the same things. They are striking, and yet somehow insubstantial. Their actions and opinions are curiously trivial. But, as the man said, the prospect of death concentrates the mind wonderfully. The twins first face death at a distance. An aunt, their mother's twin sister, whom they barely knew existed, has died and left them something: her flat, which not only overlooks Highgate Cemetery but is built into its walls. When they move there, death becomes closer.<br /><br />Even unavoidable. Robert, one of their fellow tenants and their Aunt Elspeth's lover, should serve as an instructive example. He started off visiting the cemetery because he was writing a dissertation about Victorian funerary practices and ended up living next door to it, giving tours of the cemetery, and sneaking in at night. Robert has found that "he liked the cemetery itself much better than anything he wrote about it." That's saying something, because his draft is very long. Their other fellow tenant, Martin, is an obsessive-compulsive crossword-puzzle setter -- the cryptic kind, natch. He escapes the cemetery's influence by papering over his windows. Or does he? For surely he's managed to immure himself in a simulacrum of a crypt. In fact, all of them -- Martin, Julia, Valentina, and even the dead Elspeth -- share Robert's problem: "He began to take the cemetery personally and lost all perspective."<br /><br />Niffenegger lures us into this sepulchral world, too. For the most part, she shapes her crepuscular atmosphere subtly, even down to using English spellings. As a child, I had a quite distinct sense of certain words when they were spelled the English way: "draught" (which I mispronounced) seemed hollower and more penetratingly chilly than "draft," "spectre" more haunting, and "grey" a wispy whisper of tint. Like the best ghost stories, Niffenegger's ghost story takes shape from evocative foggy patches, half-remembered phrases and twists of plot. It's not exactly deja vu all over again, but<em> Her Fearful Symmetry </em>is a very bookish ghost story. In fact, Elspeth, her ghost, learns a lot about post-life behavior via books -- Henry James, M. R. James, No�l Coward, and <em>Gray's Anatomy.</em><br /><br />The Victorians thrilled to ghost stories, creepy ones, of course, but even ultimately comic ones like Dickens's <em>A Christmas Carol.</em> Recently, in the last ten years or so, there seems to have been a resurgence of wonderful, and bookish, supernatural tales: A. S. Byatt's <em>The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye, </em>Susannah Clarke's <em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell, </em>and Neil Gaiman's <em>Cemetery Book. </em>These books seem to transcend the limitations of pastiche and genre to appeal to people who don't think of themselves as liking science fiction, fantasy, or ghost stories -- and that would include me. Audrey Niffenegger's book -- in which Gaiman appears in the lengthy acknowledgments -- is a worthy addition to these predecessors.<br /><br />An additional note: Niffenegger has endowed Robert with an extensive admiration for a bunch of famous dead Victorians, but he disdains Mrs. Henry Wood, the author of sensational stories like her bestselling novel <em>East Lynne</em>. Robert might be a happier man today if he'd read her more seriously. The melodramatic <em>East Lynne</em> turns on adultery, disguise, and a dying child. But of the 30 or so novels Ellen Wood wrote, her own favorite was <em>The Shadow of Ashlydyat, </em>a ghost story in which supernatural phenomena are not explained away, and in which (most unusually for the moral Mrs. Wood, whose first novel won an award from a temperance society) an energetic and unscrupulous woman is left unchecked at the end. Both of these novels are still in print more than 100 years later. That's an afterlife to aspire to. --<i>Alexandra Mullen<br><br>Alexandra Mullen left a life as an academic in Victorian literature to return to her roots as a general reader. She now writes for</i> The Hudson Review <i>(where she is also an Advisory Editor),</i> The New Criterion, <i>and</i> The Wall Street Journal.</p><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Like its predecessor, <i>The Time Traveler's Wife, Her Fearful Symmetry</i> has a plot both vividly original and yet evocative of time-etched genres; in this case, the neo-gothic. The story involves Julia and Valentina, seemingly typical American teens who have inherited their aunt's London flat. The apartment, as it happens, sits beside Highgate Cemetery, a shadowy burial place that possesses a presence of its own. To this strange mix, Niffenegger adds a medley of neighbors with whole battalions of obsessions and other disorders. The plot is engulfing, the characters unforgettable.
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>Six years after the phenomenal success of <i>The Time Traveler's Wife,</i> Audrey Niffenegger has returned with a spectacularly compelling and haunting second novel set in and around Highgate Cemetery in London. 
<br><br>
When Elspeth Noblin dies of cancer, she leaves her London apartment to her twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. These two American girls never met their English aunt; they only knew that their mother, too, was a twin, and Elspeth her sister. Julia and Valentina are semi-normal American teenagers -- with seemingly little interest in college, finding jobs, or anything outside their cozy home in the suburbs of Chicago, and with an abnormally intense attachment to one another. 
<br><br>
The girls move to Elspeth's flat, which borders Highgate Cemetery. They come to know the building's other residents. There is Martin, a brilliant and charming crossword puzzle setter suffering from crippling obsessive-compulsive disorder; Marjike, Martin's devoted but trapped wife; and Robert, Elspeth's elusive former lover, a scholar of the cemetery. As the girls become embroiled in the fraying lives of their aunt's neighbors, they also discover that much is still alive in Highgate, including -- perhaps -- their aunt, who can't seem to leave her old apartment and life behind. <br><br>

Niffenegger weaves a captivating story in <i>Her Fearful Symmetry:</i> about love and identity, about secrets and sisterhood, and about the tenacity of life -- even after death.</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Susann Cokal</h3><p>&#8230;bewitching&#8230;Lovers of Niffenegger's past work should rejoice. This outing may not be as blindly romantic as <i>The Time Traveler�s Wife,</i> but it is mature, complex and convincing&#151;a dreamy yet visceral tale of loves both familial and erotic, a search for Self in the midst of obsession with an Other. <i>Her Fearful Symmetry</i> is as atmospheric and beguiling as a walk through Highgate itself.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Ron Charles</h3><p>Niffenegger slowly draws out the relationship between the indolent young twins in a strange dance that's alternately charming and sinister&#8230;Their sisterly devotion sounds sweet until it seems suffocating, with a touch of incestuous frisson that would leave Edgar Allan Poe queasy&#8230;keep the children away and dust off the Ouija board; you're about to make contact with something deliciously creepy.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Niffenegger follows up her spectacular The Time Traveler's Wife with a beautifully written if incoherent ghost story. When Elspeth Noblin dies, she leaves everything to the 20-year-old American twin daughters of her own long-estranged twin, Edie. Valentina and Julia, as enmeshed as Elspeth and Edie once were, move into Elspeth's London flat bordering Highgate Cemetery in a building occupied by Elspeth's lover, Robert, and the novel's most interesting character, Martin, whose wife is long suffering due to his crushing and beautifully portrayed OCD. The girls are pallid and incurious; they wander around London and spend time with Robert and Martin and Elspeth's ghost. Valentina's developing relationship with Robert arouses mild jealousy, and when Valentina pursues her interest in fashion design, Julia disapproves, which leads Valentina and Elspeth to concoct an extreme plan to allow Valentina to lead her own life. The plan, unsurprisingly, goes awry, followed by weakly foreshadowed and confusing twists that take the plot from dull to silly. While Niffenegger's gifted prose and past success will garner readers, the story is a disappointment. (Sept.)
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Twin sisters inherit a London flat, and a bundle of baggage, from their mother's long-estranged twin. Elspeth has expired at 44 of cancer, leaving her younger lover and neighbor Robert bereft and obsessed with her memory. Robert is entrusted with her diaries and named executor of her will, which bequeaths her flat and substantial cash reserves to her 20-year-old twin nieces, Julia and Valentina. Elspeth's twin sister Edie and her husband Jack, a Chicago banker, receive nothing and are expressly forbidden to visit the flat. Presumably, Elspeth's hostility stems from the fact that, 20 years before, Edie had eloped with Jack, then Elspeth's fiance, and fled with him to Chicago. When the girls move to London, their own sibling rivalry escalates. Julia dominates minutes-younger Valentina, forcing her to share a life of indolence rather than pursue her ambition to be a fashion designer. Robert, a perennial doctorate candidate writing his thesis on the historic 19th-century cemetery Highgate, is intimately familiar with all manner of Victorian morbidity, including the extreme measures taken to avoid being buried alive. Robert introduces the twins to the all-volunteer staff of Highgate, where many luminaries, including Karl Marx and George Eliot, are buried. Valentina is drawn to Robert, who finds her resemblance to Elspeth uncanny, unnerving and ultimately irresistible. Julia befriends upstairs neighbor Martin, an obsessive-compulsive agoraphobe whose wife, finally fed up with his draconian rituals, has just left him. Meanwhile, Elspeth has returned to her former flat, training her ghostly self to communicate with the occupants. Only Valentina can see her, and she enlists her aunt's aid ingetting free of Julia. The manner in which Elspeth accomplishes Valentina's liberation, and the mind-boggling double cross revealed in the diaries, are breathtakingly far-fetched. Gimmickry, supernatural and otherwise, blunts what could have been an incisive inquiry into the mysteries and frustrations of too-close kinship from the talented Niffenegger (The Time Traveler's Wife, 2003, etc.).

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><big><b><p>The End</b></big><P>Espeth died while Robert was standing in front of a vending machine watching tea shoot into a small plastic cup. Later he would remember walking down the hospital corridor with the cup of horrible tea in his hand, alone under the fluorescent lights, retracing his steps to the room where Elspeth lay surrounded by machines. She had turned her head towards the door and her eyes were open; at first Robert thought she was conscious.In<P> the seconds before she died, Elspeth remembered a day last spring when she and Robert had walked along a muddy path by the Thames in Kew Gardens. There was a smell of rotted leaves; it had been raining. Robert said, "We should have had kids," and Elspeth replied, "Don't be silly, sweet." She said it out loud, in the hospital room, but Robert wasn't there to hear.<P>Elspeth turned her face towards the door. She wanted to call out, <I>Robert</i>, but her throat was suddenly full. She felt as though her soul were attempting to climb out by way of her oesophagus. She tried to cough, to let it out, but she only gurgled. <I>I'm drowning. Drowning in a bed</i>...She felt intense pressure, and then she was floating; the pain was gone and she was looking down from the ceiling at her small wrecked body.<P>Robert stood in the doorway. The tea was scalding his hand, and he set it down on the nightstand by the bed. Dawn had begun to change the shadows in the room from charcoal to an indeterminate grey; otherwise everything seemed as it had been. He shut the door.<P>Robert took off his round wire-rimmed glasses and his shoes. He climbed into the bed, careful not to disturb Elspeth, and folded himself around her. For weeks she had burnedwith fever, but now her temperature was almost normal. He felt his skin warm slightly where it touched hers. She had passed into the realm of inanimate objects and was losing her own heat. Robert pressed his face into the back of Elspeth's neck and breathed deeply.<P>Elspeth watched him from the ceiling. How familiar he was to her, and how strange he seemed. She saw, but could not feel, his long hands pressed into her waist -- everything about him was elongated, his face all jaw and large upper lip; he had a slightly beakish nose and deep-set eyes; his brown hair spilled over her pillow. His skin was pallorous from being too long in the hospital light. He looked so desolate, thin and enormous, spooned around her tiny slack body; Elspeth thought of a photograph she had seen long ago in <I>National Geographic</i>, a mother clutching a child dead from starvation. Robert's white shirt was creased; there were holes in the big toes of his socks. All the regrets and guilts and longings of her life came over her. <I>No</i>, she thought. <I>I won't go.</i> But she was already gone, and in a moment she was elsewhere, scattered nothingness.<P>The nurse found them half an hour later. She stood quietly, taking in the sight of the tall youngish man curled around the slight, dead, middle-aged woman. Then she went to fetch the orderlies.<P>Outside, London was waking up. Robert lay with his eyes closed, listening to the traffic on the high street, footsteps in the corridor. He knew that soon he would have to open his eyes, let go of Elspeth's body, sit up, stand up, talk. Soon there would be the future, without Elspeth. He kept his eyes shut, breathed in her fading scent and waited.Copyright &#169; 2009 by Audrey Niffenegger<P><big><b><p>Last Letter</b></big><P>The letters arrived every two weeks. They did not come to the house. Every second Thursday, Edwina Noblin Poole drove six miles to the Highland Park Post Office, two towns away from her home in Lake Forest. She had a PO box there, a small one. There was never more than one letter in it.<P>Usually she took the letter to Starbucks and read it while drinking a venti decaf soy latte. She sat in a corner with her back to the wall. Sometimes, if she was in a hurry, Edie read the letter in her car. After she read it she drove to the parking lot behind the hotdog stand on 2nd Street, parked next to the Dumpster and set the letter on fire. "Why do you have a cigarette lighter in your glove compartment?" her husband, Jack, asked her. "I'm bored with knitting. I've taken up arson," Edie had replied. He'd let it drop.<P>Jack knew this much about the letters because he paid a detective to follow his wife. The detective had reported no meetings, phone calls or email; no suspicious activity at all, except the letters. The detective did not report that Edie had taken to staring at him as she burned the letters, then grinding the ashes into the pavement with her shoe. Once she'd given him the Nazi salute. He had begun to dread following her.<P>There was something about Edwina Poole that disturbed the detective; she was not like his other subjects. Jack had emphasised that he was not gathering evidence for a divorce. "I just want to know what she does," he said. "Something is...different." Edie usually ignored the detective. She said nothing to Jack. She put up with it, knowing that the overweight, shiny-faced man had no way of finding her out.<P>The last letter arrived at the beginning of December. Edie retrieved it from the post office and drove to the beach in Lake Forest. She parked in the spot farthest from the road. It was a windy, bitterly cold day. There was no snow on the sand. Lake Michigan was brown; little waves lapped the edges of the rocks. All the rocks had been carefully arranged to prevent erosion; the beach resembled a stage set. The parking lot was deserted except for Edie's Honda Accord. She kept the motor running. The detective hung back, then sighed and pulled into a spot at the opposite end of the parking lot.<P>Edie glanced at him. <I>Must I have an audience for this?</i> She sat looking at the lake for a while. <I>I could burn it without reading it</i>. She thought about what her life might have been like if she had stayed in London; she could have let Jack go back to America without her. An intense longing for her twin overcame her, and she took the envelope out of her purse, slid her finger under the flap and unfolded the letter.<blockquote><I><P>Dearest e,<P>I told you I would let you know -- so here it is -- goodbye.<P>I try to imagine what it would feel like if it was you -- but it's impossible to conjure the world without you, even though we've been apart so long.<P>I didn't leave you anything. You got to live my life. That's enough. Instead I'm experimenting -- I've left the whole lot to the twins. I hope they'll enjoy it.<P>Don't worry, it will be okay.<P>Say goodbye to Jack for me.<p>Love, despite everything,<br />e</i></blockquote><P>Edie sat with her head lowered, waiting for tears. None came, and she was grateful; she didn't want to cry in front of the detective. She checked the postmark. The letter had been mailed four days ago. She wondered who had posted it. A nurse, perhaps.<P>She put the letter into her purse. There was no need to burn it now. She would keep it for a little while. Maybe she would just keep it. She pulled out of the parking lot. As she passed the detective, she gave him the finger.<P>Driving the short distance from the beach to her house, Edie thought of her daughters. Disastrous scenarios flitted through Edie's mind. By the time she got home she was determined to stop her sister's estate from passing to Julia and Valentina.<P>Jack came home from work and found Edie curled up on their bed with the lights off.<P>"What's wrong?" he asked.<P>"Elspeth died," she told him.<P>"How do you know?"<P>She handed him the letter. He read it and felt nothing but relief. <I>That's all</i>, he thought. <I>It was only Elspeth all along</i>. He climbed onto his side of the bed and Edie rearranged herself around him. Jack said, "I'm sorry, baby," and then they said nothing. In the weeks and months to come, Jack would regret this; Edie would not talk about her twin, would not answer questions, would not speculate about what Elspeth might have bequeathed to their daughters, would not say how she felt or let him even mention Elspeth. Jack wondered, later, if Edie would have talked to him that afternoon, if he had asked her. If he'd told her what he knew, would she have shut him out? It hung between them, afterwards.<P>But now they lay together on their bed. Edie put her head on Jack's chest and listened to his heart beating. <I>"Don't worry, it will be okay."...I don't think I can do this. I thought I would see you again. Why didn't I go to you? Why did you tell me not to come? How did we let this happen?</i> Jack put his arms around her. <I>Was it worth it?</i> Edie could not speak.<P>They heard the twins come in the front door. Edie disentangled herself, stood up. She had not been crying, but she went to the bathroom and washed her face anyway. "Not a word," she said to Jack as she combed her hair.<P>"Why not?"<P>"Because."<P>"Okay." Their eyes met in the dresser mirror. She went out, and he heard her say, "How was school?" in a perfectly normal voice. Julia said, "Useless." Valentina said, "You haven't started dinner?" and Edie replied, "I thought we might go to Southgate for pizza." Jack sat on the bed feeling heavy and tired. As usual, he wasn't sure what was what, but at least he knew what he was having for dinner.Copyright &#169; 2009 by Audrey Niffenegger
