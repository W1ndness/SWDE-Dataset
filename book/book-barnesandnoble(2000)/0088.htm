But as soon as the newlyweds return from their shortened honeymoon, they are hit with some exciting yet unsettling news&hellip;<br><br>It seems their dear ally Lizzie Fox, recently ensconced as Chief White House Counsel, is rumored to be near the top of the short list for a soon to be vacated seat on the Supreme Court. While the Sisters are thrilled for Lizzie, they are concerned about her being ripped to shreds in the approval process, partly due to her connections with the Sisterhood. They also fear it will delay or even derail their long-awaited pardon promised to them by President Martine Connor. It will take a masterful plan, and loyal friends aiding them at every turn, for the Sisters to succeed in protecting Lizzie while securing their own freedom at last.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>With over than sixty million copies of her books sold around the world, <I>New York Times</I> bestselling author Fern Michaels pens romance after epic romance, each filled with all the drama and heartbreak her loyal fans can handle.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><h3>Customer Reviews</h3><ul class="reviewBox"><li class="first">Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget " id="9781420106879_BK"><span class="avg-3h section_updateRating"></span></span></li><li>Ratings: 11<span id="numReviews">Reviews: 2</span></li><li><p class="writeReview"><strong><a name="writeReview_OverviewTab" class="section_writeReview" rel="nofollow" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-Write-A-Review" href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/WriteReview.aspx?EAN=9781420106879"></a></strong></p></li></ul><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>exciting entry<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=harstan">harstan</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1408967_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781420106879_BK_1_1408967" href="#previewReview_1408967" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 22, 2010: 
											Knowing they are "duds", Myra and Charles cut off their honeymoon to return to the Sisterhood when they learn that her friend and advisor Lizzie Fox is being considered for an appointment to the Supreme Court.  The Sisterhood fears that the deserving White House Legal Counsel will be put through an unfair meat grinder to gain political points due mostly to Lizzie's association with them.<p/><p/>Although not quite as worried, as they are about Lizzie, the members are afraid their presidential pardon will vanish as politics as usual will prevail.  However, as they monitor events as only the Sisterhood could, they begin to uncover a conspiracy to use Fox and the Sisterhood to destroy the Administration.<p/><p/>Although over the top of the Cayman Islands, Big Pine Mountain and the Washington Monument, the seventeenth Sisterhood thriller is an exciting entry that sums up the values of the members of "one for all and all for one" (Dumas).  The group risks all their hard work to be pardoned to insure their loyal "affiliate" gets a fair shake.  Fans of the saga will appreciate their latest intervention as protecting Lizzie soon turns into protecting the Administration.<p/><p/>Harriet Klausner</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>SAD THAT IT IS OVER<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=JOJO64">JOJO64</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1384234_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781420106879_BK_1_1384234" href="#previewReview_1384234" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 12, 2010:

When her youngest child went off to kindergarten, Michaels's husband imperiously ordered her (in just so many words) to get off her ass and get a job. Long years in the domestic trenches had left her short on marketable skills, so she decided trade off her lifelong love of reading and write a book. Just like that. The domineering, unsupportive husband is history. And Michaels has gone on to pen bestselling romance after bestselling romance. Just like that..<p>    With typical modesty, Michaels does not claim to be a great writer; however, she admits proudly to being a born storyteller. Her bulging bookshelf proves she is all over the map, producing with equal facility hot historicals, lighthearted contemporary capers, adrenaline-laced thrillers, and heartwarming tales of family and friendship. She is especially adept at writing stories about women who prevail in hard times � a reflection, perhaps, of her own struggles in her marriage and early career.<p>     Raised to believe that the fortunate in life  have an obligation to give back, Michaels devotes a lot of time to philanthropic concerns. She has established a foundation that grants four-year scholarships to needy students and has set up pre-schools and daycare centers for single mothers. She is also an avid animal lover and has been known to own as many as five dogs at a time.<p>     In 1993, Michaels picked up stakes and moved from her home in New Jersey to a 300-year-old plantation house in Charleston, South Carolina. She and the dogs share the house amicably with a friendly ghost whom Fern has dubbed Mary Margaret. In addition to stopping clocks and moving pillows from room to room, Mary Margaret has been known to occasionally leave flowers on Michaels's nightstand!</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Michaels confesses in our interview:</b> "I'm a junk food junkie and a chocoholic. My desk drawers have more junk food in them than paper and pens. I chomp and chew all day long. At night I get up and eat Marshmallow Fluff right out of the jar. In between eating, I write."<p>    <b>Her first "sort of, kind of job"</b> was in market research. Michaels recounts the gig's low-point in our interview: "I had a partner and we were testing a new pressurized drain cleaner. All you had to do was put this can in the drain, squeeze and supposedly the drain would open right up. It did, all right. <p>    "The whole wall collapsed, and stuff that was in there for a hundred years flew everywhere. The lady didn't tell us the drain backed up to her kitchen drain and disposal. The company didn't care that we smelled like a sewer or that our clothes were ruined. The lady got a new bathroom, and we both got fired." <p>     <b>Michaels reveals some of her sources</b> of inspiration: "Inspiration comes from everywhere. The title for <I>Finders Keepers</I> came from a cartoon with two chipmunks that my grandson was watching. I had a title but no story. I finally came up with one to fit that wonderful title. <p>    "Names for characters sometime come from television. I had a character named Metaxis which is odd to begin with. There is a news anchor on T.V. who has that same last name. Sometimes it will just be a word someone says in passing, something I read or saw. There's no rhyme or reason to it. It's almost like, okay, I need something here, stay alert and it will happen."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2002, Fern Michaels answered some of our questions.</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life -- and why?</b> <br>  It was a Nancy Drew book titled, <I>The Mystery of the Brass Bound Trunk</I> by Carolyn Keene. As a child, it had everything: a secret, a challenge, a young woman detective who drove a car, her family, her best friends, and who had an insatiable curiosity. I wanted to do what Carolyn Keene did -- write about a secrets, challenges, and women who persevered. And that's exactly what I try to do.<p>    <b>What are your favorite books?</b><br>  <li><i>The Watchers</I> by Dean Koontz<p>  <li><I>The Firm</I> by John Grisham<p>  <li><I>The Bourne Ultimatum</i> by Robert Ludlum<p>  <li><I>The Bourne Supremacy</i> by Robert Ludlum<p>  <li><I>The Acquataine Progression</I> by Robert Ludlum<p>  <li><I>Clear and Present Danger</I> by Tom Clancy<p>  <li><I>Noble House</i> by John le Carre<p>  <li><I>Evergreen</i> by Belva Plain<p>  <li><I>Double Image</I> by Helen MacInnes<p>    These are my favorites because they make me stop and think: How, what, when? What kind of minds do these authors have to come up with these unbelievable plots? Also, because I know, even on my best day, I could never write stories like the ones I've listed. I try, and therein lies the challenge.<p>    <p><b>Favorite films?</b></br>  <li><I>Casablanca</I> -- I have three videos of his film and wore out two.<p>  <li><I>Top Gun</I><p>  <li><I>The Firm</i><p>  <li>Jaws</I> -- I've seen this film 84 times and know the dialogue by heart.<p>    <b>Favorite music?</b><br>  Anything by Frank Sinatra and Barry Manilow. <p>      <b>Who are your favorite writers, and what makes their writing special?</b><br>  Robert Ludlum for his command of the English language, his real-time plots and his superb research. I know he has passed away and I will miss his writings greatly.<p>    Dean Koontz for his way-out plots that make me crazy and wonder if this could <I>really</I> happen. He makes a believer out of me.<p>      <b>What else do you want your readers to know?</b><br>  First of all, I am a very boring person. That's not to say I was always a boring person. Been there, done that, as the saying goes. These days I spend a lot of time with my kids. I am a big animal rights activist and do all I can for them. I read, do a little gardening. Mostly I write. I like to buy furniture and kitchen gadgets. I have seven T.V.s in my house and turn them all on to news channels. I don't want to miss anything that is going on in the world.<p>    What I love most in the world are my kids and my grandkids and my five dogs. I have a very whimsical area on my second floor where all my dogs are painted on the walls. The ones who have gone over The Rainbow Bridge all have gold halos. Sometimes I go up there and cry.<p>    How do I unwind? With all the dogs on or around me. With a cigarette and a beer. Yes, I know, I shouldn't be doing that but I do. Sometimes if it's really stressful, I take the dogs for a run around my four acres. We run till we're breathless. When I can't sleep, I get up and go out on the verandah and listen to all the night sounds and drink a cup of tea. Along with that, Marshmallow Fluff I buy by the case. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>With yet another successful assignment behind them, the ladies of the Sisterhood have enjoyed a relaxing break together and celebrated the wedding of Myra and Charles on Big Pine Mountain.

Myra was the first to burst out laughing. Charles, looking sheepish, finally grinned and then laughed along with his wife. <p> "Wearing these silly flowered clothes under all this glorious sunshine, sipping ridiculous drinks with little umbrellas in them, isn't doing it for me, darling," Myra said. There was now a smile on her face, but it didn't reach her eyes. <p> "We have to suck it up, old girl. This is a ten-day honeymoon, compliments of our chicks, so we cannot return to the mountain until our time here in the Cayman Islands is up. Having said that, what would you like to do when we finish these drinks that are as silly as the clothes we're decked out in?" <p> Myra adjusted her oversize sunglasses. "We've already walked five miles on the beach. We had our morning swim. We had breakfast and lunch. We gathered shells. Unless you want to build a sand castle, I suggest we meander back to Mr. Stu Franklin's island paradise, where we can sit on the lanai and sip a scotch and soda. In four hours it will be time for dinner. Oh, goody, I can't wait!" <p> "Who knew a honeymoon could be so deadly?" Charles smiled. <p> Myra giggled like a schoolgirl as she linked her arm with Charles's for the trek back through the sand to their honeymoon cottage. <p> Thirty minutes later Charles made alow, sweeping bow when he said, "Our honeymoon abode awaits us, Mrs. Martin." <p> Myra tilted her head to the side and looked at the thatched-roof cottage. It was quaint, the thatching covering a red-tiled roof. A Hansel and Gretel island house. It was more than comfortable, with wonderful cross ventilation, billowing curtains, humming ceiling fans, comfortable furniture, and state-of-the-art appliances in the kitchen. The bathroom was a modern wonder, with colored glass, beautiful tile, and a whirlpool tub, along with a double shower with eighteen showerheads. The only downside was there was no television, radio, or telephone. <p> The lanai was filled with hibiscus and every other colorful island plant. A parrot came by from time to time and chatted them up with his seven-word vocabulary. As Charles had put it, "If we were twenty years old and on our first honeymoon, I'd vote never to leave this place." Myra had seconded his assessment. <p> "What shall we do now, old girl?" Charles asked his wife as he led her around to the lanai. He fluffed the cushions on the chaise lounge that was big enough for two people. <p> A sour expression on her face, Myra said, "What we've been doing every day since we got here, take a nap. I'm napped out, Charles. I want to go home." <p> "Annie said they were going to turn the cable car off so we can't go back. Dear heart, neither one of us is capable of hiking up that mountain." <p> "Speak for yourself, Charles. I don't care if it takes me three days to climb to the top. I want to go home." <p> "Bloody hell, let's pack, and we're out of here. I'll call Snowden to arrange our departure." <p> Myra was off the chaise and running into the house before Charles could click on his phone. "Thank you, God. Thank you, God," she kept muttering over and over as she threw her suitcase on the bed and, willy-nilly, tossed their clothes in. She rushed to the bathroom and ran her arm across the vanity, and in one fell swoop, the contents went into a small leather satchel. <p> Done! <p> "We're good to go, Charles," Myra said breathlessly. "How soon can we leave?" <p> "Forty minutes!" <p> "Details, darling, details." <p> "I just called for a taxi to take us to the airport. We will have private transportation to the mainland, and from there, Annie's Gulfstream will take us home. We will have a two-hour wait once we hit the mainland, but I didn't think you'd care about that any more than I do. Does this work for you, old girl?" <p> "It does, Charles. It really does. Oh, I feel almost giddy. Dear, you aren't ... you know ... disappointed that our honeymoon was so ... boring, are you?" <p> "Myra, our honeymoon was deadly boring, but thank you for being so kind. By the way, I'm glad you pushed the envelope. Now, we have to come up with some believable story for our early return. A story the girls will believe." <p> "They won't believe anything we tell them. You know that. They're going to <i>know</i>, Charles. We'll be honeymoon duds!" <p> Tongue in cheek, Charles said, "And this bothers you, my dear?" <p> Myra thought about the question. "Annie will be relentless!" <p> "Well, we're going to have a good many hours to come up with a story that will work for Annie. And the others." <p> "Can we make it risqu&eacute;, darling? Annie won't accept anything less." <p> "I'll put everything I have into it," Charles drawled. <p> Myra sighed happily. Her world was looking more wonderful by the minute. <p> <p> <H4> Chapter Two </H4> The room looked like an overcrowded gym, with workout clothes, water bottles, and sneakers scattered everywhere, along with sweaty bodies. The only problem was, the occupants in the room were not working out, nor was there any kind of machinery. No treadmills, no Exercycles. <p> The women were lying in various positions on the floor, glaring and cursing at the evil-looking pole in the middle of the room, the only sign that possibly the pole was the source of exercise. The psychedelic lighting inside the pole added to the snarling that was going on. <p> Kathryn Lucas rolled over on the floor and groaned aloud. "I am going to take an ax to that damn thing. Then I'm going to kill you, <i>Mom!</i>" <p> Annie eyed the pole, which she and the others had not been able to conquer. "I hate a quitter," she mumbled. <p> "Quitter! Quitter!" Nikki shrieked. "Is that what you said? Look at us!" she continued to shriek. "We're black and blue from top to bottom. My butt is so sore, I'm not going to be able to sit down for a month! I am one giant cramp. You better say something, Annie, or I'm going to help Kathryn strangle you." <p> Annie sniffed. "Obviously, all of you are out of shape. Pole dancing is an art. You need to pay closer attention to the tutorial. I'm way older than any of you, and I've made the most progress. Your performance is pathetic! Now, we're going to get to work and conquer this goddamn pole or die trying. Up and on your feet! I want to see all of you on your feet, and this time turn the music up. We are not, I repeat, we are not going to allow this pole to conquer us. Shame on all of you! We're women. We're supposed to be able to do anything. Wusses!" <p> "I hate you, Annie," Yoko cried pitifully. "I cannot do it." <p> "You <i>will</i> do it. That's an order!" Annie said as she massaged her thighs, grimacing in pain. "Now, let's see some agility here! You're up, Alexis." <p> Alexis struggled to her feet, her expression mirroring Kathryn's as she stumbled to the stripper pole. She swiped her hands on her shorts, gritted her teeth, and reached out to the pole. The muscles in her upper arms bulged. The others held their breath as she leaped at the pole and got smacked right in the nose for her effort. She slid to the floor and started to cry. She rolled over to get out of the way as Isabelle, her face grim, shouted something obscene as she took a run at the pole, grabbed it, and swung around, her long legs wrapping around the pole. The beat of the frenzied music seemed to give her some impetus as she whirled around and around, then fell to the floor in a miserable heap. <p> "Bravo!" Annie shouted excitedly. <p> "Screw you, Annie. That's it! Do you hear me? I am never touching this pole again. Ever, ever, ever! If I have to, I'll <i>chew</i> it till it falls apart," Isabelle snarled as she, too, rolled out of the way so Nikki could take her turn. <p> All eyes were on Nikki's grim but determined face. The calves and thighs of her legs burning, she eyed the pole like it was her enemy, which it was at this point in time. She didn't run to it. Instead, she marched up to it, raised her arms, grabbed the pole, her knuckles white. Carefully, she swung her right leg, which was bruised from thigh to ankle, and wrapped it around the pole. Her left leg followed suit. Her jaw tight, her eyes closed, she straightened her back, took a deep breath, and started to rotate her hips to the beat of the music. Somehow or other, she managed to command her body to slither upward, then downward. And then she stunned everyone by doing three full swings around the pole before she allowed herself to slide all the way down in a crumpled heap. <p> Roars of approval and clapping hands made Nikki burst out laughing. She rolled over and clutched at her ribs. "That's it," she gasped. "I am never, ever going to touch that pole again! You'll have to kill me first." <p> The others seconded her declaration as they all managed somehow to get to their feet, moaning and groaning at the pain in their abused muscles. <p> It normally would have taken the Sisters five minutes to slip into their outer gear for the trek across the compound to the main dining room and kitchen, but this time it took almost twenty. They were through the door when Annie's cell phone chirped. She flipped it open and heard a voice command her to send the cable car to the base of the mountain. The Sisters stopped in their tracks when they heard Annie say, "But there's ice on the cable. All right, Charles. I'll do it." <p> Their pain forgotten for the moment, the Sisters all started talking at once. <p> "They can't be back already!" <p> "What kind of honeymoon is over that quick?" <p> "Maybe something happened!" <p> "What if the cable car gets stalled?" <p> "This is not good!" <p> Kathryn summed it all up by saying, "Now it's Myra's turn on the pole." <p> Annie was already halfway to the cable car and didn't hear Kathryn's comment. <p> Annie's hand was on the switch to send the car to the base of the mountain when Nikki reached out. "What if the car gets stuck halfway down?" <p> "At least it will get stuck going <i>down</i>, not coming up. The trip down will melt the ice. Coming up should be a breeze. It was an order from Charles, dear," Annie said, shrugging off Nikki's hand. She pressed the power button, and the hydraulics came to life. <p> The cable car slid out of its nest and started down the mountain. The women could see shards of ice flying right and left as the car made its slow, steady descent. All eyes were on the control panel, which marked its progress. <p> Annie's fist shot in the air when the cable car made contact with the hidden platform built into the base of the mountain. The Sisters sucked in their breath as one when the control panel showed the car was on the way up. <p> "I sure hope that guy Reggie, who Charles had working on the cable car, knew his business," Annie whispered. <p> "I remember Charles saying he was up on the latest on cable cars and that he worked on them in the Swiss Alps and this sort of thing happens all the time over there," Isabelle whispered in return. <p> "Why are we whispering?" Alexis whispered. <p> "Because we're afraid, and talking loud might ... might ... Oh, I don't know," Yoko said in a hushed voice. <p> "Trigger an avalanche of snow?" Nikki said, her voice short of hysterical. <p> "Anything is possible. However, I think it unlikely," Annie snapped in a normal tone of voice. <p> And then the cable car slid into its nest, and everyone heaved a huge sigh of relief. <p> The Sisters rushed to embrace the newlyweds and chastise them at the same time for their early return. Everyone started talking at once as the girls struggled to carry Myra's and Charles's luggage back to the main building through the snow. <p> Inside, the babble continued as Annie made her way to the kitchen to remove two long trays of brownies she'd set the timer to bake while she and the others worked the pole. She turned on the burner on the stove to heat the hot chocolate she'd prepared ahead of time. <p> The Sisters did their best to ignore their aches and pains, their bruises and abrasions, by bombarding the newlyweds with questions about their honeymoon. <p> "It was pleasant," Charles said. <p> "No, it wasn't. It was boring," Myra said. <p> "We ate a lot and walked on the beach," Charles said. <p> "Charles ate a lot, whereas I ate healthfully and sparingly, and we <i>trudged</i> on the beach," Myra said, correcting her new husband. <p> "We read a lot," Charles said. <p> "That's not quite true, dear. I read a lot. Somehow Charles found someone who allowed him to use his fax machine, and he read reports that came in to him at the speed of light." <p> "You look tired, Charles," Annie said pointedly. <p> Charles looked around. Well, he didn't just fall off the watermelon truck. He knew when he wasn't wanted. He pretended to huff and puff as he pulled on his jacket and made his way to the door. He was halfway there when he turned and came back. He kissed his wife soundly on the cheek and said, "Now, don't be giving away what we really did on our honeymoon. Some things should remain sacred, old girl." <p> Myra blushed a rosy hue as she waved her husband toward the door. The minute the door closed, she said, "It was a <i>water bed!</i> Do you believe that? We couldn't ... what I mean is ... We got seasick. We slept on the floor after ... well, after we found out it was a water bed. Charles was so ... <i>inept</i>." <p> Annie poured the hot chocolate. She sniffed. "That's probably more than we really need to know, dear." <p> "Hogwash. That's all you really wanted to know, <i>dear</i>, and you know it," Myra retorted. "Let me sum it up for you, Annie. The sex end of the honeymoon was a disaster. Charles has a bad back. He had most of the blankets and covers. One night I slept on the beach, because the sand was soft. But, I got sand in every orifice of my body, and I will never do that again." <p> "My-raaa!" Annie screeched. <p> "Oh, hush, Annie. You are reveling in the details of my honeymoon. But I am now willing to make a wager with you. I will wager my pearls against your pearls that I can master that ... that stripper pole with all the lights in it. I'm ready and willing to take on all comers. Do we have a date for the recital yet?" <p> The Sisters' eyes popped, their jaws dropped, and Annie sat down with a thump and immediately regretted it. <p> "Your ... heirloom pearls! Your one-of-a-kind, priceless pearls? The pearls you feel naked without? Those pearls?" Annie managed to gasp. <p> "Yes, Countess de Silva, <i>those pearls</i>," said Myra. <p> "Are you telling us you ... you practiced on a stripper pole while you were on your honeymoon?" Nikki managed to squeak out as she recalled her own dismal performance and the aches and pains that had followed her efforts. <p> "I am saying no such thing. Charles was glued to me the entire time, except for the night I slept on the beach. I wouldn't have even known where to look to find a pole to ... practice on." <p> "Then how ...?" Yoko managed to weigh in. <p> "Just you never mind, honey. So are you going to take my bet or not, Annie?" <p> Annie eyed her old friend warily. She tried to read something in Myra's expression but saw nothing to ease her fear that Myra had some kind of secret power that would make fools out of all of them. She had no choice but to take her old friend up on the wager. She tried to work some excitement and jubilation into her voice when she said, "You're on, Myra!" <p> Myra laughed, to Annie's discomfort. "Maybe we'll be able to take our show on the road. After the recital, of course." <p> "Drink your hot chocolate and shut up, Myra, while I try to figure out if you are snookering me somehow to get my great-grandmother's pearls, which are just as lovely as yours. You just want a matched set," Annie sniped. <p> Myra smiled. <p> The Sisters shivered. <p> "Let's talk about something else, ladies," Nikki, ever the diplomat, said. "Has anyone heard from Lizzie? I wonder how her first four days at the White House are going. We should have heard something by now." <p> The others said they hadn't heard a word from the Silver Fox. <p> "Maybe Lizzie can't make personal calls from the White House, or maybe she's afraid the walls have ears," Yoko said. <p> "She's nine to five. Her nights are her own. She could have called us last night or the night before. But there is Cosmo, so maybe she wants her free time to be with him. The last time I spoke to her, she said he would be here for a week, while, as he put it, she got her feet wet at Sixteen Hundred Pennsylvania Avenue," Alexis said. <p> "The New Year started off with a bang in D.C. There is all kinds of stuff going on that the president has to deal with. I guess that means Lizzie has to deal with it, too. Like, for instance, yesterday I saw in the paper online that one of the Supreme Court justices is going to retire when the court goes into recess. Then today the paper said that rumor was false. That's a whole big megillah for the president. I hope they pick another woman this time if it turns out to be true in the end," Isabelle said. <p> "Yesterday I read that President Connor is cleaning house. She's giving staffers a chance to resign and waiting to see how that offer flies. Wonder what that's all about," Nikki said. <p> "Maggie said when President Connor took office, she listened to the wrong people, and staffers and positions were hired under pressure. She's going to correct that situation, and Maggie thinks Connor waited until Lizzie was installed as chief White House counsel to do anything. Makes sense to me," Annie said. <p> "Well, I'm off to the hot tub," Nikki said as she got painfully to her feet. <p> The others quickly rose and, at the last minute, looked at Annie and asked whose turn it was to clean up. <p> "Myra and I will do it," said Annie. "Run along, girls, so I can pick Myra's brain about that wonderful honeymoon she just returned from five days early." <p> <i>(Continues...)</i> <p> <p> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>GAME OVER</b> by <b>FERN MICHAELS</b> Copyright &copy; 2010 by MRK Productions.
