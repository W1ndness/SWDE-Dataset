Jondalar's family greet him warmly, but they are initially wary of the beautiful young woman he has brought back, with her strange accent and her tame wolf and horses.<br><br>Ayla has much to learn from the Zelandonii and much to teach them. She is intrigued by their clothes, their crafts, and their home, and wants to learn their customs and the ways that they live, so that she will fit in. She is delighted when she meets Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of her people, a fellow healer with whom she can share medicinal skills and knowledge. The Zelandonii are surprised to learn she was found and raised by the Clan, the ones that they call flatheads and think of as animals, and are skeptical when she tells them they are people.<br><br>After the rigors and dangers that have characterized her extraordinary life so far, Ayla yearns for peace and tranquility, to be Jondalar's mate and to have children. But her unique spiritual gifts cannot be ignored, and even as she gives birth to her eagerly-awaited child, she is coming to accept that she has a greater role to play in the destiny of the Zelandonii.</p><h3>Book Magazine</h3><p>Well over a decade since the last volume of her Earth's Children series hulked atop the bestseller lists, Auel has decided to continue the prehistoric saga of that preternaturally resourceful Clan woman, Ayla. After traipsing the glacial wilderness that would become Europe, Ayla and her hunky beau Jondalar arrive to stay with his people, the Zelandonii. Although the Zelandonii are a comparatively advanced tribe&#151;they live in vast limestone caves and have elaborate social rituals&#151;they still fear many of the strange things the two bring with them, like a bow and arrows, the ability to make fire and the animals they have tamed. After Ayla is introduced to seemingly every person in the caves, plans are made for her and Jondalar to be married. Soon the reader realizes that half of the book has passed with just about nothing of import happening. Auel spends so much time with the stories of Ayla's past that it often seems as if this book is meant to be a refresher course instead of a new installment. Auel's research is impressive, but when it comes to character development, the novel is frighteningly juvenile. <BR>

											After a harrowing journey across Europe, Ayla, Jondalar, Whinney, Racer and Wolf have arrived at Jondalar's home, The Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii.  Although this book is a little repetitive and some items are dropped, I still enjoyed it and look forward to the next.  Ayla is such a positive female character.  Her ability to adapt, learn and reinvent herself is amazing.  She has an ability to carry herself with such skill, grace and confidence combined with a sweet, childlike innocence that endears her to others and makes those who try to make fun of her look like fools.  Her healing and magical abilities are a force to be reckoned with and the Zelandoni recognizes what Ayla's potential could mean to the Zelandonii people.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Clan-of-the-Cave-Bear/Jean-M-Auel/e/9780553250428/?pv=y">The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children #1)</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Valley-of-Horses/Jean-M-Auel/e/9780553250534/?pv=y">The Valley of Horses (Earth's Children #2)</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Mammoth-Hunters/Jean-M-Auel/e/9780553280944/?pv=y">The Mammoth Hunters (Earth's Children #3)</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Plains-of-Passage/Jean-M-Auel/e/9780553289411/?pv=y">The Plains of Passage (Earth's Children #4)</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>awesome writing skills<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Auelfan1895">Auelfan1895</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1366915_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780553289428_BK_1_1366915" href="#previewReview_1366915" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>April 24, 2010:

Shortly after earning her MBA in 1976, she was inspired by a story idea so powerful it effectively consumed her for the next few years. In a single creative burst, she conceived a sweeping epic set in prehistoric Europe and featuring a unique heroine: a young Cro-Magnon woman named Ayla, raised as a misfit in a society of inhospitable Neandertals. Auel quit her job, immersed herself in research, and began writing nearly nonstop. <p>    At first, Auel imagined she had the makings of a single book. But when she completed her first draft (more than 450,000 words!), she realized that the story fell naturally into six parts, each one demanding a novel all its own. She worked feverishly on the first installment, revising parts of it as many as 20 and 30 times. Published in 1980, <i>The Clan of the Cave Bear</I> became an instant bestseller, marking the start of the thrilling, totally original Ice Age saga, Earth's Children. <p>    The series owes much of its appeal to Auel's feminist protagonist Ayla, a preternaturally resourceful woman with all the skills and abilities of men but without their warlike qualities. She is the first to ride a horse, tame a wolf, and make fire from flint; she understands the healing power of herbs; and, as the novels progress, she develops mystical, even shamanic powers. Readers were understandably intrigued. <p>    Although Auel writes speculative fiction, she receives high marks for historical accuracy. In the interest of creating an authentic Ice Age setting, her research has led her in interesting, unpredictable directions. She has read extensively, traveled to archeological sites around the world, and learned through various sources how to knapp flint, tan hides, construct snow caves, and prepare medicinal herbs. What emerges in her writing is a precise evocation of time and place that provides a realistic and enthralling backdrop to Ayla's adventures. <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Jean's last name</b> is pronounced like "owl."<p>    <b>Before becoming a bestselling novelist,</b> Jean worked as a clerk, a circuit board designer, a credit manager, and a technical writer. <p>    <b>Jean's extensive research into Ice Age Europe</b> has taken her to prehistoric sites in France, Austria, Czechoslovakia, the Ukraine, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Germany.<p>    <b>When Jean first gazed at the Paleolithic paintings on the walls of Altamira's caves,</b> she was so moved she began to cry. <p>    <b>Jean's advice to aspiring writers of historical fiction:</b> "Write what you love to learn about."  <p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>After their epic journey across Europe, Ayla and Jondalar have reached his home, the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, the old stone age settlement in the region known today as southwest France. Jondalar's family greet him warmly, but they are initially wary of the beautiful young woman he has brought back, with her strange accent and her tame wolf and horses.<br><br>Ayla has much to learn from the Zelandonii and much to teach them. She is intrigued by their clothes, their crafts, and their home, and wants to learn their customs and the ways that they live, so that she will fit in. She is delighted when she meets Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of her people, a fellow healer with whom she can share medicinal skills and knowledge. The Zelandonii are surprised to learn she was found and raised by the Clan, the ones that they call flatheads and think of as animals, and are skeptical when she tells them they are people.<br><br>After the rigors and dangers that have characterized her extraordinary life so far, Ayla yearns for peace and tranquility, to be Jondalar's mate and to have children. But her unique spiritual gifts cannot be ignored, and even as she gives birth to her eagerly-awaited child, she is coming to accept that she has a greater role to play in the destiny of the Zelandonii.</p><h3>Book Magazine</h3><p>Well over a decade since the last volume of her Earth's Children series hulked atop the bestseller lists, Auel has decided to continue the prehistoric saga of that preternaturally resourceful Clan woman, Ayla. After traipsing the glacial wilderness that would become Europe, Ayla and her hunky beau Jondalar arrive to stay with his people, the Zelandonii. Although the Zelandonii are a comparatively advanced tribe&#151;they live in vast limestone caves and have elaborate social rituals&#151;they still fear many of the strange things the two bring with them, like a bow and arrows, the ability to make fire and the animals they have tamed. After Ayla is introduced to seemingly every person in the caves, plans are made for her and Jondalar to be married. Soon the reader realizes that half of the book has passed with just about nothing of import happening. Auel spends so much time with the stories of Ayla's past that it often seems as if this book is meant to be a refresher course instead of a new installment. Auel's research is impressive, but when it comes to character development, the novel is frighteningly juvenile. <BR>
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The tiny minority of authors with the power to sell millions of  novels each time out are a diverse bunch, but they share a  talent for ushering readers into previously closed worlds,  whether they're the top-secret inner sanctums of the American  military or the ancient lands of magic. The best of them craft  terrific stories that tap into universal topics, primal fears  and deep-seated longings. In 1980, Auel became a member of this  elite club. Her first novel, <i>Clan of the Cave Bear</i>, the  exceptional and absorbing account of a bright Cro-Magnon girl  struggling to understand the ways of the Neanderthals who  adopted her, became a huge bestseller and launched the Earth's  Children series, which has sold 34 million copies to date. In  the next three of an intended six volumes, Ayla the Cro-Magnon  girl grew up and put a pretty face on our earliest ancestors, as  Auel explored the mother of all human themes: adapt or die.  After the fourth bestseller, <i>The Plains of Passage</i>, however, 12  years elapsed, and Auel thereby added the protracted  anticipation of her fans to her bestselling mix. Here at last,  beautiful Ayla and her tall, gorgeous Cro-Magnon lover,  Jondalar, arrive in Jondalar's Zelandonii homeland, to live with  his clan in vast caves of what today is France. Travelling with  a pet wolf and two horses, able to speak the strange language of  the "flatheads," Ayla is once again an exotic outsider. Pregnant  with Jondalar's child and as zealous in her desire to help as  she is resourceful and creative as a medicine woman, Ayla soon  wins the respect of the people she wishes to join. Bursting with  hard information about ancient days and awash in steamy sex  (though lacking the high suspense that marked Ayla's debut),  Auel's latest will not only please her legions of fans but will  hit the top of the list, pronto.

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>This is the fifth in a series of six historical novels (first  came Clan of the Cave Bear) that chronicles the life of a  Cro-Magnon female named Ayla. Shelters focuses on Ayla's  acceptance and assimilation into the Zelandonii culture of her  mate, Jondalar; her life, experiences, and surroundings are  described in excruciating detail. The birth of their child is a  rather obvious setup for the next installment. Auel attracts  many readers with her attention to the minutiae of daily  prehistoric life; this same concentration, however, becomes  deadly dull in audio format. Auel explores social issues (e.g.,  poverty, economics, class, etc.) within the historical context,  and because the book fills in the events of the prior four  stories, it can be enjoyed solo. Narrator Sandra Burr's fine  vocal characterizations lend authenticity and stability to the  story. Despite Auel's popularity, her writing is far from  top-notch (events are needlessly and mindlessly repeated); when  combined with the price, this is recommended only for libraries  where demand is high.DDouglas C.

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Fifth volume in the Earth's Children series, begun with <i>Clan of the Cave Bear</i>, with 34 million copies worldwide. It's been 12 years since <i>The Plains of Passage</i> and, although it sold as well as its predecessors, many fans felt a let-down in the series, with the action delayed by hundreds of pages. Here, once again, Auel shows her riches of research, with suspenseless but readable passages of flora, fauna and landscape. Ayla decides to accompany her mate Jondalar back to his home among the Zelandonii, a clan that lives in the caves of massive limestone cliffs and is ruled by Zelandoni, the woman who took Jolandar's virginity. With them they bring their horses, Whinny and Racer, and Ayla's tame wolf, all of which astound the Zelandonii. Ayla is now pregnant and probably the smartest Ice Ager alive, full of wisdom and inner conviction, while blond Jondalar remains ever recessive and needing her moral support as he and Ayla try to fit into the Zelandonii with its new ways and mores. Auel clearly has one more installment to add to her Ice Age saga. Her fans can swim through this behemoth and hope that the next volume doesn't take 12 years.</p><br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-custreview" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="loader" id="BK_9780553289428"><img alt="loading..." title="loading..." src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif"> Loading...</div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-fulldetails" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>Product Details</h3><div class="product-list-info"><div class="col-one"><ul><li class="pubDate">Pub.

They're off limits to the public.<p> But Jean Auel isn't the public. Author of the prehistoric-themed bestsellers <EM>The Clan of the Cave Bear</EM> and its sequels, this former credit manager and circuit board designer has the kind of reputation in the archaeological community that opens doors -- or, in this case, caves. So her visit last summer to one of the world's most important archaeological sites became a media event.<p> With paparazzi and cameras stationed outside, Auel -- along with her husband of 48 years, Ray, and a close friend, Claudine Fisher -- was escorted inside the cool darkness. The group stood silent, as if in a temple. Gazing at the designs left on the walls by some of Europe's earliest human inhabitants, Auel began to cry.<p> Evidence of early human expression can move Auel, the creator of the Ice Age saga known as the Earth's Children series, to tears. Part of the reason is the sense of awe anyone might feel, but the rest has to do with how much Auel identifies with her work.<p> "She's a passionate person," says Fisher, a French professor at Oregon's Portland State University. "And she lives her books."<p> A lot of other people do, too. Since the series began in 1980, <EM>The Clan of the Cave Bear</EM> and its follow-ups have sold more than 34 million copies -- and for many of the series' fans, the books are almost sacred. Literary critics have been less reverent, but the fans don't care. They've created a cult following for the writer and Ayla, Auel's preternaturally capable lead character. They've thrown themselves into the Ice Age world Auel brought to life, preparing prehistoric recipes, setting up campsites like the ones she has described, and learning the mythology she's crafted. They've formed web sites and reading groups, and they've named their daughters after Ayla. They're thrilled that after more than a decade's wait, they've got a new book. With the release of <EM>The Shelters of Stone</EM>, both Ayla (sounds like "Ay-luh") and Auel (sounds like "owl") are back.<p> "I worked my tail off to get done with this book," says Auel, sitting in Portland's Multnomah County Central Library, which, Earth's Children legend has it, was the series' birthplace. Because Auel can afford her own research materials now, she no longer spends as much time here. Properly Pacific Northwestern, the library boasts a Starbucks counter, which Auel has just visited. Sipping a latte, she acknowledges that her fans have grown impatient since <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0553289411"><EM>The Plains of Passage</EM></a>, Book Four in the series, was published in 1990. But Auel has always refused advances and the deadlines that go with them, and this gives her the independence to indulge her penchant for research and to, well, just plain goof off. "I finally put pressure on myself," she says, deciding to hand in a manuscript for Book Five before beginning a trip last summer to see a solar eclipse in Zimbabwe.<p> Auel's love for the natural sciences, along with her attention to minutiae, is much of what captivates the series' readers.... The writer has dug (literally, often) into every aspect of Ayla's world: She's knapped flint -- the process of shaping a piece of flint into a tool, usually by hitting it with a harder rock -- which is more difficult than it sounds. She's built a snow cave and slept in it. She's done survival training, learning how to prepare wild foods and medicinal herbs. She knows how to use a spear-thrower and how to tan a hide the old-fashioned way: by squishing deer brains in a bucket and then rubbing them into the animal's skin to create soft leather. "You know that line about having enough brains to save your hide?" she asks. "Well, it's literally true: Every animal has just enough brains to preserve its hide."<p> When it comes to the charge of inadequate literary quality, Auel is quick to dismiss the dismissals. She finds most literary fiction boring. "So often they write about losers, and to me, oftentimes it's so pretentious," she says. Auel defends her work against accusations of overheated sexuality, claiming the lusting and thrusting is an honest depiction of what was required for the continuation of the species. In other words, she doesn't argue style, she argues substance. Auel's Ayla is a composite of human achievement who embodies Auel's sense of wonder at the natural world....<p> Born in 1936 on the north side of Chicago, Auel was the second daughter of a housewife mother and a father who worked variously as a house painter, a wallpaper hanger, and a railroad switchman. Jean and Ray married when she was 18, and by the time she was 25, the couple had moved to Portland and had five children. ("Medical science came to my rescue," she notes with a rare display of humor. "They invented the pill.") She took night jobs as a keypunch operator so that she and her husband could trade off child-care duties. In her late 20s, with Ray pursuing a degree, she wanted to go to college, too.... She qualified and went on to enroll in a class at Portland State College. Over the next six years, Auel ended up accumulating a grab bag of credits but no bachelor's degree. (Today, she holds four honorary degrees.)<p> By the mid-'70s, the Auels had three daughters in college. Although Jean's salary was important to the family budget, she was unhappy with the limited opportunities for women at her company. In late 1976, she quit. At 40, Auel had no specific plan. She had never written anything more than technical manuals for Tektronix and some poetry that had never been published. Then, one night in January 1977, the idea popped into her head to write a short story about a young woman who takes care of an old man with a crippled arm. She pounded out 10 or 12 pages of plot with a primitive setting.<p> A few days later, she drove downtown with her youngest son, Marshall. They agreed to meet later, and she headed for the Multnomah library -- and that's where the legend starts. Marshall found her there four hours later, elbow-deep in books about Neanderthals and woolly mammoths. Auel realized she was no longer writing a short story, or even a novel: She had more in mind. Over the next half year, working 14 hours a day, she generated 450,000 words.<p> Since <EM>Clan</EM> appeared, she has spoken to serious scholars at places like the Smithsonian, and she's a regular at meetings of the Society for American Archaeology. When she built a sprawling 14,000-square-foot home on 50 acres near Portland, she envisioned it as a gathering place for the experts she admires. In fact, in April 1993, she sponsored the first (and only) Oregon Archaeological Retreat there.<p> Auel has done a great deal to stimulate interest in the field, says Olga Soffer, one of the retreat's organizers and a professor at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. "When you ask first-time students why they're taking your class," says Soffer, who is a leading American authority on the Upper Paleolithic peoples of central and eastern Europe, "they often say it's because they've read something by Jean Auel."<p> [Auel has] already completed the outline for Book Six, the final installment in her Earth's Children series. She's coy about it. But her trip to Spain last summer is something of a tip-off about where Ayla goes next, and Auel reveals that her heroine will also travel to the Atlantic Ocean. The writer recently prepared for this part of Ayla's itinerary, working out how her <i>&uuml;ber</i>-woman will get food, by raking cockles off the ocean floor during a class at the Oregon Coast.<p> Will Ayla die in the last book? "I'm not telling," Auel says quickly, although she will admit to an increasing sense of her own mortality.<p> Auel doesn't foresee the Earth's Children series -- or even fiction set in the Ice Age -- as her one and only statement as a writer. When she describes her trip to &Ccedil;atalh&#252;y&#252;k -- an archaeological site in Turkey from the Neolithic age that had a remarkable population of 5,000 some 10,000 years ago -- it's with the same enthusiasm she has in talking about the famous caves at Lascaux and Altamira. She says she has "150 ideas for other stories" but sees particular possibilities from this period: the era that saw the beginning of agriculture. For Auel, the thought of leaving Ayla behind creates neither sadness nor anxiety. "I've always said I can do whatever I want to do," she says. And like her preternaturally talented heroine, Jean Auel is always prepared to cover new ground. (<EM>Ellen Emry Heltzel</EM>)
<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P>People were gathering on the limestone ledge, looking down at them warily. No one made a gesture of welcome, and some held spears in positions of readiness if not actual threat. The young woman could almost feel their edgy fear. She watched from the bottom of the path as more people crowded together on the ledge, staring down, many more than she thought there would be. She had seen that reluctance to greet them from other people they had met on their Journey. It&#8217;s not just them, she told herself, it&#8217;s always that way in the beginning. But she felt uneasy.<br><br>The tall man jumped down from the back of the young stallion. He was neither reluctant nor uneasy, but he hesitated for a moment, holding the stallion&#8217;s halter rope. He turned around and noticed that she was hanging back. &#8220;Ayla, will you hold Racer&#8217;s rope? He seems nervous,&#8221; he said, then looked up at the ledge. &#8220;I guess they do, too.&#8221;<br><br>She nodded, lifted her leg over, slid down from the mare&#8217;s back, and took the rope. In addition to the tension of seeing strange people, the young brown horse was still agitated around his dam. She was no longer in heat, but residual odors still clung from her encounter with the herd stallion. Ayla held the halter rope of the brown male close, but gave the dun-yellow mare a long lead, and stood between them. She considered giving Whinney her head; her horse was more accustomed to large groups of strangers now, and was not usually high-strung, but she seemed nervous, too. That throng of people would make anyone nervous.<br><br>When the wolf appeared, Ayla heard sounds of agitation and alarm from the ledge in front of the cave&#151;if it could be called a cave. She&#8217;d never seen one quite like it. Wolf pressed against the side of her leg and moved somewhat in front of her, suspiciously defensive; she could feel the vibration of his barely audible growl. He was much more guarded around strangers now than he had been when they began their long Journey a year before, but he had been little more than a puppy then, and he had become more protective of her after some perilous experiences.<br><br>As the man strode up the incline toward the apprehensive people, he showed no fear, but the woman was glad for the opportunity to wait behind and observe them before she had to meet them. She&#8217;d been expecting&#151;dreading&#151;this moment for more than a year, and first impressions were important . . . on both sides.<br><br>Though others held back, a young woman rushed toward him. Jondalar recognized his younger sister immediately, though the pretty girl had blossomed into a beautiful young woman during the five years of his absence.<br><br>&#8220;Jondalar! I knew it was you!&#8221; she said, flinging herself at him. &#8220;You finally came home!&#8221;<br><br>He gave her a big hug, then picked her up and swung her around in his enthusiasm. &#8220;Folara, I am so happy to see you!&#8221; He put her down and looked at her at arms&#8217; length. &#8220;But you&#8217;ve grown. You were just a girl when I left; now you&#8217;re a beautiful woman . . . just as I always knew you&#8217;d be,&#8221; he said, with slightly more than a brotherly glint in his eye.<br><br>She smiled at him, looked into his unbelievably vivid blue eyes and was drawn by their magnetism. She felt herself flush, not from his compliment, although that&#8217;s what those standing nearby thought, but from the rush of attraction she felt for the man, brother or not, whom she had not seen for many years. She had heard stories of her handsome big brother with the unusual eyes who could charm any woman, but her memory was of a tall adoring playmate who was willing to go along with any game or activity she wanted to play. This was the first time as a young woman that she was exposed to the full effect of his unconscious charisma. Jondalar noticed her reaction and smiled warmly at her sweet confusion.<br><br>She glanced away toward the bottom of the path near the small river. &#8220;Who is that woman, Jond&#233;?&#8221; she asked, &#8220;and where did the animals come from? Animals run away from people; why don&#8217;t those animals run away from her? Is she a Zelandoni? Has she Called them?&#8221; Then she frowned. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Thonolan?&#8221; She took a sharp breath at the look of pain that tightened Jondalar&#8217;s brow.<br><br>&#8220;Thonolan travels the next world now, Folara,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I wouldn&#8217;t be here if it weren&#8217;t for that woman.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Oh, Jond&#233;! What happened?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story, and this is not the time to tell it,&#8221; he said, but he had to smile at the name she called him. It was her personal nickname for him. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard that name since I left. Now I know I&#8217;m home. How is everyone, Folara? Is Mother all right? And Willamar?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;They&#8217;re both fine. Mother gave us a scare a couple of years ago. But Zelandoni worked her special magic, and she seems fine now. Come and see for yourself,&#8221; she said, taking his hand and starting to lead him the rest of the way up the path.<br><br>Jondalar turned and waved at Ayla, trying to let her know that he would be back soon. He hated leaving her there alone with the animals, but he needed to see his mother, to see for himself that she was all right. That &#8220;scare&#8221; bothered him, and he needed to talk to people about the animals. He and Ayla had both come to realize how strange and frightening it was to most people to see animals that did not run away from them.<br><br>People knew animals. All the people they had met on their Journey hunted them, and most honored or paid homage to them or their spirits in one way or another. Animals had been observed carefully for as long as anyone could remember. People knew the environments they favored and the foods they liked, their migration patterns and seasonal movements, their birthing periods and rutting schedules. But no one had ever tried to touch a living, breathing animal in a friendly way. No one had ever tried to tie a rope around the head of any animal and lead it around. No one had ever tried to tame an animal, or even imagined that it could be done.<br><br>As pleased as these people were to see a kinsman return from a long Journey&#151;especially one that few ever expected to see again&#151;the tame animals were such an unknown phenomenon that their first reaction was fear. It was so strange, so inexplicable, so far beyond their experience or imagination that it could not be natural. It had to be unnatural, supernatural. The only thing that kept many of them from running and hiding, or attempting to kill the fearsome animals, was that Jondalar, whom they knew, had arrived with them, and he was striding up the path from Wood River with his sister, looking perfectly normal under the bright light of the sun.<br><br>Folara had shown some courage rushing forward the way she had, but she was young and had the fearlessness of youth. And she was so pleased to see her brother, who had always been a special favorite, that she couldn&#8217;t wait. Jondalar would never do anything to harm her and he didn&#8217;t fear the animals.<br><br>Ayla watched from the foot of the path while people surrounded Jondalar, welcoming him with smiles, hugs, kisses, pats, handshakes using both hands, and many words. She noticed a hugely fat woman, a brown-haired man whom Jondalar hugged, and an older woman whom he greeted warmly and then kept his arm around. Probably his mother, she thought, and wondered what the woman would think of her.<br><br>These people were his family, his kin, his friends, people he had grown up with. She was a stranger, a disturbing stranger who brought animals and who knew what other threatening foreign ways and outrageous ideas. Would they accept her? What if they didn&#8217;t? She couldn&#8217;t go back, her people lived more than a year&#8217;s travel to the east. Jondalar had promised that he would leave with her if she wanted&#151;or was forced&#151;to go, but that was before he saw everyone, before he was greeted so warmly. How would he feel now?<br><br>She felt a nudge from behind and reached up to stroke Whinney&#8217;s sturdy neck, grateful that her friend had reminded her that she was not alone. When she lived in the valley, after she left the Clan, for a long time the horse had been her only companion. She hadn&#8217;t noticed the slack in Whinney&#8217;s rope as the horse moved closer to her, but she gave Racer a bit more lead. The mare and her offspring usually found friendship and comfort in each other, but when the mare came into season it had disturbed their usual pattern.<br><br>More people&#151;how could there be so many?&#151;were looking in her direction, and Jondalar was talking earnestly with the brown-haired man, then waved at her and smiled. When he started back down, he was followed by the young woman, the brown-haired man, and a few others. Ayla took a deep breath and waited.<br><br>As they approached, the wolf&#8217;s growl became louder. Ayla reached down to hold him close to her. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Wolf,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just Jondalar&#8217;s kin.&#8221; Her calming touch was a signal to him to stop growling, not to appear too threatening. The signal had been difficult to teach him, but worth the effort, especially now, she thought. She wished she knew of a touch that would calm her.<br><br>The group with Jondalar stopped a short distance away, trying not to show their trepidation or to stare at the animals that openly stared at them and held their place even when strange people approached them. Jondalar stepped into the breach.<br><br>&#8220;I think we should start with formal introductions, Joharran,&#8221; he said, looking at the brown-haired man.<br><br>As Ayla dropped both halter ropes in preparation for a formal introduction, which required contact with both hands, the horses stepped back, but the wolf stayed. She noticed the glint of fear in the man&#8217;s eye, although she doubted that this man was afraid of much, and glanced at Jondalar, wondering if he had a reason for wanting formal introductions immediately. She looked closely at the unfamiliar man and was suddenly reminded of Brun, the leader of the clan that she grew up with. Powerful, proud, intelligent, competent, there was little he had feared&#151;except the world of the spirits.<br><br>&#8220;Ayla, this is Joharran, Leader of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, son of Marthona, former Leader of the Ninth Cave, born to the hearth of Joconan, former Leader of the Ninth Cave,&#8221; the tall blond man said with seriousness. Then he grinned. &#8220;Not to mention brother of Jondalar, Traveler to Distant Lands.&#8221;<br><br>There were a few quick smiles. His comment relieved the tension somewhat. Strictly, in a formal introduction, a person could give the entire list of their names and ties to validate their status&#151;all their own designations, titles and accomplishments, and all their kin and their relationships, along with their titles and accomplishments&#151;and some did. But as a matter of practice, except in the most ceremonial of circumstances, just the primary ones were mentioned. It was not uncommon, however, for young people, especially brothers, to make jocular additions to the long and sometimes tedious recitation of one&#8217;s kinships, and Jondalar was reminding his brother of past years, before he was burdened with the responsibilities of leadership.<br><br>&#8220;Joharran, this is Ayla of the Mamutoi, Member of the Lion Camp, Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth, Chosen by the Spirit of the Cave Lion, and Protected by the Cave Bear.&#8221;<br><br>The brown-haired man crossed the distance between himself and the young woman and held out both hands, palms up, in the understood gesture of welcome and openhanded friendship. He did not recognize any of her ties, and he wasn&#8217;t entirely sure which were most important.<br><br>&#8220;In the name of Doni, the Great Earth Mother, I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi, Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth,&#8221; he said.<br><br>Ayla took both his hands. &#8220;In the name of Mut, Great Mother of All, I greet you, Joharran, Leader of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii,&#8221; she said, then smiled. &#8220;And brother of the traveler Jondalar.&#8221;<br><br>Joharran noticed first that she spoke his language well, but with an unusual accent, and then he became conscious of her strange clothing and her foreign look, but when she smiled, he smiled back. Partly because she had showed her understanding of Jondalar&#8217;s remark and let Joharran know that his brother was important to her, but mostly because he could not resist her smile.<br><br>Ayla was an attractive woman by anyone&#8217;s standards&#58; she was tall, had a firm, well-shaped body, long, dark blond hair that tended to wave, clear blue-gray eyes, and fine features, though of a slightly different character than those of Zelandonii women. But when she smiled, it was as if the sun had cast a special beam on her that lit each feature from within. She seemed to glow with such stunning beauty, Joharran caught his breath. Jondalar had always said her smile was remarkable, and he grinned seeing that his brother was not immune to it.<br><br>Then Joharran noticed the stallion prance nervously toward Jondalar, and he eyed the wolf. &#8220;Jondalar tells me we need to make some . . . ah . . . accommodation for these animals . . . somewhere nearby, I presume.&#8221; Not too near, he thought.<br><br>&#8220;The horses just need a field with grass, near water, but we need to tell people that they shouldn&#8217;t try to get close to them in the beginning unless Jondalar or I am with them. Whinney and Racer are nervous around people until they get used to them,&#8221; Ayla said.<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that will be a problem,&#8221; Joharran said, catching the movement of Whinney&#8217;s tail and eyeing her. &#8220;They can stay here, if this small valley is appropriate.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;This will be fine,&#8221; Jondalar said. &#8220;Though we may move them upstream, out of the way a little.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Wolf is accustomed to sleeping near me,&#8221; Ayla continued. She noticed Joharran&#8217;s frown. &#8220;He&#8217;s become quite protective and might cause a commotion if he can&#8217;t be close by.&#8221;<br><br>She could see his resemblance to Jondalar particularly in his forehead knotted with worry, and wanted to smile. But Joharran was seriously concerned. This was not a time for smiles, even if his expression gave her a feeling of warm familiarity.<br><br>Jondalar, too, had seen his brother&#8217;s worried frown. &#8220;I think this would be a good time to introduce Joharran to Wolf,&#8221; he said.<br><br>Joharran&#8217;s eyes flew open in near panic, but before he could object, she reached for his hand as she bent down beside the meat eater. She put her arm around the large wolf&#8217;s neck to settle an incipient growl&#151;even she could smell the man&#8217;s fear, so she was sure Wolf could.<br><br>&#8220;Let him smell your hand, first,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s Wolf&#8217;s formal introduction.&#8221; The wolf had learned from previous experience that it was important to Ayla for him to accept within his pack of humans the people she introduced to him in this way. He didn&#8217;t like the smell of fear, but sniffed the man to become familiar with him.<br><br>&#8220;Have you ever really felt the fur of a living wolf, Joharran?&#8221; she asked, looking up at him. &#8220;If you notice, it&#8217;s a little coarse,&#8221; she said, leading his hand to feel the animal&#8217;s rather shaggy neck fur. &#8220;He&#8217;s still shedding and itchy, and he loves to be scratched behind the ears,&#8221; she continued, showing him how.<br><br>Joharran felt the fur, but was more aware of the warmth, and suddenly realized this was a living wolf! And it didn&#8217;t seem to mind being touched.<br><br>Ayla observed that his hand was not as stiff, and that he actually attempted to rub the place she indicated. &#8220;Let him smell your hand again.&#8221;<br><br>When Joharran brought his hand around toward the wolf&#8217;s nose, he widened his eyes again, with surprise. &#8220;That wolf licked me!&#8221; he said, not sure if it was in preparation for something better&#151;or worse. Then he saw Wolf lick Ayla&#8217;s face, and she seemed very pleased about it.<br><br>&#8220;Yes, you were good, Wolf,&#8221; she said, smiling, as she fondled him and roughed up his mane. Then she stood up and patted the front of her shoulders. The wolf jumped up, put his paws on the place she had indicated, and as she exposed her throat, he licked her neck, then took her chin and jaw in his mouth with a rumbling growl, but with great gentleness.<br><br>Jondalar noticed the gasps of astonishment from Joharran and the others and realized how frightening the familiar act of wolfish affection must seem to people who didn&#8217;t understand. His brother looked at him, his expression both fearful and amazed. &#8220;What&#8217;s he doing to her?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Are you sure that&#8217;s all right?&#8221; Folara asked at nearly the same time. She could no longer keep still. The other people were making indecisive nervous movements as well.<br><br>Jondalar smiled. &#8220;Yes, Ayla is fine. He loves her; he would never hurt her. That&#8217;s how wolves show affection. It took me a while to get used to it, too, and I&#8217;ve known Wolf as long as she has, ever since he was a fuzzy little cub.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;That&#8217;s no cub! That&#8217;s a big wolf! That&#8217;s the biggest wolf I&#8217;ve ever seen!&#8221; Joharran said. &#8220;He could tear her throat out!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes. He could tear her throat out. I&#8217;ve seen him tear a woman&#8217;s throat out . . . a woman who was trying to kill Ayla,&#8221; Jondalar said. &#8220;Wolf protects her.&#8221;<br><br>The Zelandonii who were watching breathed a collective sigh of relief when the wolf got down and stood by Ayla&#8217;s side again with his mouth open and his tongue hanging out the side, showing his teeth. Wolf had that look that Jondalar thought of as his wolf grin, as though he was pleased with himself.<br><br>&#8220;Does he do that all the time?&#8221; Folara asked. &#8220;To . . . anyone?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No,&#8221; Jondalar said. &#8220;Only to Ayla, and sometimes me, if he&#8217;s feeling particularly happy, and only if we allow it. He&#8217;s well-behaved, he won&#8217;t harm anyone . . . unless Ayla is threatened.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;What about children?&#8221; Folara asked. &#8220;Wolves often go after the weak and the young.&#8221; At the mention of children, looks of concern appeared on the faces of the people standing nearby.<br><br>&#8220;Wolf loves children,&#8221; Ayla quickly explained, &#8220;and he is very protective toward them, particularly very young or weak ones. He was raised with the children of the Lion Camp.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;There was a very weak and sickly boy, who belonged to the Lion Hearth,&#8221; Jondalar contributed. &#8220;You should have seen them play together. Wolf was always careful around him.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very unusual animal,&#8221; another man said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to believe a wolf could behave so . . . unwolflike.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Solaban,&#8221; Jondalar said. &#8220;He does behave in ways that seem very unwolflike to people, but if we were wolves we wouldn&#8217;t think so. He was raised with people and Ayla says he thinks of people as his pack. He treats people as though they were wolves.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Does he hunt?&#8221; the man called Solaban wanted to know.<br><br>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Ayla said. &#8220;Sometimes he hunts alone, for himself, and sometimes he helps us hunt.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;How does he know what he should hunt and what he shouldn&#8217;t?&#8221; Folara asked. &#8220;Like those horses.&#8221;<br><br>Ayla smiled. &#8220;The horses are part of his pack, too. You notice they are not afraid of him. And he never hunts people. Otherwise, he can hunt any animal he wants, unless I tell him not to.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;And if you say no, he doesn&#8217;t?&#8221; another man asked.<br><br>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Rushemar,&#8221; Jondalar affirmed.<br><br>The man shook his head in wonder. It was hard to believe anyone could have such control over a powerful hunting animal.<br><br>&#8220;Well, Joharran,&#8221; Jondalar said. &#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s safe enough to bring Ayla and Wolf up?&#8221;<br><br>The man thought for a moment, then nodded. &#8220;However, if there is any trouble . . .&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be, Joharran.&#8221; Jondalar turned to Ayla. &#8220;My mother has invited us to stay with her. Folara still lives with her, but she has her own room, and so do Marthona and Willamar. He&#8217;s gone on a trading mission now. She has offered her central living space to us. Of course, we could stay with Zelandoni at the visitors hearth, if you&#8217;d rather.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I would be pleased to stay with your mother, Jondalar,&#8221; Ayla said.<br><br>&#8220;Good! Mother also suggested that we wait with most formal introductions until we get settled in. It isn&#8217;t as though I need to be introduced, and there&#8217;s no point in repeating everything to each one when we can do it all at once.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;We&#8217;re already planning a welcoming feast for tonight,&#8221; Folara said. &#8220;And probably another one later, for all the nearby Caves.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I appreciate your mother&#8217;s thoughtfulness, Jondalar. It would be easier to meet everyone at once, but you might introduce me to this young woman,&#8221; Ayla said.<br><br>Folara smiled.<br><br>&#8220;Of course, I was planning to,&#8221; Jondalar said. &#8220;Ayla, this is my sister Folara, Blessed of Doni, of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii; Daughter of Marthona, former Leader of the Ninth Cave; born to the hearth of Willamar, Traveler and Trade Master; sister of Joharran, Leader of the Ninth Cave; sister of Jondalar . . .&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;She knows about you, Jondalar, and I&#8217;ve already heard her names and ties,&#8221; Folara said, impatient with the formalities, then held out both hands toward Ayla. &#8220;In the name of Doni, the Great Earth Mother, I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi, Friend of Horses and Wolves.&#8221;<br><br>The crowd of people standing on the sunny stone ledge quickly moved back when they saw the woman and the wolf start up the path along with Jondalar and the small group accompanying them. One or two took a step closer while a few others craned their necks around them. When they reached the stone ledge Ayla got her first view of the living space of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii. The sight surprised her.<br><br>Though she knew the word &#8220;Cave&#8221; in the name of Jondalar&#8217;s home did not refer to a place, but to the group of people who lived there, and the formation she saw was not a cave, not as she had thought of one. A cave was a dark chamber or series of them within a rock face or cliff, or underground, with an opening to the outside. The living space of these people was the area beneath a huge overhanging shelf jutting out of the limestone cliff, an abri, that provided protection from rain or snow, but was open to daylight.<br><br>The high cliffs of the region had once been the floor beneath the surface of an ancient sea. As the calcareous shells of crustaceans that lived in the sea were discarded, they built up on the floor, and eventually became calcium carbonate&#151;limestone. During certain periods of time, for a variety of reasons, some of the deposited shells created thick layers of limestone that were harder than others. When the earth shifted, exposing the sea floor until it eventually became cliffs, the weathering processes of wind and water cut into the relatively softer stone more easily, gouging out deep spaces and leaving ledges of the harder stone between.<br><br>Although the cliffs were also riddled with caves, which were common in limestone, these unusual shelflike formations created shelters of stone that made exceptionally good living sites and had been used as such for a great many thousands of years.<br><br>Jondalar led Ayla toward the older woman she had seen from the foot of the path. The woman was tall and dignified in her bearing as she waited patiently for them. Her hair, more gray than light brown, was pulled back from her face into one long braid, which was coiled at the back of her head. Her clear, direct, appraising eyes were also gray.<br><br>When they reached her, Jondalar began the formal introduction. &#8220;Ayla, this is Marthona, former Leader of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii; daughter of Jemara; born to the hearth of Rabanar; mated to Willamar, Trade Master of the Ninth Cave; Mother of Joharran, Leader of the Ninth Cave; Mother of Folara, Blessed of Doni; Mother of . . .&#8221; He started to say Thonolan, hesitated, then quickly filled in, &#8220;Jondalar, Returned Traveler.&#8221; Then he turned to his mother.<br><br>&#8220;Marthona, this is Ayla of the Lion Camp of the Mamutoi, Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth, Chosen by the Spirit of the Cave Lion, Protected by the Spirit of the Cave Bear.&#8221;<br><br>Marthona held out her two hands. &#8220;In the name of Doni, the Great Earth Mother, I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;In the name of Mut, Great Mother of All, I greet you, Marthona of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, and mother of Jondalar,&#8221; Ayla said as they joined hands.<br><br>Marthona heard Ayla&#8217;s words, wondered at her strange speech mannerism, noted how well she spoke in spite of it, and thought it was either a minor speech defect or the accent of a completely unfamiliar language from a very distant place. She smiled. &#8220;You have come a long way, Ayla, left all you knew and loved behind. If you had not, I don&#8217;t think I would have Jondalar back home. I am grateful to you for that. I hope you will soon feel at home here, and I will do all I can to help you.&#8221;<br><br>Ayla knew Jondalar&#8217;s mother was sincere. Her directness and honesty were genuine; she was glad to have her son back. Ayla was relieved and touched by Marthona&#8217;s welcome. &#8220;I have looked forward to meeting you since Jondalar first spoke of you . . . but I have been a little afraid, too,&#8221; she replied with a similar directness and honesty.<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you. I would have found it very difficult in your place. Come, let me show you where you can put your things. You must be tired and would like to rest before the welcoming celebration tonight,&#8221; Marthona said, starting to lead them toward the area under the overhang. Suddenly Wolf started whining, yelped a little &#8220;puppy bark,&#8221; and stretched his front paws out with his back end and tail up in a playful posture.<br><br>Jondalar was startled. &#8220;What is he doing?&#8221;<br><br>Ayla looked at Wolf, rather surprised as well. The animal repeated his gestures, and suddenly she smiled. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s trying to get Marthona&#8217;s attention,&#8221; Ayla said. &#8220;He thinks she didn&#8217;t notice him, and I think he wants to be introduced.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;And I want to meet him, too,&#8221; Marthona said.<br><br>&#8220;You don&#8217;t fear him!&#8221; Ayla said. &#8220;And he knows it!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I watched. I didn&#8217;t see anything to fear,&#8221; she said, extending her hand toward the wolf. He sniffed her hand, licked it, and whined again.<br><br>&#8220;I think Wolf wants you to touch him; he does love attention from people he likes,&#8221; Ayla said.<br><br>&#8220;You do like that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; the older woman said as she stroked him. &#8220;Wolf? Is that what you called him?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s just the Mamutoi word for &#8216;wolf.&#8217; It seemed like the right name for him,&#8221; Ayla explained.<br><br>&#8220;But, I&#8217;ve never seen him take to anyone so fast,&#8221; Jondalar said, looking at his mother with awe.<br><br>&#8220;Nor have I,&#8221; Ayla said, watching Marthona with the wolf. &#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s just happy to meet someone who&#8217;s not afraid of him.&#8221;<br><br>As they walked into the shade of the overhanging stone, Ayla felt an immediate cooling of temperature. For a heartbeat, she shivered with a chill of fear and glanced up at the huge shelf of stone jutting out of the cliff wall, wondering if it could collapse. But when her eyes grew accustomed to the dimmer light, she was astonished by more than the physical formation of Jondalar&#8217;s home. The space under the rock shelter was huge, much larger than she had imagined.<br><br>She had seen similar overhangs in the cliffs along this river on their way here, some obviously inhabited, though none seemed quite as sizable as this one. Everyone in the entire region knew of the immense rock shelter and the great number of people it housed. The Ninth Cave was the largest of all the communities that called themselves Zelandonii.<br><br>Clustered together at the eastern end of the protected space, along the back wall and freestanding in the middle, were individual structures, many quite large, made partly of stone and partly of wooden frames covered with hides. The hides were decorated with beautifully rendered pictures of animals and various abstract symbols painted in black and many vivid shades of red, yellow, and brown. The structures were arranged in a west-facing curve around an open space near the center of the area covered by the overhanging stone shelf, which was filled with a confusion of objects and people.<br><br>As Ayla looked more closely, what at first had struck her as a melange of rich clutter was resolving itself into areas dedicated to different tasks, often near to related tasks. It only seemed confusing initially only because so many activities were going on.<br><br>She saw hides being cured in frames, and long shafts of spears, apparently in the process of being straightened, leaning against a crosspiece supported by two posts. Baskets in different stages of completion were stacked in another place, and thongs were drying stretched between pairs of bone posts. Long skeins of cordage hung from pegs pounded into crossbeams above unfinished nets stretched across a frame, and loosely woven netting in bundles on the ground. Skins, some dyed various colors, including many shades of red, were cut into pieces and nearby, partially assembled articles of clothing were hanging.<br><br>She recognized most of the crafts, but near the clothing was an activity that was entirely unfamiliar. A frame held many strands of thin cord vertically, with a design partially formed from the material woven horizontally across them. She wanted to go over and look closer, and promised herself she would, later. Pieces of wood, stone, bone, antler, and mammoth ivory were in other places, carved into implements&#151;ladles, spoons, bowls, tongs, weapons&#151;most of them with carved and sometimes painted decorations. There were also small sculptures and carvings that were not utensils or tools. They seemed to be made for themselves or some purpose of which she wasn&#8217;t aware.<br><br>She saw vegetables and herbs hanging high from large frames with many cross pieces, and lower to the ground, meat drying on racks. Somewhat away from other activities was an area scattered with sharp stone chips; for people like Jondalar, she thought, flintknappers who made tools, knives, and spear points.<br><br>And everywhere she looked, she saw people. The community that lived under the spacious rock shelter was of a size to match the space. Ayla had grown up in a clan of less than thirty people; at the Clan Gathering, which occurred once every seven years, two hundred people came together for a short period, a huge assembly to her then. Though the Mamutoi Summer Meeting drew a much greater number, the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii alone comprised of over two hundred individuals living together at this one place, was larger than the entire Clan Gathering!<br><br>Ayla didn&#8217;t know how many people were standing around watching them, but she was reminded of the time she had walked with Brun&#8217;s clan into that congregation of clans and felt all of them looking at her. They had tried to be unobtrusive, but the people who were staring as Marthona led Jondalar, Ayla, and a wolf to her living place weren&#8217;t so polite about it. They didn&#8217;t try to look down or glance away. She wondered if she would ever get used to living with so many people close by all the time; she wondered if she wanted to.<br><br><br><a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>People were gathering on the limestone ledge, looking down at them warily. No one made a gesture of welcome, and some held spears in positions of readiness if not actual threat. The young woman could almost feel their edgy fear. She watched from the bottom of the path as more people crowded together on the ledge, staring down, many more than she thought there would be. She had seen that reluctance to greet them from other people they had met on their Journey. It's not just them, she told herself, it's always that way in the beginning. But she felt uneasy.</p>
<p>The tall man jumped down from the back of the young stallion. He was neither reluctant nor uneasy, but he hesitated for a moment, holding the stallion's halter rope. He turned around and noticed that she was hanging back. "Ayla, will you hold Racer's rope? He seems nervous," he said, then looked up at the ledge. "I guess they do, too."</p>
<p>She nodded, lifted her leg over, slid down from the mare's back, and took the rope. In addition to the tension of seeing strange people, the young brown horse was still agitated around his dam. She was no longer in heat, but residual odors still clung from her encounter with the herd stallion. Ayla held the halter rope of the brown male close, but gave the dun-yellow mare a long lead, and stood between them. She considered giving Whinney her head; her horse was more accustomed to large groups of strangers now, and was not usually high-strung, but she seemed nervous, too. That throng of people would make anyone nervous.</p>
<p>When the wolf appeared, Ayla heard sounds of agitation and alarm from the ledge in front of the cave--if it could be called a cave. She'd never seen one quite like it. Wolf pressed against the side of her leg and moved somewhat in front of her, suspiciously defensive; she could feel the vibration of his barely audible growl. He was much more guarded around strangers now than he had been when they began their long Journey a year before, but he had been little more than a puppy then, and he had become more protective of her after some perilous experiences.</p>
<p>As the man strode up the incline toward the apprehensive people, he showed no fear, but the woman was glad for the opportunity to wait behind and observe them before she had to meet them. She'd been expecting--dreading--this moment for more than a year, and first impressions were important . . . on both sides.</p>
<p>Though others held back, a young woman rushed toward him. Jondalar recognized his younger sister immediately, though the pretty girl had blossomed into a beautiful young woman during the five years of his absence.</p>
<p>"Jondalar! I knew it was you!" she said, flinging herself at him. "You finally came home!"</p>
<p>He gave her a big hug, then picked her up and swung her around in his enthusiasm. "Folara, I am so happy to see you!" He put her down and looked at her at arms' length. "But you've grown. You were just a girl when I left; now you're a beautiful woman . . . just as I always knew you'd be," he said, with slightly more than a brotherly glint in his eye.</p>
<p>She smiled at him, looked into his unbelievably vivid blue eyes and was drawn by their magnetism. She felt herself flush, not from his compliment, although that's what those standing nearby thought, but from the rush of attraction she felt for the man, brother or not, whom she had not seen for many years. She had heard stories of her handsome big brother with the unusual eyes who could charm any woman, but her memory was of a tall adoring playmate who was willing to go along with any game or activity she wanted to play. This was the first time as a young woman that she was exposed to the full effect of his unconscious charisma. Jondalar noticed her reaction and smiled warmly at her sweet confusion.</p>
<p>She glanced away toward the bottom of the path near the small river. "Who is that woman, Jond�?" she asked, "and where did the animals come from? Animals run away from people; why don't those animals run away from her? Is she a Zelandoni? Has she Called them?" Then she frowned. "Where's Thonolan?" She took a sharp breath at the look of pain that tightened Jondalar's brow.</p>
<p>"Thonolan travels the next world now, Folara," he said, "and I wouldn't be here if it weren't for that woman."</p>
<p>"Oh, Jond�! What happened?"</p>
<p>"It's a long story, and this is not the time to tell it," he said, but he had to smile at the name she called him. It was her personal nickname for him. "I haven't heard that name since I left. Now I know I'm home. How is everyone, Folara? Is Mother all right? And Willamar?"</p>
<p>"They're both fine. Mother gave us a scare a couple of years ago. But Zelandoni worked her special magic, and she seems fine now. Come and see for yourself," she said, taking his hand and starting to lead him the rest of the way up the path.</p>
<p>Jondalar turned and waved at Ayla, trying to let her know that he would be back soon. He hated leaving her there alone with the animals, but he needed to see his mother, to see for himself that she was all right. That "scare" bothered him, and he needed to talk to people about the animals. He and Ayla had both come to realize how strange and frightening it was to most people to see animals that did not run away from them.</p>
<p>People knew animals. All the people they had met on their Journey hunted them, and most honored or paid homage to them or their spirits in one way or another. Animals had been observed carefully for as long as anyone could remember. People knew the environments they favored and the foods they liked, their migration patterns and seasonal movements, their birthing periods and rutting schedules. But no one had ever tried to touch a living, breathing animal in a friendly way. No one had ever tried to tie a rope around the head of any animal and lead it around. No one had ever tried to tame an animal, or even imagined that it could be done.</p>
<p>As pleased as these people were to see a kinsman return from a long Journey--especially one that few ever expected to see again--the tame animals were such an unknown phenomenon that their first reaction was fear. It was so strange, so inexplicable, so far beyond their experience or imagination that it could not be natural. It had to be unnatural, supernatural. The only thing that kept many of them from running and hiding, or attempting to kill the fearsome animals, was that Jondalar, whom they knew, had arrived with them, and he was striding up the path from Wood River with his sister, looking perfectly normal under the bright light of the sun.</p>
<p>Folara had shown some courage rushing forward the way she had, but she was young and had the fearlessness of youth. And she was so pleased to see her brother, who had always been a special favorite, that she couldn't wait. Jondalar would never do anything to harm her and he didn't fear the animals.</p>
<p>Ayla watched from the foot of the path while people surrounded Jondalar, welcoming him with smiles, hugs, kisses, pats, handshakes using both hands, and many words. She noticed a hugely fat woman, a brown-haired man whom Jondalar hugged, and an older woman whom he greeted warmly and then kept his arm around. Probably his mother, she thought, and wondered what the woman would think of her.</p>
<p>These people were his family, his kin, his friends, people he had grown up with. She was a stranger, a disturbing stranger who brought animals and who knew what other threatening foreign ways and outrageous ideas. Would they accept her? What if they didn't? She couldn't go back, her people lived more than a year's travel to the east. Jondalar had promised that he would leave with her if she wanted--or was forced--to go, but that was before he saw everyone, before he was greeted so warmly. How would he feel now?</p>
<p>She felt a nudge from behind and reached up to stroke Whinney's sturdy neck, grateful that her friend had reminded her that she was not alone. When she lived in the valley, after she left the Clan, for a long time the horse had been her only companion. She hadn't noticed the slack in Whinney's rope as the horse moved closer to her, but she gave Racer a bit more lead. The mare and her offspring usually found friendship and comfort in each other, but when the mare came into season it had disturbed their usual pattern.</p>
<p>More people--how could there be so many?--were looking in her direction, and Jondalar was talking earnestly with the brown-haired man, then waved at her and smiled. When he started back down, he was followed by the young woman, the brown-haired man, and a few others. Ayla took a deep breath and waited.</p>
<p>As they approached, the wolf's growl became louder. Ayla reached down to hold him close to her. "It's all right, Wolf," she said. "It's just Jondalar's kin." Her calming touch was a signal to him to stop growling, not to appear too threatening. The signal had been difficult to teach him, but worth the effort, especially now, she thought. She wished she knew of a touch that would calm her.</p>
<p>The group with Jondalar stopped a short distance away, trying not to show their trepidation or to stare at the animals that openly stared at them and held their place even when strange people approached them. Jondalar stepped into the breach.</p>
<p>"I think we should start with formal introductions, Joharran," he said, looking at the brown-haired man.</p>
<p>As Ayla dropped both halter ropes in preparation for a formal introduction, which required contact with both hands, the horses stepped back, but the wolf stayed. She noticed the glint of fear in the man's eye, although she doubted that this man was afraid of much, and glanced at Jondalar, wondering if he had a reason for wanting formal introductions immediately. She looked closely at the unfamiliar man and was suddenly reminded of Brun, the leader of the clan that she grew up with. Powerful, proud, intelligent, competent, there was little he had feared--except the world of the spirits.</p>
<p>"Ayla, this is Joharran, Leader of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, son of Marthona, former Leader of the Ninth Cave, born to the hearth of Joconan, former Leader of the Ninth Cave," the tall blond man said with seriousness. Then he grinned. "Not to mention brother of Jondalar, Traveler to Distant Lands."</p>
<p>There were a few quick smiles. His comment relieved the tension somewhat. Strictly, in a formal introduction, a person could give the entire list of their names and ties to validate their status--all their own designations, titles and accomplishments, and all their kin and their relationships, along with their titles and accomplishments--and some did. But as a matter of practice, except in the most ceremonial of circumstances, just the primary ones were mentioned. It was not uncommon, however, for young people, especially brothers, to make jocular additions to the long and sometimes tedious recitation of one's kinships, and Jondalar was reminding his brother of past years, before he was burdened with the responsibilities of leadership.</p>
<p>"Joharran, this is Ayla of the Mamutoi, Member of the Lion Camp, Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth, Chosen by the Spirit of the Cave Lion, and Protected by the Cave Bear."</p>
<p>The brown-haired man crossed the distance between himself and the young woman and held out both hands, palms up, in the understood gesture of welcome and openhanded friendship. He did not recognize any of her ties, and he wasn't entirely sure which were most important.</p>
<p>"In the name of Doni, the Great Earth Mother, I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi, Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth," he said.</p>
<p>Ayla took both his hands. "In the name of Mut, Great Mother of All, I greet you, Joharran, Leader of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii," she said, then smiled. "And brother of the traveler Jondalar."</p>
<p>Joharran noticed first that she spoke his language well, but with an unusual accent, and then he became conscious of her strange clothing and her foreign look, but when she smiled, he smiled back. Partly because she had showed her understanding of Jondalar's remark and let Joharran know that his brother was important to her, but mostly because he could not resist her smile.</p>
<p>Ayla was an attractive woman by anyone's standards: she was tall, had a firm, well-shaped body, long, dark blond hair that tended to wave, clear blue-gray eyes, and fine features, though of a slightly different character than those of Zelandonii women. But when she smiled, it was as if the sun had cast a special beam on her that lit each feature from within. She seemed to glow with such stunning beauty, Joharran caught his breath. Jondalar had always said her smile was remarkable, and he grinned seeing that his brother was not immune to it.</p>
<p>Then Joharran noticed the stallion prance nervously toward Jondalar, and he eyed the wolf. "Jondalar tells me we need to make some . . . ah . . . accommodation for these animals . . . somewhere nearby, I presume." Not too near, he thought.</p>
<p>"The horses just need a field with grass, near water, but we need to tell people that they shouldn't try to get close to them in the beginning unless Jondalar or I am with them. Whinney and Racer are nervous around people until they get used to them," Ayla said.</p>
<p>"I don't think that will be a problem," Joharran said, catching the movement of Whinney's tail and eyeing her. "They can stay here, if this small valley is appropriate."</p>
<p>"This will be fine," Jondalar said. "Though we may move them upstream, out of the way a little."</p>
<p>"Wolf is accustomed to sleeping near me," Ayla continued. She noticed Joharran's frown. "He's become quite protective and might cause a commotion if he can't be close by."</p>
<p>She could see his resemblance to Jondalar particularly in his forehead knotted with worry, and wanted to smile. But Joharran was seriously concerned. This was not a time for smiles, even if his expression gave her a feeling of warm familiarity.</p>
<p>Jondalar, too, had seen his brother's worried frown. "I think this would be a good time to introduce Joharran to Wolf," he said.</p>
<p>Joharran's eyes flew open in near panic, but before he could object, she reached for his hand as she bent down beside the meat eater. She put her arm around the large wolf's neck to settle an incipient growl--even she could smell the man's fear, so she was sure Wolf could.</p>
<p>"Let him smell your hand, first," she said. "That's Wolf's formal introduction." The wolf had learned from previous experience that it was important to Ayla for him to accept within his pack of humans the people she introduced to him in this way. He didn't like the smell of fear, but sniffed the man to become familiar with him.</p>
<p>"Have you ever really felt the fur of a living wolf, Joharran?" she asked, looking up at him. "If you notice, it's a little coarse," she said, leading his hand to feel the animal's rather shaggy neck fur. "He's still shedding and itchy, and he loves to be scratched behind the ears," she continued, showing him how.</p>
<p>Joharran felt the fur, but was more aware of the warmth, and suddenly realized this was a living wolf! And it didn't seem to mind being touched.</p>
<p>Ayla observed that his hand was not as stiff, and that he actually attempted to rub the place she indicated. "Let him smell your hand again."</p>
<p>When Joharran brought his hand around toward the wolf's nose, he widened his eyes again, with surprise. "That wolf licked me!" he said, not sure if it was in preparation for something better--or worse. Then he saw Wolf lick Ayla's face, and she seemed very pleased about it.</p>
<p>"Yes, you were good, Wolf," she said, smiling, as she fondled him and roughed up his mane. Then she stood up and patted the front of her shoulders. The wolf jumped up, put his paws on the place she had indicated, and as she exposed her throat, he licked her neck, then took her chin and jaw in his mouth with a rumbling growl, but with great gentleness.</p>
<p>Jondalar noticed the gasps of astonishment from Joharran and the others and realized how frightening the familiar act of wolfish affection must seem to people who didn't understand. His brother looked at him, his expression both fearful and amazed. "What's he doing to her?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure that's all right?" Folara asked at nearly the same time. She could no longer keep still. The other people were making indecisive nervous movements as well.</p>
<p>Jondalar smiled. "Yes, Ayla is fine. He loves her; he would never hurt her. That's how wolves show affection. It took me a while to get used to it, too, and I've known Wolf as long as she has, ever since he was a fuzzy little cub."</p>
<p>"That's no cub! That's a big wolf! That's the biggest wolf I've ever seen!" Joharran said. "He could tear her throat out!"</p>
<p>"Yes. He could tear her throat out. I've seen him tear a woman's throat out . . . a woman who was trying to kill Ayla," Jondalar said. "Wolf protects her."</p>
<p>The Zelandonii who were watching breathed a collective sigh of relief when the wolf got down and stood by Ayla's side again with his mouth open and his tongue hanging out the side, showing his teeth. Wolf had that look that Jondalar thought of as his wolf grin, as though he was pleased with himself.</p>
<p>"Does he do that all the time?" Folara asked. "To . . . anyone?"</p>
<p>"No," Jondalar said. "Only to Ayla, and sometimes me, if he's feeling particularly happy, and only if we allow it. He's well-behaved, he won't harm anyone . . . unless Ayla is threatened."</p>
<p>"What about children?" Folara asked. "Wolves often go after the weak and the young." At the mention of children, looks of concern appeared on the faces of the people standing nearby.</p>
<p>"Wolf loves children," Ayla quickly explained, "and he is very protective toward them, particularly very young or weak ones. He was raised with the children of the Lion Camp."</p>
<p>"There was a very weak and sickly boy, who belonged to the Lion Hearth," Jondalar contributed. "You should have seen them play together. Wolf was always careful around him."</p>
<p>"That's a very unusual animal," another man said. "It's hard to believe a wolf could behave so . . . unwolflike."</p>
<p>"You're right, Solaban," Jondalar said. "He does behave in ways that seem very unwolflike to people, but if we were wolves we wouldn't think so. He was raised with people and Ayla says he thinks of people as his pack. He treats people as though they were wolves."</p>
<p>"Does he hunt?" the man called Solaban wanted to know.</p>
<p>"Yes," Ayla said. "Sometimes he hunts alone, for himself, and sometimes he helps us hunt."</p>
<p>"How does he know what he should hunt and what he shouldn't?" Folara asked. "Like those horses."</p>
<p>Ayla smiled. "The horses are part of his pack, too. You notice they are not afraid of him. And he never hunts people. Otherwise, he can hunt any animal he wants, unless I tell him not to."</p>
<p>"And if you say no, he doesn't?" another man asked.</p>
<p>"That's right, Rushemar," Jondalar affirmed.</p>
<p>The man shook his head in wonder. It was hard to believe anyone could have such control over a powerful hunting animal.</p>
<p>"Well, Joharran," Jondalar said. "Do you think it's safe enough to bring Ayla and Wolf up?"</p>
<p>The man thought for a moment, then nodded. "However, if there is any trouble . . ."</p>
<p>"There won't be, Joharran." Jondalar turned to Ayla. "My mother has invited us to stay with her. Folara still lives with her, but she has her own room, and so do Marthona and Willamar. He's gone on a trading mission now. She has offered her central living space to us. Of course, we could stay with Zelandoni at the visitors hearth, if you'd rather."</p>
<p>"I would be pleased to stay with your mother, Jondalar," Ayla said.</p>
<p>"Good! Mother also suggested that we wait with most formal introductions until we get settled in. It isn't as though I need to be introduced, and there's no point in repeating everything to each one when we can do it all at once."</p>
<p>"We're already planning a welcoming feast for tonight," Folara said. "And probably another one later, for all the nearby Caves."</p>
<p>"I appreciate your mother's thoughtfulness, Jondalar. It would be easier to meet everyone at once, but you might introduce me to this young woman," Ayla said.</p>
<p>Folara smiled.</p>
<p>"Of course, I was planning to," Jondalar said. "Ayla, this is my sister Folara, Blessed of Doni, of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii; Daughter of Marthona, former Leader of the Ninth Cave; born to the hearth of Willamar, Traveler and Trade Master; sister of Joharran, Leader of the Ninth Cave; sister of Jondalar . . ."</p>
<p>"She knows about you, Jondalar, and I've already heard her names and ties," Folara said, impatient with the formalities, then held out both hands toward Ayla. "In the name of Doni, the Great Earth Mother, I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi, Friend of Horses and Wolves."</p>
<p>The crowd of people standing on the sunny stone ledge quickly moved back when they saw the woman and the wolf start up the path along with Jondalar and the small group accompanying them. One or two took a step closer while a few others craned their necks around them. When they reached the stone ledge Ayla got her first view of the living space of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii. The sight surprised her.</p>
<p>Though she knew the word "Cave" in the name of Jondalar's home did not refer to a place, but to the group of people who lived there, and the formation she saw was not a cave, not as she had thought of one. A cave was a dark chamber or series of them within a rock face or cliff, or underground, with an opening to the outside. The living space of these people was the area beneath a huge overhanging shelf jutting out of the limestone cliff, an abri, that provided protection from rain or snow, but was open to daylight.</p>
<p>The high cliffs of the region had once been the floor beneath the surface of an ancient sea. As the calcareous shells of crustaceans that lived in the sea were discarded, they built up on the floor, and eventually became calcium carbonate--limestone. During certain periods of time, for a variety of reasons, some of the deposited shells created thick layers of limestone that were harder than others. When the earth shifted, exposing the sea floor until it eventually became cliffs, the weathering processes of wind and water cut into the relatively softer stone more easily, gouging out deep spaces and leaving ledges of the harder stone between.</p>
<p>Although the cliffs were also riddled with caves, which were common in limestone, these unusual shelflike formations created shelters of stone that made exceptionally good living sites and had been used as such for a great many thousands of years.</p>
<p>Jondalar led Ayla toward the older woman she had seen from the foot of the path. The woman was tall and dignified in her bearing as she waited patiently for them. Her hair, more gray than light brown, was pulled back from her face into one long braid, which was coiled at the back of her head. Her clear, direct, appraising eyes were also gray.</p>
<p>When they reached her, Jondalar began the formal introduction. "Ayla, this is Marthona, former Leader of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii; daughter of Jemara; born to the hearth of Rabanar; mated to Willamar, Trade Master of the Ninth Cave; Mother of Joharran, Leader of the Ninth Cave; Mother of Folara, Blessed of Doni; Mother of . . ." He started to say Thonolan, hesitated, then quickly filled in, "Jondalar, Returned Traveler." Then he turned to his mother.</p>
<p>"Marthona, this is Ayla of the Lion Camp of the Mamutoi, Daughter of the Mammoth Hearth, Chosen by the Spirit of the Cave Lion, Protected by the Spirit of the Cave Bear."</p>
<p>Marthona held out her two hands. "In the name of Doni, the Great Earth Mother, I welcome you, Ayla of the Mamutoi."</p>
<p>"In the name of Mut, Great Mother of All, I greet you, Marthona of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, and mother of Jondalar," Ayla said as they joined hands.</p>
<p>Marthona heard Ayla's words, wondered at her strange speech mannerism, noted how well she spoke in spite of it, and thought it was either a minor speech defect or the accent of a completely unfamiliar language from a very distant place. She smiled. "You have come a long way, Ayla, left all you knew and loved behind. If you had not, I don't think I would have Jondalar back home. I am grateful to you for that. I hope you will soon feel at home here, and I will do all I can to help you."</p>
<p>Ayla knew Jondalar's mother was sincere. Her directness and honesty were genuine; she was glad to have her son back. Ayla was relieved and touched by Marthona's welcome. "I have looked forward to meeting you since Jondalar first spoke of you . . . but I have been a little afraid, too," she replied with a similar directness and honesty.</p>
<p>"I don't blame you. I would have found it very difficult in your place. Come, let me show you where you can put your things. You must be tired and would like to rest before the welcoming celebration tonight," Marthona said, starting to lead them toward the area under the overhang. Suddenly Wolf started whining, yelped a little "puppy bark," and stretched his front paws out with his back end and tail up in a playful posture.</p>
<p>Jondalar was startled. "What is he doing?"</p>
<p>Ayla looked at Wolf, rather surprised as well. The animal repeated his gestures, and suddenly she smiled. "I think he's trying to get Marthona's attention," Ayla said. "He thinks she didn't notice him, and I think he wants to be introduced."</p>
<p>"And I want to meet him, too," Marthona said.</p>
<p>"You don't fear him!" Ayla said. "And he knows it!"</p>
<p>"I watched. I didn't see anything to fear," she said, extending her hand toward the wolf. He sniffed her hand, licked it, and whined again.</p>
<p>"I think Wolf wants you to touch him; he does love attention from people he likes," Ayla said.</p>
<p>"You do like that, don't you?" the older woman said as she stroked him. "Wolf? Is that what you called him?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It's just the Mamutoi word for 'wolf.' It seemed like the right name for him," Ayla explained.</p>
<p>"But, I've never seen him take to anyone so fast," Jondalar said, looking at his mother with awe.</p>
<p>"Nor have I," Ayla said, watching Marthona with the wolf. "Maybe he's just happy to meet someone who's not afraid of him."</p>
<p>As they walked into the shade of the overhanging stone, Ayla felt an immediate cooling of temperature. For a heartbeat, she shivered with a chill of fear and glanced up at the huge shelf of stone jutting out of the cliff wall, wondering if it could collapse. But when her eyes grew accustomed to the dimmer light, she was astonished by more than the physical formation of Jondalar's home. The space under the rock shelter was huge, much larger than she had imagined.</p>
<p>She had seen similar overhangs in the cliffs along this river on their way here, some obviously inhabited, though none seemed quite as sizable as this one. Everyone in the entire region knew of the immense rock shelter and the great number of people it housed. The Ninth Cave was the largest of all the communities that called themselves Zelandonii.</p>
<p>Clustered together at the eastern end of the protected space, along the back wall and freestanding in the middle, were individual structures, many quite large, made partly of stone and partly of wooden frames covered with hides. The hides were decorated with beautifully rendered pictures of animals and various abstract symbols painted in black and many vivid shades of red, yellow, and brown. The structures were arranged in a west-facing curve around an open space near the center of the area covered by the overhanging stone shelf, which was filled with a confusion of objects and people.</p>
<p>As Ayla looked more closely, what at first had struck her as a melange of rich clutter was resolving itself into areas dedicated to different tasks, often near to related tasks. It only seemed confusing initially only because so many activities were going on.</p>
<p>She saw hides being cured in frames, and long shafts of spears, apparently in the process of being straightened, leaning against a crosspiece supported by two posts. Baskets in different stages of completion were stacked in another place, and thongs were drying stretched between pairs of bone posts. Long skeins of cordage hung from pegs pounded into crossbeams above unfinished nets stretched across a frame, and loosely woven netting in bundles on the ground. Skins, some dyed various colors, including many shades of red, were cut into pieces and nearby, partially assembled articles of clothing were hanging.</p>
<p>She recognized most of the crafts, but near the clothing was an activity that was entirely unfamiliar. A frame held many strands of thin cord vertically, with a design partially formed from the material woven horizontally across them. She wanted to go over and look closer, and promised herself she would, later. Pieces of wood, stone, bone, antler, and mammoth ivory were in other places, carved into implements--ladles, spoons, bowls, tongs, weapons--most of them with carved and sometimes painted decorations. There were also small sculptures and carvings that were not utensils or tools. They seemed to be made for themselves or some purpose of which she wasn't aware.</p>
<p>She saw vegetables and herbs hanging high from large frames with many cross pieces, and lower to the ground, meat drying on racks. Somewhat away from other activities was an area scattered with sharp stone chips; for people like Jondalar, she thought, flintknappers who made tools, knives, and spear points.</p>
<p>And everywhere she looked, she saw people. The community that lived under the spacious rock shelter was of a size to match the space. Ayla had grown up in a clan of less than thirty people; at the Clan Gathering, which occurred once every seven years, two hundred people came together for a short period, a huge assembly to her then. Though the Mamutoi Summer Meeting drew a much greater number, the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii alone comprised of over two hundred individuals living together at this one place, was larger than the entire Clan Gathering!</p>
<p>Ayla didn't know how many people were standing around watching them, but she was reminded of the time she had walked with Brun's clan into that congregation of clans and felt all of them looking at her. They had tried to be unobtrusive, but the people who were staring as Marthona led Jondalar, Ayla, and a wolf to her living place weren't so polite about it. They didn't try to look down or glance away. She wondered if she would ever get used to living with so many people close by all the time; she wondered if she wanted to.</p>
