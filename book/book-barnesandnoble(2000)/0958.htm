He is in love with a very special woman and even a series of ghastly murders he's investigating can't diminish his happiness. Cross's pursuit of the killer quickly produces a suspect- a British diplomat named Geoffrey Shaffer. However, proving that Shaffer is the murderer is a difficult challenge. The diplomat engages in a brilliant series of surprising counter moves, in court and out, and Cross and his fiancee become the targets of a deadly cabal of killers masterminded by Shaffer.<br><br><i>Pop!Goes the Weasel</i> is James Patterson at the peak of his power. It's his most dynamic and powerful psychological thriller to date. Here is a villain no reader will forget, a love story of great tenderness, and a plot of relentless suspense and heart pounding pace. Booksellers and readers will soon discover why James Patterson is at the very top of his field and one of the finest suspense writers of his time.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Patterson dedicates his latest (after 1998's <i>When the Wind Blows</i>) to "the millions of Alex Cross readers who so frequently ask 'Can't you write faster?'" Those readers won't be disappointed: the successful formula is in high gear, with the Washington, D.C., psychologist/homicide detective up to his ears in unsolved murders. This tale features a duplicitous villain, a glut of dirty office politics and the inevitable threat to someone Cross just can't live without. A highly moral character, Cross is now firmly rooted in many imaginations as Morgan Freeman, who played him in the film version of <i>Kiss the Girls</i>. When he's not caring for Damon and Jannie, his two young children, Cross takes boys to visit their fathers in prison and works in a soup kitchen. After his boss, Chief Pittman, refuses to believe that a serial killer is striking in the neglected Southeast section, Cross and four other officers work extra hours on their own, the only ones who really care. Readers learn early on that the killer is a British diplomat, Geoffrey Shafer, a chilling madman ostensibly holding his sanity together with drugs. Shafer is obsessed with a real-life version of a computer game called the Four Horsemen, during which he masquerades as a taxi driver who kills his unsuspecting passengers. If Shafer is almost too good to be true--another fictional psychopath with infinite resources--Patterson is shrewd enough to show him making mistakes (like forgetting to wash) as he comes apart at the seams. The killer is caught in the middle of the narrative, setting the scene for a bold courtroom drama. Even the disappearance of Cross's new lady love (his wife was killed in a previous book) is less of a clich d device than a ritual sacrifice as Patterson's well-oiled suspense machine grinds away with solid precision.

											I've read most of the Alex Cross Series by James Patterson.  Although Jack and Jill was my favorite, this novel was excellent.  As usual, there is excellent depth of character (Alex and Nana, for example) which can actually make you care for the characters.  The plot is original, somewhat off beat, thrilling and carefully thought out with a few twists here and there.  I also love his writing style.  His writing style and short chapters make his novels an easy read.  Patterson has never disappointed me with this Women's Murder Club Series either.  I highly recommend 1st to Die.  The Quickie and Swimsuit were also excellent novels.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Pop Goes the Weasel<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1282005_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780446608817_BK_1_1282005" href="#previewReview_1282005" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>January 11, 2010:

Inspired by bestselling hair-raising thrillers like <I>The Day of the Jackal</I> and <I>The Exorcist</I>, Patterson went to work on his first novel. Published in 1976, <I>The Thomas Berryman Number</I> established him as a writer of tightly constructed mysteries that move forward with the velocity of a bullet. For his startling debut, Patterson was awarded the prestigious Edgar Award for Best First Mystery Novel -- an auspicious beginning to one of the most successful careers in publishing.<p>    A string of gripping standalone mysteries followed, but it was the 1992 release of <I>Along Came a Spider</I> that elevated Patterson to superstar status. Introducing Alex Cross, a brilliant black police detective/forensic psychologist, the novel was the first installment in a series of bestselling thrillers that has proved to be a cash cow for the author and his publisher. <p>    Examining Patterson's track record, it's obvious that he believes one good series deserves another...maybe even a third!  In 2001, he debuted the Women's Murder Club with <i>1st to Die</I>, a fast-paced thriller featuring four female crime fighters living in San Francisco -- a homicide detective, a medical examiner, an assistant D.A., and a cub reporter. The successful series has continued with other numerically titled installments. Then, spinning off a set of characters from a previous novel (1998's <i>When the Wind Blows</I>), in 2005 he  published <i>Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment</I>. Featuring a "flock" of genetically engineered flying children, the novel was a huge hit, especially with teen readers, and spawned a series of vastly popular fantasy adventures.<p>    In addition to continuing his bestselling literary franchises, Patterson has also found time to co-author thrillers with other writers -- including Peter de Jonge, Andrew Gross, Maxine Paetro, and Howard Roughan -- and has even ventured into romance (<i>Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas</I>, <i>Sam's Letters to Jennifer</I>) and children's literature (<i>santaKid</I>). Writing at an astonishing pace, this prolific author has turned himself into a one-man publishing juggernaut, fulfilling his clearly stated ambition to become "the king of the page-turners."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Patterson's <I>Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas</I></b> was inspired by a diary his wife kept that tracked the development of their toddler son.<p>    <b>Two of Patterson's Alex Cross mysteries</b> (<i>Along Came a Spider</I> and <i>Kiss the Girls</I>) have been turned into films starring  Morgan Freeman; in 2007, a weekly television series premiered, based on the bestselling Women's Murder Club novels.<p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>James Patterson took a few moments to talk with us about his favorite books.</i><p>  <b>What was the book that most influenced your life?</b><br>  <i>A Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is probably the novel that most influenced me as a young writer -- simply because as I read it, I realized that I could never do anything half as good.  So why not try mysteries?  Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez's magical mystery tour begins with one of the most engaging lines in fiction:  "Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend�a was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice." What follows is an exhilarating recounting of a century in the imaginary Colombian town of Macondo -- the comedies and tragedies, joy and suffering, sublime and ridiculous.  An entire town, for example, is affected with insomnia at one point in the novel.  A woman literally rises to heaven while drying her laundry.  And eventually, the firing squad, fires.  Some have called this the great American novel � only it was written by a South American.  <p>  <b>What are your 10 favorite books?</b><br>  <ul>  <li><i>A Hundred Years of Solitude</i> by Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez  <li><i>Madame Bovary</i> by Gustave Flaubert  <li><i>Ulysses</i> by James Joyce  <li><i>Our Lady of the Flowers</i> by Jean Genet  <li><i>Catcher in the Rye</i> by J.

While resembling the gritty psychological works of John Sandford and Thomas Harris, Patterson has firmly wedged his own easy-flowing, spine-tingling niche in the genre, and has mined an area of suspense that is clearly all his own.<p>A serial killer called the Weasel is slaughtering women in the slums of D.C. And family man Geoffrey Shafer is much more than he appears. Not only is Shafer a diplomat with the British Embassy &#151; and so has diplomatic immunity &#151; but he also takes himself to the edge of sanity with hallucinogenic drugs, disguises himself as a black cab driver, and rolls the dice to decide the life-or-death fates of his black female fares. Soon Alex Cross and his partner, John Sampson, are hunting the elusive killer, but before they are even able to properly begin their investigation, their racist police chief forces them to look into the by-the-numbers murder of a rich white man instead.<p>When the Weasel, who is also a former MI-6 agent, begins sending email messages to three of his former cohorts concerning a demented online role-playing game, the situation grows even more deranged. To make matters worse, Sampson's ex-wife is found murdered in a ghetto, and the angry detectives willingly disregard their ordersandagain return to tracking the Weasel. When Cross's fianc&eacute;e, Christine, is kidnapped while vacationing in Bermuda, and Cross is emailed to quit the hunt, his resolve to continue the pursuit is reinforced. But when Shafer is caught, the <i>real</i> battle of wits begins as a high-profile trial puts Cross's reputation, his life, and perhaps his very sanity, on the line.<p>The subplots in <I>Pop Goes the Weasel</I> are what capably tightens the novel to the breaking point as the story quickly progresses through a series of brutal crimes, which continue to move closer and closer to home. Not only do we witness Cross's search for one maniacal killer, but three other homicidal maniacs are at work over the Internet. The mix of British charm and a cold indifference to murder brews an aperitif of bloodthirsty characterization not found in fiction for a long while. As a master of lies, Shafer can dupe a jury and also take advantage of the grief-stricken to help sway events in his favor, casting doubts not only into the minds of the police, but also into those of the readers who already know the truth of the situation.<p>Patterson's attention to the seamy side of Washington, D.C., is also a powerful draw, since its perverse yet politically potent aspects add credible facets to both our protagonist and our psychotic villain. The author knows how to stretch out his suspense factor &#151; his use of incredibly short chapters and increasingly taut plot elements is superior. The story flies by with such speed that you'll suffer from friction burns from turning the pages so quickly. Once again, James Patterson proves that he's more than capable of conceiving engaging, cunning stories that transcend the serial killer subgenre. <I>Pop Goes the Weasel</I> works as an intense character portrait that will leave readers moved and electrified.<p><i>&#151;Tom Piccirilli</i><p><i>Tom Piccirilli is the author of the critically acclaimed supernatural novel </i>Pentacle,<i> as well as the dark-suspense mysteries </i>Shards<i> and </i>The Dead Past.<i> His short fiction has appeared in many anthologies, including </i>The Conspiracy Files.<i> His two latest, an exciting mystery called </i>Sorrow's Crown<i> and a horror novel called</i> Hexes,<i> have just been released.</i><p> <p>
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Alex Cross is back, to face his most complex and formidable villain yet, a man known as The Weasel, who threatens to destroy all Alex holds dear.<br><br>Things are looking great for Alex Cross. He is in love with a very special woman and even a series of ghastly murders he's investigating can't diminish his happiness. Cross's pursuit of the killer quickly produces a suspect- a British diplomat named Geoffrey Shaffer. However, proving that Shaffer is the murderer is a difficult challenge. The diplomat engages in a brilliant series of surprising counter moves, in court and out, and Cross and his fiancee become the targets of a deadly cabal of killers masterminded by Shaffer.<br><br><i>Pop!Goes the Weasel</i> is James Patterson at the peak of his power. It's his most dynamic and powerful psychological thriller to date. Here is a villain no reader will forget, a love story of great tenderness, and a plot of relentless suspense and heart pounding pace. Booksellers and readers will soon discover why James Patterson is at the very top of his field and one of the finest suspense writers of his time.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Patterson dedicates his latest (after 1998's <i>When the Wind Blows</i>) to "the millions of Alex Cross readers who so frequently ask 'Can't you write faster?'" Those readers won't be disappointed: the successful formula is in high gear, with the Washington, D.C., psychologist/homicide detective up to his ears in unsolved murders. This tale features a duplicitous villain, a glut of dirty office politics and the inevitable threat to someone Cross just can't live without. A highly moral character, Cross is now firmly rooted in many imaginations as Morgan Freeman, who played him in the film version of <i>Kiss the Girls</i>. When he's not caring for Damon and Jannie, his two young children, Cross takes boys to visit their fathers in prison and works in a soup kitchen. After his boss, Chief Pittman, refuses to believe that a serial killer is striking in the neglected Southeast section, Cross and four other officers work extra hours on their own, the only ones who really care. Readers learn early on that the killer is a British diplomat, Geoffrey Shafer, a chilling madman ostensibly holding his sanity together with drugs. Shafer is obsessed with a real-life version of a computer game called the Four Horsemen, during which he masquerades as a taxi driver who kills his unsuspecting passengers. If Shafer is almost too good to be true--another fictional psychopath with infinite resources--Patterson is shrewd enough to show him making mistakes (like forgetting to wash) as he comes apart at the seams. The killer is caught in the middle of the narrative, setting the scene for a bold courtroom drama. Even the disappearance of Cross's new lady love (his wife was killed in a previous book) is less of a clich d device than a ritual sacrifice as Patterson's well-oiled suspense machine grinds away with solid precision.

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Alex Cross, last seen in <i>Cat & Mouse</i>, returns in Patterson's best book to date. With his fiancee, Christine, by his side, Alex has regained the happiness he lost. He can't stay happy for long, of course, and his nemesis this time is Geoffrey Shafer, the Weasel. Shafer is a British diplomat who lives a secret life; he murders people during a fantasy game he plays with three other men around the globe. Alex doesn't know it, but he and the people he cares about are the newest pawns in the game. Even with implausible situations and an absurdly evil villain, the book is impossible to put down. Patterson has another guaranteed best seller on his hands, and fans will be clamoring for the next Alex Cross adventure.--Jeff Ayers, Seattle P.L. Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>After a flight in fantasy with <i>When the Wind Blows</i>, Patterson goes to ground with another slash-and-squirm psychokiller page-turner, this one dedicated to "the millions of Alex Cross readers, who so frequently ask, can't you write faster?"   By day, Geoffrey Shafer is a charming, 42-year-old British Embassy paper-pusher with a picture-perfect family and a shady past as an MI-6 secret agent. Come sundown, he swallows a pharmacy of psychoactive pills, gulps three black coffees loaded with sugar, and roams the streets of Washington, D.C., in a battered cab, where, disguised as a black man, he rolls dice to determine which among his black female fares he'll murder. Afterwards he dumps his naked victims in crime-infested back alleys of black-slum neighborhoods, then sends e-mails boasting of his accomplishments to three other former MI-6 agents involved in a hellish Internet role-playing game. "I sensed I was at the start of another homicide mess," sighs forensic-psychologist turned homicide-detective Alex Cross. Cross yearns to catch the "Jane Doe murderer" but is thwarted by Det. Chief George Pittman, who assigns sexy Det. Patsy Hampton to investigate Cross and come up with a reason for dismissing him. Meanwhile, Cross's fiancee is kidnaped during a Bermuda vacation, and an anonymous e-mail warns him to back off. He doesn't, of course, and just when it appears that Patterson is sleep-walking through his story, Cross nabs Shafer minutes after Shafer kills Det. Hampton. During the subsequent high-visibility trail, Shafer manages to make the jury believe that he's innocent and that Cross was trying to frame him. When all seems lost, a sympathetic British intelligence chief offersto help Cross bring down Shafer, and the other homicidal game-players, during a showdown on the breezy beaches of Jamaica.  Kinky mayhem, a cartoonish villain, regular glimpses of the kindly Cross caring for his loved ones, and an ending that spells a sequel&#58; Patterson's fans couldn't ask for more. <P>

"Get out of the car right now."<p> Shafer suddenly felt calm and relaxed. There was no tension left in his body.<p> "All right. All right. I'm getting out. No problem." <p> "You know how fast you were going?" the cop asked in an agitated voice, his face flushed a bright red.

"Maybe a little over the speed limit."<p> Then he took out an I.D. card and handed it over. "But you can't do anything about it. I'm with the British Embassy.

The game was everything to him, the only part of his life with real meaning.<p> He sped across town from the British Embassy, all the way to the Petworth district of Northwest. He knew he shouldn't be there, a white man in a spiffy Jaguar. He couldn't help himself, though, any more than he could that morning. <p> He stopped the car just before he got to Petworth. Shafer took out his laptop and typed a message to the other players, the Horsemen.<p> Friends, Death Is On The Loose In Washington. The Game Is On<p> He started the Jag again and rode a few more blocks to Petworth. The usual outrageously provocative hookers were already parading up and down Varnum and Webster streets. A song called "Nice and Slow" was playing from a vibrating blue BMW. Ronnie McCall's sweet voice blended into the early evening. The girls waved to him and showed their large, flat, pert, or flabby breasts. Several wore colorful bustiers with matching hot pants and shiny silver or red platform shoes with pointy heels. He slowed to a stop beside a small black girl who looked to be around sixteen and had an unusually pretty face. Her legs were long and slender for such a petite body. She wore too much makeup for his taste. Still, she was hard to resist, so why should he?<p>
"Nice car. Jaguar. I like it a lot," she cooed, then smiled and made a sexy little "O" with her lipsticked mouth. "You're cute, too, mistah."<p>
He smiled back at her. "Jump in, then. Let's go for a test ride. See if it's true love or just infatuation." He glanced around the street quickly. None of the other girls were working this corner.<p>
"A hundred for full-service, sweetie?" she asked as she wiggled her tight little butt inside the Jag. Her perfume smelled like eau de bubble gum, and she seemed to have bathed in it.<p>
"As I said, get into the car. A hundred dollars is petty cash for me."<p>
He knew he shouldn't be picking her up in the Jaguar, but he took her for a joy ride anyway. He couldn't help himself now.<p>
He brought the girl to a small, wooded park in a part of Washington called Shaw. He parked in a thicket of fir trees that hid the car from sight. He looked at the prostitute, and she was even smaller and younger than he had thought.<p>
"How old are you?" he asked.<p>
"How old you want me to be?" she said, and smiled. "Sweetie, I need the money first. You know how it works."<p>
"Yes. But do you?" he asked.<p>
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a switchblade knife. He had it at her throat in an instant.<p>
"Don't hurt me," she whispered. "Just be cool."<p>
"Get out of the car. Slowly. Don't you dare scream. You be cool."<p>
Shafer got out with her, staying close, the knife still pressed to the hollow of her throat.<p>
"It's all just a game, darling," he explained. "My name is Death. You're a very lucky girl. I'm the best player of all." As if to prove it, he stabbed her for the first time.<p>
