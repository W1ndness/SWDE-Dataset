Awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1993, Morrison powerfully evokes in her fiction the legacies of displacement and slavery that have been bequeathed to the African-American community. Morrison was born in Ohio, educated at Howard University and Cornell University, and is now a member of the faculty of Princeton University. Her most widely read novel is perhaps <i>Beloved</i> (1987), which won the Pulitzer Prize and was recently adapted for film. <i>Song of Solomon</i> (1977), however, is perhaps the most lyrical of her novels, following Milkman Dead as he struggles to understand his family history and the ways in which that history has both been damaged by and transcended the horror of slavery. All of Morrison's fiction, from her first novel, <i>The Bluest Eye</i> (1970), to last year's <i>Paradise</i> (1998), explores both the need for and the impossibility of real community and the bonds that both unite and divide African-American women. Morrison has also published a volume of critical work entitled <i>Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination</i>.</p><h3>Ms. Magazine

											I was assigned Toni Morrison as an author for a novel study I was in and was skeptical at first, but Toni Morrison proved me wrong! This book was amazing! From the moment I picked up the book I couldn?t set it down. She draws you in and makes you never want to put her book down.   Dramatic, intense, romantic, captivating and exhilarating are just a few words that describe this novel. I loved how she described the characters and made you a part of their life so much so that you insert yourself in their situations and vice versa them into yours and question how they would react. In my mind when I see how people respond to certain situations I title them as a character from Song of Solomon 'for example he just pulled a milkman or she is so much like Hagar'.  This is most definitely not a children?s book or a bed time story. This book is written at a mature level that is still enjoyable for high schooler and up. As a high schooler my self I enjoyed many of the qualities of this book. Like many things I am sure it would be just as enjoyable as an adult if not more so.   I feel that this point of view chose of third person was both captivating and impressive. It allowed greater Character development to occur. Guitars development left me amazed at how little he trusted his friend. It was just so captivating.    Not only the characters but also the settings become real and vivid  she left me feeling as though I had walked on Not Doctor Street, and visited all of the places throughout the novel. I just can not sing enough praises for this novel. I am ready to read it over and over to draw more conclusions, and catch things from this novel that I missed the first time through. Toni Morrison?s novel impressed me so much that I can?t wait to get another one. The storyline is spectacular and the language is simply stunning, and I would have to call this novel breathtaking. I give Song of Solomon two thumbs up. I would recommend it to anyone.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35705780.JPG" alt="" height="141" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Toni Morrison</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>Chloe Anthony Wofford (real name)</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Princeton, New Jersey, and Manhattan</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>February 18, 1931</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Lorain, Ohio</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Howard University, B.A. in English, 1953; Cornell, M.A., 1955</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Nobel Prize in Literature, 1993; National Book Critics' Circle Award, 1977, for <I>Song of Solomon</I>; Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, 1988, for <I>Beloved</I></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Toni Morrison has been called "black America's best novelist," and her incredible string of imaginative contemporary classics would suggest that she is actually one of America's best novelists regardless of race. Be that as it may, it is indeed difficult to disconnect Morrison's work from racial issues, as they lie at the heart of her most enduring novels.<p>         Growing up in Lorain, Ohio, a milieu <I>Jet</I> magazine described as "mixed and sometimes hostile," Morrison experienced racism firsthand. (When she was still a toddler, her home was set on fire with her family inside.) Yet, her father instilled in her a great sense of dignity, a cultural pride that would permeate her writing. She distinguished herself in school, graduating from Howard and Cornell Universities with bachelor's and master's degrees in English; in addition to her career as a writer, she has taught at several colleges and universities, lectured widely, and worked in publishing.<p>         Morrison made her literary debut in 1970 with <I>The Bluest Eye,</I> the story of a lonely 11-year-old black girl who prays that God will turn her eyes blue, in the na�ve belief that this transformation will change her miserable life. As the tale unfolds, her life does change, but in ways almost too tragic and devastating to contemplate. On its publication, the book received mixed reviews; but  John Leonard of <i>The New York Times</I> recognized the brilliance of Morrison's writing, describing her prose as "...so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry."<p>         Over time, Morrison's talent became self-evident, and her reputation grew with each successive book. Her second novel, <i>Sula,</I> was nominated for a National Book Award; her third, 1977's <i>Song of Solomon,</I> established her as a true literary force. Shot through with the mythology and African-American folklore that informed Morrison's childhood in Ohio, this contemporary folktale is notable for its blending of supernatural and realistic elements. It was reviewed rapturously and went on win a National Book Critics Circle Award. <p>         The culmination of Morrison's storytelling skills, and the book most often considered her masterpiece, is <i>Beloved</I>. Published in 1987 and inspired by an incident from history, this post-Civil War ghost story tells the story of Sethe, a former runaway slave who murdered her baby daughter rather than condemn her to a life of slavery. Now, 18 years later, Sethe and her family are haunted by the spirit of the dead child. Heartbreaking and harrowing, <i>Beloved</I> grapples with mythic themes of love and loss, family and freedom, grief and guilt, while excavating the tragic, shameful legacy of slavery. The novel so moved Morrison's literary peers that 48 of them signed an open letter published in <I>The New York Times,</I> demanding that she be recognized for this towering achievement. The book went on to win the Pulitzer Prize; and in 2006, it was selected by <i>The New York Times</I> as the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years.<p>         In addition to her extraordinary novels, Morrison has also written a play, short stories, a children's book, and copious nonfiction, including essays, reviews, and literary and social criticism. While she has made her name by addressing important African-American themes, her narrative power and epic sweep have won her a wide and diverse audience. She cannot be dismissed as a "black writer" any more than we can shoehorn Faulkner's fiction into "southern literature."  Fittingly, she received the Nobel Prize in 1993; perhaps the true power of her impressive body of work is best summed up in the Swedish Academy's citation, which reads: "To Toni Morrison, who, in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Chloe Anthony Wofford chose to publish her first novel</b> under the name Toni Morrison because she believed that Toni was easier to pronounce than Chloe.

</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Toni Morrison's <b>Song of Solomon,</b> a novel of large beauty and power, creates a magical world out of four generations of black life in America, a world we enter on the day of the birth of Macon Dead, Jr. (known as Milkman), son of the richest black family in a mid-western town; the day on which the lonely insurance man, Robert Smith, poised in blue silk wings, attempts to fly from a steeple of the hospital, a black Icarus looking homeward...<br><br>We see Milkman growing up in his father's money-haunted, death-haunted house with his silent sisters and strangely passive mother, beginning to move outward&#151;through his profound love and combat with his friend Guitar...through Guitar's mad and loving commitment to the secret avengers called the Seven Days...through Milkman's exotic, imprisoning affair with his love-blind cousin, Hagar...and through his unconscious apprenticeship to his mystical Aunt Pilate, who saved his life before he was born.<br><br>And we follow him as he strikes out alone; moving first toward adventure and then&#151;as the unspoken truth about his family and his own buried heritage announces itself&#151;toward an adventurous and crucial embrace of life.<br><br>This is a novel that expresses, with passion, tenderness, and a magnificence of language, the mysterious primal essence of family bond and conflict, the feelings and experience of all people wanting, and striving, to be alive.</p><h3>Ms. Magazine

</p><h3>Sacred Fire</h3><p><i>Song of Solomon</i>, Toni Morrison's lyrical third novel, begins with an arresting scene -- a man on a roof threatening to jump, a woman standing on the ground, singing, and another woman entering labor. The child born of that labor is Macon "Milkman" Dead III; <i>Song of Solomon</i> is the epic story of his life-time journey toward an understanding of his own identity and ancestry. Milkman is born burdened with the materialistic values of his father and the weight of a racist society; over the course of his odyssey he reconnects to his deeper family values and history, rids himself of the burden of his father's expectations and society's limitations, and literally learns to fly.<p>
When the novel opens, Milkman is clearly a man with little or no concern for others. Like his father, he is driven only by his immediate sensual needs; he is spoiled and self-centered and pursues money and sexual gratification at all costs. The novel centers around his search for a lost bag of gold that was allegedly taken from a man involved in his grandfather's murder and then abandoned by his Aunt Pilate. The search for gold takes Milkman and his friend Guitar, a young black militant, to Shalimar, a town named for his great-grandfather Solomon, who according to local legend escaped slavery by taking flight back to Africa on the wind. On his journey, under the influence of his Aunt Pilate, a strong, fearless, natural woman whose values are the opposite of Milkman's father's, Milkman begins to come to terms with his family history, his role as a man, and the possibilities of his life apart from a cycle of physical lust and satisfaction.<p>
In telling the story of Milkman's quest to discover the hidden history of the Deads, Morrison expertly weaves together elements of myth, magic, and folklore. She grapples with fundamental issues of class and race, ancestry and identity, while never losing sight of Milkman's compelling story. The language in <i>Song of Solomon</i>, Morrison's only novel with a male protagonist, is earthy and poetic, the characters eccentric, and the detail vivid and convincing. The result is a novel that is at once emotionally intense, provocative, and inspiring in its description of how one man rediscovered the latent power within him.<p>
<i>Song of Solomon</i> is considered to be Toni Morrison's masterpiece and is in the top echelon of literary works produced by any American writer. It is also her breakthrough novel in both critical and commercial success: It was the first African American novel since <i>Native Son</i> to be a main selection of the Book of the Month club and it won the prestigious National Book Critics Circle Award among others. The book received a second life, and best-seller status, twenty years after its initial publication when talk show host Oprah Winfrey announced it as a selection for her on-air book club.
</p><h3>Reynolds Price</h3><p>&quot;Toni Morrison&#9;s fisrt two books - <i>The Bluest Eye</i> with the purity of its terrors and <i>Sula</i> with its dense poetry and the depth of its probing into a small circle of lives - were strong novels.  Yet, firm as they both were in achievement and promise, they didn't fully forecast her new book, <i>Song Of Solomon.</i>...
     ...Toni Morrison has earned attention and praise.  Few Americans know, and can say, more than she has in this wise and spacious novel.&quot;-

</div><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P><b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><br><br>The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance agent promised to fly from Mercy to the other side of Lake Superior at three o'clock. Two days before the event was to take place he tacked a note on the door of his little yellow house&#58;<br><br><br>At 3&#58;00 p.m. on Wednesday the 18th of February, 1931, I will take off from Mercy and fly away on my own wings. Please forgive me. I loved you all.<br>(signed) Robert Smith,<br>Ins. agent<br><br><br>Mr. Smith didn't draw as big a crowd as Lindbergh had four years earlier&#151;not more than forty or fifty people showed up&#151;because it was already eleven o'clock in the morning, on the very Wednesday he had chosen for his flight, before anybody read the note. At that time of day, during the middle of the week, word-of-mouth news just lumbered along. Children were in school; men were at work; and most of the women were fastening their corsets and getting ready to go see what tails or entrails the butcher might be giving away. Only the unemployed, the self-employed, and the very young were available&#151;deliberately available because they'd heard about it, or accidentally available because they happened to be walking at that exact moment in the shore end of Not Doctor Street, a name the post office did not recognize. Town maps registered the street as Mains Avenue, but the only colored doctor in the city had lived and died on that street, and when he moved there in 1896 his patients took to calling the street, which none of them lived in or near, Doctor Street. Later, when other Negroes moved there, and when the postal service became a popular means of transferring messages among them, envelopes from Louisiana, Virginia, Alabama, and Georgia began to arrive addressed to people at house numbers on Doctor Street. The post office workers returned these envelopes or passed them on to the Dead Letter Office. Then in 1918, when colored men were being drafted, a few gave their address at the recruitment office as Doctor Street. In that way, the name acquired a quasi-official status. But not for long. Some of the city legislators, whose concern for appropriate names and the maintenance of the city's landmarks was the principal part of their political life, saw to it that &quot;Doctor Street&quot; was never used in any official capacity. And since they knew that only Southside residents kept it up, they had notices posted in the stores, barbershops, and restaurants in that part of the city saying that the avenue running northerly and southerly from Shore Road fronting the lake to the junction of routes 6 and 2 leading to Pennsylvania, and also running parallel to and between Rutherford Avenue and Broadway, had always been and would always be known as Mains Avenue and not Doctor Street.<br><br>It was a genuinely clarifying public notice because it gave Southside residents a way to keep their memories alive and please the city legislators as well. They called it Not Doctor Street, and were inclined to call the charity hospital at its northern end No Mercy Hospital since it was 1931, on the day following Mr. Smith's leap from its cupola, before the first colored expectant mother was allowed to give birth inside its wards and not on its steps. The reason for the hospital's generosity to that particular woman was not the fact that she was the only child of this Negro doctor, for during his entire professional life he had never been granted hospital privileges and only two of his patients were ever admitted to Mercy, both white. Besides, the doctor had been dead a long time by 1931. It must have been Mr. Smith's leap from the roof over their heads that made them admit her. In any case, whether or not the little insurance agent's conviction that he could fly contributed to the place of her delivery, it certainly contributed to its time.<br><br>When the dead doctor's daughter saw Mr. Smith emerge as promptly as he had promised from behind the cupola, his wide blue silk wings curved forward around his chest, she dropped her covered peck basket, spilling red velvet rose petals. The wind blew them about, up, down, and into small mounds of snow. Her half-grown daughters scrambled about trying to catch them, while their mother moaned and held the underside of her stomach. The rose-petal scramble got a lot of attention, but the pregnant lady's moans did not. Everyone knew the girls had spent hour after hour tracing, cutting, and stitching the costly velvet, and that Gerhardt's Department Store would be quick to reject any that were soiled.<br><br>It was nice and gay there for a while. The men joined in trying to collect the scraps before the snow soaked through them&#151;snatching them from a gust of wind or plucking them delicately from the snow. And the very young children couldn't make up their minds whether to watch the man circled in blue on the roof or the bits of red flashing around on the ground. Their dilemma was solved when a woman suddenly burst into song. The singer, standing at the back of the crowd, was as poorly dressed as the doctor's daughter was well dressed. The latter had on a neat gray coat with the traditional pregnant-woman bow at her navel, a black cloche, and a pair of four-button ladies' galoshes. The singing woman wore a knitted navy cap pulled far down over her forehead. She had wrapped herself up in an old quilt instead of a winter coat. Her head cocked to one side, her eyes fixed on Mr. Robert Smith, she sang in a powerful contralto&#58;<br><br><br><i>O Sugarman done fly away Sugarman done gone Sugarman cut across the sky Sugarman gone home....</i><br><br><br>A few of the half a hundred or so people gathered there nudged each other and sniggered. Others listened as though it were the helpful and defining piano music in a silent movie. They stood this way for some time, none of them crying out to Mr. Smith, all of them preoccupied with one or the other of the minor events about them, until the hospital people came.<br><br>They had been watching from the windows&#151;at first with mild curiosity, then, as the crowd seemed to swell to the very walls of the hospital, they watched with apprehension. They wondered if one of those things that racial-uplift groups were always organizing was taking place. But when they saw neither placards nor speakers, they ventured outside into the cold&#58; white-coated surgeons, dark-jacketed business and personnel clerks, and three nurses in starched jumpers.<br><br>The sight of Mr. Smith and his wide blue wings transfixed them for a few seconds, as did the woman's singing and the roses strewn about. Some of them thought briefly that this was probably some form of worship. Philadelphia, where Father Divine reigned, wasn't all that far away. Perhaps the young girls holding baskets of flowers were two of his virgins. But the laughter of a gold-toothed man brought them back to their senses. They stopped daydreaming and swiftly got down to business, giving orders. Their shouts and bustling caused great confusion where before there had been only a few men and some girls playing with pieces of velvet and a woman singing.<br><br>One of the nurses, hoping to bring some efficiency into the disorder, searched the faces around her until she saw a stout woman who looked as though she might move the earth if she wanted to.<br><br>&quot;You,&quot; she said, moving toward the stout woman. &quot;Are these your children?&quot;<br><br>The stout woman turned her head slowly, her eyebrows lifted at the carelessness of the address. Then, seeing where the voice came from, she lowered her brows and veiled her eyes.<br><br>&quot;Ma'am?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Send one around back to the emergency office. Tell him to tell the guard to get over here quick. That boy there can go. That one.&quot; She pointed to a cat-eyed boy about five or six years old.<br><br>The stout woman slid her eyes down the nurse's finger and looked at the child she was pointing to.<br><br>&quot;Guitar, ma'am.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Guitar.&quot;<br><br>The nurse gazed at the stout woman as though she had spoken Welsh. Then she closed her mouth, looked again at the cat-eyed boy, and lacing her fingers, spoke her next words very slowly to him.<br><br>&quot;Listen. Go around to the back of the hospital to the guard's office. It will say 'Emergency Admissions' on the door. A-D-M-I-S-I-O-N-S. But the guard will be there. Tell him to get over here&#151; on the double. Move now. Move!&quot; She unlaced her fingers and made scooping motions with her hands, the palms pushing against the wintry air.<br><br>A man in a brown suit came toward her, puffing little white clouds of breath. &quot;Fire truck's on its way. Get back inside. You'll freeze to death.&quot;<br><br>The nurse nodded.<br><br>&quot;You left out a <i>s</i>, ma'am,&quot; the boy said. The North was new to him and he had just begun to learn he could speak up to white people. But she'd already gone, rubbing her arms against the cold.<br><br>&quot;Granny, she left out a <i>s</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And a 'please.' &quot;<br><br>&quot;You reckon he'll jump?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A nutwagon do anything.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who is he?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Collects insurance. A nutwagon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who is that lady singing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That, baby, is the very last thing in pea-time.&quot; But she smiled when she looked at the singing woman, so the cat-eyed boy listened to the musical performance with at least as much interest as he devoted to the man flapping his wings on top of the hospital.<br><br>The crowd was beginning to be a little nervous now that the law was being called in. They each knew Mr. Smith. He came to their houses twice a month to collect one dollar and sixty-eight cents and write down on a little yellow card both the date and their eighty-four cents a week payment. They were always half a month or so behind, and talked endlessly to him about paying ahead&#151;after they had a preliminary discussion about what he was doing back so soon anyway.<br><br>&quot;You back in here already? Look like I just got rid of you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm tired of seeing your face. Really tired.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I knew it. Soon's I get two dimes back to back, here you come. More regular than the reaper. Do Hoover know about you?&quot;<br><br>They kidded him, abused him, told their children to tell him they were out or sick or gone to Pittsburgh. But they held on to those little yellow cards as though they meant something&#151;laid them gently in the shoe box along with the rent receipts, marriage licenses, and expired factory identification badges. Mr. Smith smiled through it all, managing to keep his eyes focused almost the whole time on his customers' feet. He wore a business suit for his work, but his house was no better than theirs. He never had a woman that any of them knew about and said nothing in church but an occasional &quot;Amen.&quot; He never beat anybody up and he wasn't seen after dark, so they thought he was probably a nice man. But he was heavily associated with illness and death, neither of which was distinguishable from the brown picture of the North Carolina Mutual Life Building on the back of their yellow cards. Jumping from the roof of Mercy was the most interesting thing he had done. None of them had suspected he had it in him. Just goes to show, they murmured to each other, you never really do know about people.<br><br>The singing woman quieted down and, humming the tune, walked through the crowd toward the rose-petal lady, who was still cradling her stomach.<br><br>&quot;You should make yourself warm,&quot; she whispered to her, touching her lightly on the elbow. &quot;A little bird'll be here with the morning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot; said the rose-petal lady. &quot;Tomorrow morning?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That's the only morning coming.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It can't be,&quot; the rose-petal lady said. &quot;It's too soon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No it ain't. Right on time.&quot;<br><br>The women were looking deep into each other's eyes when a loud roar went up from the crowd&#151;a kind of wavy <i>oo</i> sound. Mr. Smith had lost his balance for a second, and was trying gallantly to hold on to a triangle of wood that jutted from the cupola. Immediately the singing woman began again&#58;<br><br><br><i>O Sugarman done fly O Sugarman done gone . . .</i><br><br><br>Downtown the firemen pulled on their greatcoats, but when they arrived at Mercy, Mr. Smith had seen the rose petals, heard the music, and leaped on into the air.<br><br><br><br>The next day a colored baby was born inside Mercy for the first time. Mr. Smith's blue silk wings must have left their mark, because when the little boy discovered, at four, the same thing Mr. Smith had learned earlier&#151;that only birds and airplanes could fly&#151;he lost all interest in himself. To have to live without that single gift saddened him and left his imagination so bereft that he appeared dull even to the women who did not hate his mother. The ones who did, who accepted her invitations to tea and envied the doctor's big dark house of twelve rooms and the green sedan, called him &quot;peculiar.&quot; The others, who knew that the house was more prison than palace, and that the Dodge sedan was for Sunday drives only, felt sorry for Ruth Foster and her dry daughters, and called her son &quot;deep.&quot; Even mysterious.<br><br>&quot;Did he come with a caul?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You should have dried it and made him some tea from it to drink. If you don't he'll see ghosts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You believe that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don't, but that's what the old people say.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, he's a deep one anyway. Look at his eyes.&quot;<br><br>And they pried pieces of baked-too-fast sunshine cake from the roofs of their mouths and looked once more into the boy's eyes. He met their gaze as best he could until, after a pleading glance toward his mother, he was allowed to leave the room.<br><br>It took some planning to walk out of the parlor, his back washed with the hum of their voices, open the heavy double doors leading to the dining room, slip up the stairs past all those bedrooms, and not arouse the attention of Lena and Corinthians sitting like big baby dolls before a table heaped with scraps of red velvet. His sisters made roses in the afternoon. Bright, lifeless roses that lay in peck baskets for months until the specialty buyer at Gerhardt's sent Freddie the janitor over to tell the girls that they could use another gross. If he did manage to slip by his sisters and avoid their casual malice, he knelt in his room at the window sill and wondered again and again why he had to stay level on the ground. The quiet that suffused the doctor's house then, broken only by the murmur of the women eating sunshine cake, was only that&#58; quiet. It was not peaceful, for it was preceded by and would soon be terminated by the presence of Macon Dead.<br><br><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="product-related"><div class="btb-dsl-tc"><div class="btb-dsl-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-tc-acc"><div class="pr-width"><div class="wrap2lt"><h3 class="pr-selected accord-default-open"><a name="relatedAcc" href="#categoryTitle_Acc" data-cmelementid="Related Subjects_Accordion">Related Subjects</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on"><ul><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=971455">African Americans - Fiction &amp; Literature</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=18">Family &amp; Friendship - Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=901706">American Fiction</a></li></ul></div><div class="wrap2lt booksByThisAuthor"><h3 class="pr-selected"><a name="booksByThisAuthorAcc" href="#booksByThisAuthor_Acc" data-cmelementid="BooksByThisAuthor_Accordion" onclick="WebService.initialize({url:'http://services.barnesandnoble.com/v02_00/ProductSearch?Contributor=Toni+Morrison&amp;ProductType=Book&amp;ProductSort=Relevance&amp;ProductDetail=Brief&amp;Start=1&amp;Size=6&amp;AppId=bntemp&amp;bnoutput=jsonstring&amp;bncallback=webservicecallback', outputNode:document.getElementById('obbta'), StyleSheet:genericStyleSheet, moreLink:'http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Toni+Morrison', isBTOB:'false', ean:'9781400033423'});">More by This Author</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on" id="obbta"><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif" alt="loading animation"> loading...
