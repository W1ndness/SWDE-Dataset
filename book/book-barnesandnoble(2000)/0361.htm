Taking readers past the yellow brick road and into a phantasmagoric world rich with imagination and allegory, Wicked just might change the reputation of one of the most sinister characters in literature.</p><h3>Newsday</h3><p>Listen up, Munchkins.  Stop your singing, stop the dancing.  The Wicked Witch is no longer dead.  But not to worry.  Gregory Maguire&#39;s shrewdly imagined and beautifully written first novel, "Wicked&#58;  The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West," not only revives her but re-envisions and redeems her for our times.

											This was an awesome fantasy read!  The Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba is a very deep and intelligent person more than you'd ever expect.   I found her and the others very stimulating and amazing--very detailed and political as well. It is a wonderful addition to my library and I'd really plan on rereading it again.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35703696.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Gregory Maguire</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Boston, Massachusetts</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>June 09, 1954</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Albany, New York</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A., SUNY at Albany, 1976; M.A., Simmons College, 1978; Ph.D., Tufts University, 1990</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.gregorymaguire.com">* Gregory Maguire's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Raised in a family of writers (his father was a journalist and his stepmother a poet), Gregory Maguire grew up with a great love of books, especially fairy tales and fantasy fiction. He composed his own stories from an early age and released his first book for children, <I>The Lightning Time</I>,  in 1978, just two years after graduating from the State University of New York at Albany. <p>    Several other children's book followed, but major recognition eluded Maguire. Then, in 1995, he published his first adult novel. A bold, revisionist view of Frank L. Baum's classic Oz stories, <I>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</I>  places one of literature's most reviled characters at the center of a dark dystopian fantasy and raises provocative questions about the very nature of good and evil. Purists criticized Maguire for tampering with a beloved juvenile classic, but the book received generally good reviews (John Updike, writing in <i>The New Yorker</I>, proclaimed it "an amazing novel.") and the enthusiasm of readers catapulted it to the top of the bestseller charts. (Maguire's currency increased even further when the book was turned into the  Tony Award-winning  Broadway musical <i>Wicked</I> in 2003.) <p>    In the wake of his breakthrough novel, Maguire has made something of a specialty out of turning classic children's tales on their heads. He retold the legends of Cinderella and Snow White in <i>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</i> (1999) and <i>Mirror, Mirror</i> (2003); he raised the ghost of Ebenezer Scrooge in <i>Lost</I> (2001); and, in 2005, he returned to Oz for <i>Son of a Witch</I>, the long-awaited sequel to <i>Wicked</i>. He has reviewed fantasy fiction for the Sunday <I>New York Times Book Review</I> and has contributed his own articles, essays, and stories to publications like <I>Ploughshares</I>, <I>The Boston Review</I>, the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>,  and <I>The Horn Book Magazine</I>.<p>     In addition, Maguire has never lost his interest in -- or enthusiasm for -- children's literature. He is the author of The Hamlet Chronicles, a bestselling seven-book series of  high-camp mystery-adventures with silly count-down titles like <i>Seven Spiders Spinning</I> and  <i>Three Rotten Eggs</I>. He has taught at the Center for the Study of Children's Literature at Simmons College and is a founding member of Children's Literature New England (CLNE), a nonprofit organization that focuses attention on the significance of literature in the lives of children.<p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>In our interview, Maguire shared some fun facts with us about his life</I>: <p>    <b>"While I pride myself on trying to be creative</b> in all areas of my life, I have occasionally gone overboard, like the time I decided to bring to a party a salad that I constructed, on a huge rattan platter, to look like a miniature scale model of the Gardens of Babylon. I built terraces with chunks of Monterey jack, had a forest of broccoli florets and a lagoon of Seven Seas salad dressing spooned into a half a honeydew melon. I made reed patches out of scallion tips and walkways out of sesame seeds lined with raisin borders. Driving to the party, I had to brake to avoid a taxi, and by the time the police flagged me down for poor driving skills I was nearly weeping. �But Officer, I have a quickly decomposing Hanging Gardens of Babylon to deliver....' Everything had slopped and fallen over and it looked like a tray of vegetable garbage." <p>    <b>"My first job was scooping ice cream at Friendly's in Albany, New York.</b> I hated the work, most of my colleagues, and the uniform, and I more or less lost my taste for ice cream permanently." <p>    <b>"If I hadn't been a writer, I would have tried to be one of the following:</b> An artist (watercolors), a singer/songwriter like Paul Simon (taller but not very much more), an architect (domestic), a teacher. Actually, in one way or another I have done all of the above, but learned pretty quickly that my skills needed more honing for me to charge for my services, and I'd always rather write fiction than hone skills." <p>     <b>"I steal a bit from one of my favorite writers to say, simply,</b> that I enjoy, most of all, old friends and new places. I love to travel. Having small children at home now impedes my efforts a great deal, but I have managed in my time to get to Asia, Africa, most of Europe, and Central America. My wish list of places not yet visited includes India, Denmark, Brazil, and New Zealand, and my wish for friends not yet made includes, in a sense, readers who are about to discover my work, either now or even when I'm no longer among the living. In a sense, in anticipation, I value those friends in a special way."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2003, Gregory Maguire took some time out to talk with us about some of his favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  While I didn't know it at the time, eventually I have come to believe that T. H. White's <I>The Once and Future King</I> was the most influential book. I observed in it several admirable attributes that I try to make hallmarks of my own work. First, the book is derived from a popular set of myths and commonly held stories that form part of our Western foundation myth (the King Arthur stories). Second, the book is by turns profound, endearing, and comical. Third, the story is unwieldy in a way that seems organic and special. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>    <li><I>Unleaving</I> by Jill Paton Walsh -- This award-winning novel for young adults comes closer to being a true "novel of ideas" than any other book for the young I've ever read, including <I>A Separate Peace</I> and <I>The Catcher in the Rye</I> (neither of which were published for the young originally, it must be admitted). The novel is sensuous, moral, dramatic, and makes a great case for the excitement of intellectual inquiry. It also is brisk, gloriously written, and evocative of Virginia Woolf (the author spent her formative years, during the Blitz, living a quarter mile down the hill from where Woolf, as a young child, had spent summers, gazing out at the lighthouse at Godrevy in Cornwall). <p>    <li><I>The Towers of the Trebizond</I> by Rose Macaulay -- My stepmother recommended this book and I tried it three times, revising  my estimate of my stepmother's taste in literature with each abandoned attempt I made. The fourth time I was old enough to apprehend the humor in the tone, and then the story rolled with furious comedy to its startling conclusion. I have never reread this book, but I have meant to for 20 years, and I hold it fondly in memory. <p>    <li><I>The Diamond in the Window</I> by Jane Langton -- This is a children's fantasy first published in the middle 1960s. The wry line drawings by Erik Blegvad add to the story's depth and humanity as two orphaned children pursue their missing relatives through a series of dreams that enlarge their transcendental sensibilities and coalesce their family. <p>    <li><I>Human Voices</I> by Penelope Fitzgerald -- I'd read one novel by Fitzgerald and found it rather damp and dispiriting, but when I came to this I was rewarded. Though it takes a while to digest the use of acronyms for two of the main characters (they go by the initials associated with their business titles) that small effort is worth it. The novel takes place during the Blitz in London, as members of the BBC struggle to broadcast under trying circumstances.<p>    <li><I>Morality Play</I> by Barry Unsworth -- This novel takes place in the 13th century, as I remember, and brilliantly imagines nothing less than the birth of the novel, happening more or less simultaneously with the end of feudalism and the growth of the understanding of particular character, one person at a time. <p>    <li><I>Howards End</I> by E. M. Forster -- I selected this book only because I had to select something. Indeed, I'm a fan of all of Forster's work, no matter what can (and often is) said about his lack of sympathy or ability to portray real female characters. In general his sensitivity to the small but urgent moral questions of his day, especially relating to individual moral choice in the context of wider social pressures, continues to delight and inform me. His prose style is understated and affectionately comic most of the time, too, which I admire. <p>    <li><I>To the Lighthouse</I> by Virginia Woolf -- Likewise, I might have chosen <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I>, or <I>The Waves</I>, or even <I>Between the Acts</I> as my favorite, but <I>To the Lighthouse</I> is my selection mostly because it was in reading this novel (not my first Woolf experience) that I first realized the range and nature of her genius. <p>    <li><I>Harriet the Spy</I> by Louise Fitzhugh -- A children's novel by someone who might well have written for <I>The New Yorker</I> in the '60s, given her mildly acid tone and her keen eye for the telling moment. This novel of a precocious sixth-grade girl and the diary she keeps (and loses to her friends) made me roar with laughter as a child but also inspired in me what is, by now, a  33-year habit of keeping my own journal. And keeping a childhood journal was a vast part of my own development as a writer. <p>    <li><I>The Children of Knowe</I> by L. M. Boston -- This is the first "chapter" book I ever read. I was in second grade (I was a precocious reader myself). The book has rather little by way of plot, but was my introduction to literary atmosphere and also, I suppose, the seeding of a lifelong love of literature written by English writers. (Seven of these ten recommendations are by English writers.) I also eventually went to live in London, and -- memorably -- had tea with the author at her home in Cambridgeshire. The manor house in which she lived, and about which she wrote in this book and its sequels, is the oldest continually occupied domestic dwelling in England. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>    I'm not as much of a film buff as I am a reader, but, with apologies for my perhaps less than startling choices: <p>    <li><I>The Wizard of Oz</I> -- Naturally!  <li><I>The Sixth Sense</I> For its deft plotting.  <li><I>The Crying Game</I> -- For the same reason.  <li><I>Babette's Feast</I> -- The only movie I can watch repeatedly and tear up at the end, without fail.  <li><I>The Sound of Music</I> -- Because it made being Catholic and being musical synonymous, which my experience as an altar boy in a Catholic church had not revealed to me.  <li>Franco Zeffirelli's <I>Romeo and Juliet</I> -- I'm not sure what I'd think of it now, but I loved it as a teenage boy and have never forgotten many scenes of it.   <li><I>Topsy Turvy</I> -- Mike Leigh's Gilbert and Sullivan homage. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I like classical music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and I adore Bach above all. The late Beethoven string quartets satisfy through their modernity, and they make the symphonies look like the work of a very talented adolescent. I listen to jazz (on the radio) and to Portuguese fado and, when on long trips in the car alone, to original-cast recordings of Broadway musicals. I listen to nothing when I write. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  I would force the book club to read all of Dorothy Sayers, as I have read almost nothing of her and I am eager to be well educated enough to read Jill Paton Walsh's continuation of the Peter Wimsey stories. <p>    What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?  Increasingly I like books of reference, to get, especially older dictionaries and lists of place names and common surnames etc. Such tomes are helpful in constructing a story with verisimilitude. I like to give autographed novels as presents. <p>       <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have too much on my desk while writing. Usually file folders having to do with household repairs (the air conditioning is broken at the moment). I sit under a 1950s-era reproduction calendar portraying a Punchinello character eating a huge plate of pasta, and the instruction below in orangey letters is "MANGIA!" So this reminds me that I write, in part, to eat. With three small children at home, I have no ritual except to write when I can, when they're looking the other way.<p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b>  I rather shockingly sold my first manuscript to Farrar Straus, and it was published -- a chapter book for the 12-to-15 set -- a quarter of a century ago. However it took me 17 years to write a book that would make me any money or earn me any attention as a writer. That was <I>Wicked</I>, which was written while I lived in London in the early 1990s. I had had the idea some years earlier -- to invent a whole life for a very famous and hugely unexplored character -- and when what the English call "financial embarrassment" set in, I decided it was now or never. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I believe hugely in the value of a journal to keep oneself honest as well as in practice. I also think, though, when the well runs dry for a while you oughtn't berate yourself. <p>  --------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>  <I>In the summer of 2004, we asked authors featured in Meet the Writers to give us a list of their all-time favorite summer reads, and tell us what makes them just right for the season. Here's what Gregory Maguire had to say: </I> <p>    <li><I>Unleaving</I> by Jill Paton Walsh -- This is a novel published originally for teenagers but reissued (in England anyway) as part of a two-novella volume for adult readers. Teens and adults alike will take much from it. It is set between the wars in England, at a summer home in St. Ives, Cornwall. A party of young students in the last summer before going up to Oxford gathers in a holiday venue to read, discuss, and to witness a tragedy of extraordinary moment. The final few pages of the novel (no fair skipping head, they won't work the same magic if excised!) are among my favorite words in all of English literature. It is a sober book, but sun-drenched and memorable, like the best of vacations. <p>    <li><I>The Once and Future King</I> by T. H. White -- Perhaps you read this when younger. It holds up. Look in again. What you may forget is how very smart it is about human nature. The deft shift of tones from comic to tragic, intellectual to romantic, fantastic to historic, has rarely been done better. You come away with a sense that no effort has been spared. This book, more than any other, was the prototype I used when conceiving how to write my novel, <I>Wicked</I>.<p>    <li><I>Morality Play</I> by Barry Unsworth -- I first read this five or six years ago. I got about a third of the way through, thinking "oh, a pleasant Brother Cadfael-type entertainment," when the book suddenly began to raise big issues in a big way. I thought: "Holy moley. I was wrong. This isn't an entertainment. This is a serious novel. I don't want to miss a thing." So I went back to the beginning and started over. Yes, it is entertaining (though I hear the movie based on it, with a different title, is less than wonderful), but it is also riveting morally and intellectually. It is about nothing so much as the birth of the individual consciousness and the birth of the novel--the idea that everyone's got a story, not just the ennobled or the sainted.<p>    <li><I>Mariette in Ecstasy</I> by Ron Hansen -- I was in Cambodia adopting my second son, and to still him I wandered up and down the halls of the Sunway Hotel in Phnom Penh, and murmured the soft lines of Hansen's elliptical, poetic prose to calm the baby. The book is about an early twentieth-century young novice experiencing stigmata and having devotional hot flashes. It is about passion, but is neither lewd nor dismissive of piety. The only problem with this book is that it will ruin the next four or five novels for you. It is that good. <p>    <li><I>Magic by the Lake</I> by Edward Eager -- A children's fantasy -- not the most famous of the Edward Eager books (that would be <I>Half Magic</I>). This is <I>Half Magic</I>'s sequel. Good summer reading because it takes place at a summer cabin in some cheesy peduncle resort, probably the 1920's though readers young and old won't get stuck in antique vernacular. It is, I think, the funniest of this very funny writer's books, and what could be better to read under a layer of Coppertone than <I>Magic by the Lake</I>? Isn't that why we go on holidays anyway? Remember to use the high-strength sunblock, by the way.<p>    <li><I>The Swing in the Summerhouse</I> by Jane Langton -- Another children's fantasy, and another one that takes place over a summer. Pay especial attention to the crisp line drawings by that underrated master of the type, Erik Blegvad. The story is by Concord's quirky apologist, Jane Langton, perhaps better known to the world at large as the author of the Homer Kelly mysteries for adults. This story takes two loosely guarded siblings through a series of fantastic episodes that point up the virtues and the perils of growing up -- something that in summer we all try to forget we're still doing. <p>    <li><I>The Hounds of the Morrigan</I> by Pat O'Shea -- I suppose my hand is being shown here. I love fantasy, and fantasy for children seems somehow more convincing than most fantasy for adults. <I>The Hounds of the Morrigan</I> is a grand comic tapestry of a novel, set in Ireland. Two siblings set out across Ireland in some rosily-remembered summer past, and the cast of characters they meet will have you laughing out loud and drowning out Howard Stern on the radio on the blanket next door. <p>    <li><I>Bat 6</I> by Virginia Euwer Wolff -- Want something less frolicy, but still fast-moving and summer-tinged? Baseball will serve. This is a novel about girls' baseball teams in the mid-century, the cost of war, the cost of apology. Loan this to your teenage reader and then grab it back again as soon as he or she is done. The author has laser-sharp control of her characters and the questions raised will be revisited around the dying coals of the hibachi well into the evening.<p>    <li><I>Senseless</I> by Stona Fitch -- All right, this is not for everyone. I'll be up front about that. But if you, like me, want your vacation to be a time in which you remember what the world is like and come to terms with it better -- rather than flinching at the headlines all year long and looking away -- <I>Senseless</I> is for you. It is about the kidnapping and torture of a mid-level American businessman in Europe. It is graphic and it is violent, but it is not excessive. Not for the weak-stomached nor for the sentimental. But you won't forget it. It may be the best book you read this summer.<p>    <li><I>The Keeping-Room</I> by Betty Levin -- For a change of pace, try this: get it from the library if your local bookstore hasn't got it in paperback. <I>The Keeping-Room</I> is a mystery for teenagers; adults will be riveted too, because of the understated and sympathetic characterizations. It involves a kidnapped child and a century-old mystery unearthed during a high school boy's local history project. The atmosphere of trendy New England suburbia is cuttingly evoked, and the pace is fast and the payoff worth it.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L.

</div><a name="RGG"></a><h3>Reading Group Guide</h3><b>Our Book Club Recommendation</b><br> 
It's hard to pin down the aspect of Gregory Maguire's <I>Wicked</I> that is likely to fascinate book clubs the most.  Is it the detail with which the author reimagines L. Frank Baum's fantasy world of Oz?  The care with which Maguire takes the classic work and uses it to explore modern issues like justice and equal rights, superficial notions of beauty and ugliness, ecological concerns and domestic violence?  Or, perhaps, is it the sheer delight in watching an immensely gifted writer take a set of familiar characters and imbue them with an entirely new life.<p>

Of course, it is the Wicked Witch of the West herself who dominates this time around: Elphaba, as she is called, is now the complicated centerpiece of a story that once seemed to belong to the relatively simple Dorothy. Brilliant, troubled, passionate, and powerful, Elphaba stands in marked contrast to the girl from Kansas, who, on the whole, takes a backseat to the natives of Oz in this version.  Maguire's method with Elphaba's tale is to unpack the simple idea of a "wicked witch" and ask the question, How do you get to be "wicked"?  The novel offers the possibility that what from one perspective is a simple case of villainy could be, from another point of view, a life that doesn't resolve into a simple set of "good" or  "bad" actions.  Book clubs will be particularly interested in following how, as a heroine, Elphaba is a strong, deeply modern woman, whose intelligence is both her great strength and a curse almost as powerful as her more fantastic features, emerald skin and monstrous teeth.<p>

Beyond the issues of moral character raised by Elphaba's story, <I>Wicked</I> provides readers with a host of delights, some of which echo the original Oz books and some of which are completely original.  Reading groups will find that Maguire's language, and particularly his facility for making the world of Oz both contemporary yet fairy tale&#150;like, provides fertile grounds for conversation about just where the difference between the "fantastic" and the "realistic" can be drawn, a skill which may invite comparisons to writers like Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez and Salman Rushdie. <p>

Reading groups will perhaps find their greatest pleasure in discussing what  Maguire has taken  from the original book, and how he has altered or mutated Baum's world.  Book clubs may even be interested in comparing the famed film version of <I>The Wizard of Oz</I> with the novel, to see what the author has borrowed from that source.  In this sense <I>Wicked</I> is far more than a cleverly twisted tale about good and evil witches, Munchkin society, and talking animals -- it is a book that shows how a children's story can become a larger myth for an entire society.  Maguire invites us to think about how and why we read fantasy, what we take from it as children, and what we can see in it as adults.  <I>Wicked</I> may be "updating" L. Frank Baum's original work, but it also reveals how the original remains so captivating to generations of readers, young and old.  <I>Bill Tipper</I><p>


<b>Reading Group Materials from the Publisher</b><br>
<i>Summary</i><p> When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum's classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?<p></p> Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. <i>Wicked</i> is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil. <p></p> <i>Questions for Discussion</i> <LI> Gregory Maguire fashioned the name of Elphaba (pronounced EL-fa-ba) from the initials of the author of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, Lyman Frank Baum-L-F-B-Elphaba. <i>Wicked</i> derives some of its power from the popularity of its source material. Does meeting up with familiar characters and famous fictional situations require more patience and effort on the part of the reader, or less? <P><LI> <i>Wicked</i> flips the Oz we knew from the classic movie on its head. To what extent does Maguire's vision of Oz contradict the Oz we're familiar with? How have Dorothy and the other characters changed or remained the same? Has <i>Wicked</i> changed your conception of the original? If so, how? <P><LI> The novel opens with a scene in which the Witch overhears Dorothy, the Lion, the Scarecrow, and theTin Woodman gossiping about her. She's "possessed by demons," they say. "She was castrated at birth . . . she was an abused child . . . she's a dangerous tyrant." How does this scene set the stage for the story, and what themes does it introduce? <P><LI> What is the significance of Elphaba's green skin? What are the rewards of being so different, and what are the drawbacks? In Oz -- and in the real world -- what are the meanings associated with the color green, and are any of them pertinent to Elphaba's character? <P><LI> One of <i>Wicked</i>'s key themes is the nature and roots of evil. What are the theories that Maguire sets out? Is Elphaba evil? Are her actions evil? Is there such a thing as evil, a free-floating power in the universe like time or gravity? Or is evil an attribute of the actions of human beings? (Hint: Turn to pages 231 and 370 for scenes that will draw you into the conversation.) <P><LI> Discuss the importance of the Clock of the Time Dragon. Does the Clock simply reflect events, or does it shape them? Why is it significant that Elphaba was born inside it? That Turtle Heart was killed by it? What revelations does it offer to Elphaba and the reader when she reencounters it at the end of the book? <P><LI> The first section of the book ends powerfully but enigmatically when the young Elphaba is discovered under the dock, cradled in the paws of a magical beast as if sitting on a throne. How do you interpret this scene, and what do you think it foretells, if anything? <P><LI> The place of Animals in society is an important theme in <i>Wicked</i>. Why does Elphaba make it her mission to fight for Animal rights? How else does social class define Oz, and why? <P><LI> [Galinda] reasoned that because she was beautiful she was significant, though what she signified, and to whom, was not clear to her yet" (page 65). Discuss the transformation of Galinda, shallow Shiz student, to Glinda the Good Witch. How does she change -- and by how much? What is her eventual "significance," both in Oz and in the story? <P><LI> Discuss the ways in which Elphaba's determination and willfulness lend purpose and order to her life, and the cost of being such a strong character. Elphaba isn't the only strong female character in <i>Wicked</i>. How do Nessarose, Glinda, and Sarima deal with the issues of power and control? Where do each of them draw strength from? Is the world of Maguire's Oz more or less patriarchal than millennial America? <P><LI> <i>Wicked</i> is an epic story, built along the lines of a Shakespearean or Greek tragedy, in which the seeds of Elphaba's destiny are all sown early in the novel. How much of Elphaba's career is predestined, and how much choice does she have? Do you think that she was no more than a puppet of the Wizard or Madame Morrible, as she fears? <P><LI> Early in their unlikely friendship, Galinda catches a glimpse of Elphaba and thinks she "looked like something between an animal and an Animal, like something more than life but not quite Life" (pages 78-79). Discuss the dual, and sometimes contradictory, nature of Elphaba's character. Why does Elphaba insist that she doesn't have a soul? <P><LI> Who or what is Yackle? Where does she appear in the story, and what role does she serve in Elphaba's life? Is she good or evil -- both or neither? <P><LI> Was Elphaba's story essentially a tragedy or a triumph? Did she fail at every major endeavor, and thus fail at life; or because she refused to give up or change to suit the opinions of others, was her life a success? Is there a possibility that Dorothy's "baptismal splash" redeemed Elphaba on her deathbed, or was this the final indignity in a life of miserable mistakes? </ol>

Look how low I've gone." </P> <P>"Today? That would be like you, perverse and inconvenient," said her husband, teasing her, standing at the doorway and looking outward, over the lake, the fields, the forested slopes beyond. He could just make out the chimneys of Rush Margins, breakfast fires smoking. "The worst possible moment for my ministry. Naturally." </P> <P>The wife yawned. "There's not a lot of choice involved. From what I hear. Your body gets this big and it takes over&#8212;if you can't accommodate it, sweetheart, you just get out of its way. It's on a track of its own and nothing stops it <I>now</I>." She pushed herself up, trying to see over the rise of her belly. "I feel like a hostage to myself. Or to the baby." </P> <P>"Exert some self-control." He came to her side and helped her sit up. "Think of it as a spiritual exercise. Custody of the senses. Bodily as well as ethical continence." </P> <P>"Self-control?" She laughed, inching toward the edge of the bed. "I have no self left. I'm only a host for the parasite. Where's my <I>self</I>, anyway? Where'd I leave that tired old thing?" </P> <P>"Think of me." His tone had changed; he meant this. </P> <P>"Frex"&#8212;she headed him off&#8212;"when the volcano's ready there's no priest in the world can pray it quiet." </P> <P>"What will my fellow ministers think?" </P> <P>"They'll get together and say, 'Brother Frexspar, did you allow your wife to deliver your first child when you had a community problem to solve? How inconsiderate of you;it shows a lack of authority. You're fired from the position.'" She was ribbing him now, for there was no one to fire him. The nearest bishop was too distant to pay attention to the particulars of a unionist cleric in the hinterland. </P> <P>"It's just such terrible timing." </P> <P>"I do think you bear half the blame for the timing," she said. "I mean, after all, Frex." </P> <P>"That's how the thinking goes, but I wonder," </P> <P>"You wonder?" She laughed, her head going far back. The line from her ear to the hollow below her throat reminded Frex of an elegant silver ladle. Even in morning disarray, with a belly like a scow, she was majestically good-looking. Her hair had the bright lacquered look of wet fallen oak leaves in sunlight. He blamed her for being born to privilege and admired her efforts to overcome it&#8212;and all the while he loved her, too. </P> <P>"You mean you wonder if you're the father"&#8212;she grabbed the bedstead; Frex took hold of her other arm and hauled her half-upright&#8212;"or do you question the fatherliness of men in general?" She stood, mammoth, an ambulatory island. Moving out the door at a slug's pace, she laughed at such an idea. He could hear her laughing from the outhouse even as he began to dress for the day's battle. </P> <P>Frex combed his beard and oiled his scalp. He fastened a clasp of bone and rawhide at the nape of his neck, to keep the hair out of his face, because his expressions today had to be readable from a distance: There could be no fuzziness to his meaning. He applied some coal dust to darken his eyebrows, a smear of red wax on his flat cheeks. He shaded his lips, A handsome priest attracted more penitents than a homely one. </P> <P>In the kitchen yard Melena floated gently, not with the normal gravity of pregnancy but as if inflated, a huge balloon trailing its strings through the dirt. She carried a skillet in one hand and a few eggs and the whiskery tips of autumn chives in the other. She sang to herself, but only in short phrases. Frex wasn't meant to hear her. </P> <P>His sober gown buttoned tight to the collar, his sandals strapped on over leggings, Frex took from its hiding place&#8212;beneath a chest of drawers&#8212;the report sent to him from his fellow minister over in the village of Three Dead Trees. He hid the brown pages within his sash. He had been keeping them from his wife, afraid that she would want to come along&#8212;to see the fun, if it was amusing, or to suffer the thrill of it if it was terrifying. </P> <P>As Frex breathed deeply, readying his lungs for a day of oratory, Melena dangled a wooden spoon in the skillet and stirred the eggs. The tinkle of cowbells sounded across the lake. She did not listen; or she listened but to something else, to something inside her. It was sound without melody&#8212;like dream music, remembered for its effect but not for its harmonic distresses and recoveries. She imagined it was the child inside her, humming for happiness. She knew he would be a singing child. </P> <P>Melena heard Frex inside, beginning to extemporize, warming up, calling forth the rolling phrases of his argument, convincing himself again of his righteousness. </P> <P>How did that proverb go, the one that Nanny singsonged to her, years ago, in the nursery? </P>  <blockquote> <P>Born in the morning, <BR> Woe without warning; <BR> Afternoon child<BR> Woeful and wild; <BR> Born in the evening, <BR> Woe ends in grieving. <BR> Night baby borning<BR> Same as the morning. </P> </blockquote>  <P>But she remembered this as a joke, fondly. Woe is the natural end of life, yet we go on having babies. </P> <P>No, said Nanny, an echo in Melena's mind (and editorializing as usual): No, no, you pretty little pampered hussy. We <I>don't</I> go on having babies, that's quite apparent. We only have babies when we're young enough not to know how grim life turns out. Once we really get the full measure of it&#8212;we're slow learners, we women&#8212;we dry up in disgust and sensibly halt production. </P> <P>But men don't dry up, Melena objected; they can father to the death. </P> <P>Ah, we're slow learners, Nanny countered. But <I>they</I> can't learn at all. </P> <P>"Breakfast," said Melena, spooning eggs onto a wooden plate. Her son would not be as dull as most men. She would raise him up to defy the onward progress of woe. </P> <P>"It is a time of crisis for our society," recited Frex. For a man who condemned worldly pleasures he ate with elegance. She loved to watch the arabesque of fingers and two forks.
