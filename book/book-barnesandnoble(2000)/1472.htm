											While I enjoy this series I find it hard to believe that so many diverse characters live in this town with such evil thoughts.  As the reader, we can hear the jealousies which makes you suspect the motives of everyone.  My favorite character, Ruth is not likeable in the least but I find her loveable in a prickly way.  Her scenes with the goslings in this story are unforgetable.  My least favorite characters are Beauvoir and Peter, who I think must do something really devastating in later books.  The author does a good job taking the reader from the small town atmosphere of Three Pines to the Judiciary in Montreal.  Having driven in the northern areas of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine I found that the description of the potholes actually made my kidneys hurt.  I recommend this one for a day when you have several hours to read.  It easily will fill your afternoon.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Comeback/Dick-Francis/e/9780425233313/?pv=y">Comeback</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>recommended highly<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=carol68">carol68</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1311916_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780312944506_BK_1_1311916" href="#previewReview_1311916" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>February 20, 2010:

 - 
								Library Journal</h3><p><P>The Quebecois village of Three Pines (first introduced in <i>Still Life</i>and <i>Fatal Grace</i>) is once again the scene of a perplexing murder, and Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and his team have caught the case. Madeleine Favreau, a cheerful and well-liked village resident, collapsed and died at an impromptu seance at a local house thought to be haunted. The cause of death is pronounced a high dose of ephedrine and fright. But Madeleine wasn't dieting, so who slipped her the ephedrine? Gamache is an engaging, modern-day Poirot who gently teases out information from his suspects while enjoying marvelous bistro meals and cozy walks on the village common. His team is an unlikely troupe of departmental misfits who blossom under his deft tutelage, turning up just the right clues. Penny is an award-winning writer whose cozies go beyond traditional boundaries, providing entertaining characters, a picturesque locale, and thought-provoking plots. Highly recommended. [See Prepub Mystery, <i>LJ</i>11/1/07.]</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Four statements lead to wisdom, but not before mischief and revenge come into play. The slumberous Quebecois village of Three Pines is about to have its hackles raised. In the spirit of good fun, the owner of the local B&B has arranged for a visiting Hungarian psychic to conduct a seance. She turns out not to be Hungarian and the seance is a dud. Undaunted, the participants plan a sequel at the deserted old Hadley house on the hill, where one of their number is evidently scared to death. How, why and whodunit will fall to Chief Inspector Armand Gamache (A Fatal Grace, 2007, etc.) to discover, his task complicated by the villagers' tendencies to conceal secrets and his own cadre of officers' to work against him in payback for his role in bringing charges against a superior. A mother will disappoint a daughter. A husband will taunt a wife. And a golden girl too good at everything for her own good will wreak havoc on the village while Gamache instructs his subordinates in the path to wisdom: learning to say I don't know, I'm sorry, I was wrong, I need help. Perhaps the deftest talent to arrive since Minette Walters, Penny produces what many have tried but few have mastered: a psychologically acute cozy. If you don't give your heart to Gamache, you may have no heart to give.

Wiping a strand of hair from her face, she smeared bits of grass, mud and some other brown stuff that might not be mud into her tangled hair. All around, villagers wandered with their baskets of brightly colored eggs, looking for the perfect hiding places. Ruth Zardo sat on the bench in the middle of the green tossing the eggs at random, though occasionally she&#8217;d haul off and peg someone in the back of the head or on the bottom. She had disconcertingly good aim for someone so old and so nuts, thought Clara.<BR>&#8216;You going tonight?&#8217; Clara asked, trying to distract the old poet from taking aim at Monsieur B&#233;liveau.<BR>&#8216;Are you kidding? Live people are bad enough; why would I want to bring one back from the dead?&#8217;<BR>With that Ruth whacked Monsieur B&#233;liveau in the back of his head. Fortunately the village grocer was wearing a cloth cap. It was also fortunate he had great affection for the white-haired ramrod on the bench. Ruth chose her victims well. They were almost always people who cared for her.<BR>Normally being pelted by a chocolate Easter egg wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal, but these weren&#8217;t chocolate. They&#8217;d made that mistake only once.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years earlier, when the village of Three Pines first decided to have an egg hunt on Easter Sunday, there&#8217;d been great excitement. The villagers met at Olivier&#8217;s Bistro and over drinks and Brie they divvied up bags of chocolate eggs to be hidden the next day. &#8216;Ooohs&#8217; and&#8216;Aaaaahs&#8217; tinged with envy filled the air. Would that they were children again. But their pleasure would surely come from seeing the faces of the village children. Besides, the kids might not find them all, especially those hidden behind Olivier&#8217;s bar.<BR>&#8216;They&#8217;re gorgeous.&#8217; Gabri picked up a tiny marzipan goose, delicately sculpted, then bit its head off.<BR>&#8216;Gabri.&#8217; His partner Olivier yanked what was left of the goose from Gabri&#8217;s massive hand. &#8216;They&#8217;re for the kids.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;You just want it for yourself.&#8217; Gabri turned to Myrna and muttered so that everyone could hear, &#8216;Great idea. Gay men offering chocolates to children. Let&#8217;s alert the Moral Majority.&#8217;<BR>Blond and bashful, Olivier blushed furiously.<BR>Myrna smiled. She looked like a massive Easter egg herself, black and oval and wrapped in a brilliant purple and red caftan.<BR>Most of the tiny village was at the bistro, crowded around the long bar of polished wood, though some had flopped down in the comfortable old armchairs scattered about. All for sale. Olivier&#8217;s was also an antique shop. Discreet tags dangled from everything, including Gabri when he felt under-appreciated and under-applauded.<BR>It was early April and fires crackled cheerily in the open grates, throwing warm light on the wide-plank pine floors, stained amber by time and sunlight. Waiters moved effortlessly through the beamed room, offering drinks and soft, runny Brie from Monsieur Pag&#233;&#8217;s farm. The bistro was at the heart of the old Quebec village, sitting as it did on the edge of the green. On either side of it and attached by connecting doors were the rest of the shops, hugging the village in an aged brick embrace. Monsieur B&#233;liveau&#8217;s general store, Sarah&#8217;s Boulangerie, then the bistro and finally, just off that, Myrna&#8217;s Livres, Neufs et Usag&#233;s. Three craggy pine trees had stood at the far end of the green for as long as anyone remembered, like wise men who&#8217;d found what they were looking for. Outward from the village, dirt roads radiated and meandered into the mountains and forests.<BR>But Three Pines itself was a village forgotten. Time eddied and swirled and sometimes bumped into it, but never stayed long and never left much of an impression. For hundreds of years the village had nestled in the palm of the rugged Canadian mountains, protected and hidden and rarely found except by accident. Sometimes, a weary traveler crested the hill and looking down saw, like Shangri-La, the welcoming circle of old homes. Some were weathered fieldstone built by settlers clearing the land of deeply rooted trees and back-breaking stones. Others were red brick and built by United Empire Loyalists desperate for sanctuary. And some had the swooping metal roofs of the Qu&#233;b&#233;cois home with their intimate gables and broad verandas. And at the far end was Olivier&#8217;s Bistro, offering caf&#233; au lait and fresh-baked croissants, conversation and company and kindness. Once found, Three Pines was never forgotten. But it was only ever found by people lost.<BR>Myrna looked over at her friend Clara Morrow, who was sticking out her tongue. Myrna stuck hers out too. Clara rolled her eyes. Myrna rolled hers, taking a seat beside Clara on the soft sofa facing the fireplace.<BR>&#8216;You weren&#8217;t smoking garden mulch again while I was in Montreal, were you?&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Not this time,&#8217; Clara laughed. &#8216;You have something on your nose.&#8217;<BR>Myrna felt around, found something and examined it. &#8216;Mmm, it&#8217;s either chocolate, or skin. Only one way to find out.&#8217;<BR>She popped it in her mouth.<BR>&#8216;God.&#8217; Clara winced. &#8216;And you wonder why you&#8217;re single.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;I don&#8217;t wonder.&#8217; Myrna smiled. &#8216;I don&#8217;t need a man to complete me.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Oh really? What about Raoul?&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Ah, Raoul,&#8217; said Myrna dreamily. &#8216;He was a sweet.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;He was a gummy bear,&#8217; agreed Clara.<BR>&#8216;He completed me,&#8217; said Myrna. &#8216;And then some.&#8217; She patted her middle, large and generous, like the woman herself.<BR>&#8216;Look at this.&#8217; A razor voice cut through conversation.<BR>Ruth Zardo stood in the center of the bistro holding aloft a chocolate rabbit as though it were a grenade. It was made of rich dark chocolate, its long ears perky and alert, its face so real Clara half expected it to twitch its delicate candy whiskers. In its paws it held a basket woven from white and milk chocolate, and in that basket sat a dozen candy eggs, beautifully decorated. It was lovely and Clara prayed Ruth wasn&#8217;t about to toss it at someone.<BR>&#8216;It&#8217;s a bunny rabbit,&#8217; snarled the elderly poet.<BR>&#8216;I eat them too,&#8217; said Gabri to Myrna. &#8216;It&#8217;s a habit. A rabbit habit.&#8217;<BR>Myrna laughed and immediately wished she hadn&#8217;t. Ruth turned her glare on her.<BR>&#8216;Ruth.&#8217; Clara stood up and approached cautiously, holding her husband Peter&#8217;s Scotch as enticement. &#8216;Let the bunny go.&#8217;<BR>It was a sentence she&#8217;d never said before.<BR>&#8216;It&#8217;s a rabbit,&#8217; Ruth repeated as though to slow children. &#8216;So what&#8217;s it doing with these?&#8217;<BR>She pointed to the eggs.<BR>&#8216;Since when do rabbits have eggs?&#8217; Ruth persisted, looking at the bewildered villagers. &#8216;Never thought of that, eh? Where did it get them? Presumably from chocolate chickens. The bunny must have stolen the eggs from candy chickens who&#8217;re searching for their babies. Frantic.&#8217;<BR>The funny thing was, as the old poet spoke Clara could actually imagine chocolate chickens running around desperate to find their eggs. Eggs stolen by the Easter bunny.<BR>With that Ruth dropped the chocolate bunny to the floor, shattering it.<BR>&#8216;Oh, God,&#8217; said Gabri, running to pick it up. &#8216;That was for Olivier.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Really?&#8217; said Olivier, forgetting he himself had bought it.<BR>&#8216;This is a strange holiday,&#8217; said Ruth ominously. &#8216;I&#8217;ve never liked it.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;And now it&#8217;s mutual,&#8217; said Gabri, holding the fractured rabbit as though an adored and wounded child. He&#8217;s so tender, thought Clara not for the first time. Gabri was so big, so overwhelming, it was easy to forget how sensitive he was. Until moments like these when he gently held a dying chocolate bunny.<BR>&#8216;How do we celebrate Easter?&#8217; the old poet demanded, yanking Peter&#8217;s Scotch from Clara and downing it. &#8216;We hunt eggs and eat hot cross buns.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Mais, we go to St Thomas&#8217;s too,&#8217; said Monsieur B&#233;liveau.<BR>&#8216;More people go to Sarah&#8217;s Boulangerie than ever show up at church,&#8217; snapped Ruth. &#8216;They buy pastry with an instrument of torture on it. I know you think I&#8217;m crazy, but maybe I&#8217;m the only sane one here.&#8217;<BR>And on that disconcerting note she limped to the door, then turned back.<BR>&#8216;Don&#8217;t put those chocolate eggs out for the children. Something bad will happen.&#8217;<BR>And like Jeremiah, the weeping prophet, she was right. Something bad did happen.<BR>Next morning the eggs had vanished. All that could be found were wrappers. At first the villagers suspected older children, or perhaps even Ruth, had sabotaged the event.<BR>&#8216;Look at this,&#8217; said Peter, holding up the shredded remains of a chocolate bunny box. &#8216;Teeth marks. And claws.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;So it was Ruth,&#8217; said Gabri, taking the box and examining it.<BR>&#8216;See here.&#8217; Clara raced after a candy wrapper blowing across the village green. &#8216;Look, it&#8217;s all ripped apart as well.&#8217;<BR>After spending the morning hunting Easter egg wrappers and cleaning up the mess, most villagers trudged back to Olivier&#8217;s to warm themselves by the fire.<BR>&#8216;Now, really,&#8217; said Ruth to Clara and Peter over lunch at the bistro. &#8216;Couldn&#8217;t you see that coming?&#8217;<BR>&#8216;I admit it seems obvious,&#8217; Peter laughed, cutting into his golden croque-monsieur, the melted Camembert barely holding the maple-smoked ham and flaky croissant together. Around him anxious parents buzzed, trying to bribe crying children.<BR>&#8216;Every wild animal within miles must have been in the village last night,&#8217; said Ruth, slowly swirling the ice cubes in her Scotch. &#8216;Eating Easter eggs. Foxes, raccoons, squirrels.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Bears,&#8217; said Myrna, joining their table. &#8216;Jesus, that&#8217;s pretty scary. All those starving bears, rising from their dens, ravenous after hibernating all winter.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Imagine their surprise to find chocolate eggs and bunnies,&#8217; said Clara, between mouthfuls of creamy seafood chowder with chunks of salmon and scallops and shrimp. She took a crusty baguette and twisted off a piece, spreading it with Olivier&#8217;s special sweet butter. &#8216;The bears must have wondered what miracle had happened while they slept.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Not everything that rises up is a miracle,&#8217; said Ruth, lifting her eyes from the amber liquid, her lunch, and looking out the mullioned windows. &#8216;Not everything that comes back to life is meant to. This is a strange time of year. Rain one day, snow the next. Nothing&#8217;s certain. It&#8217;s unpredictable.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;Every season&#8217;s unpredictable,&#8217; said Peter. &#8216;Hurricanes in fall, snowstorms in winter.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;But you&#8217;ve just proved my point,&#8217; said Ruth. &#8216;You can name the threat. We all know what to expect in other seasons. But not spring. The worst flooding happens in spring. Forest fires, killing frosts, snowstorms and mud slides. Nature&#8217;s in turmoil. Anything can happen.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;The most achingly beautiful days happen in spring too,&#8217; said Clara.<BR>&#8216;True, the miracle of rebirth. I hear whole religions are based on the concept. But some things are better off buried.&#8217; The old poet got up and downed her Scotch. &#8216;It&#8217;s not over yet. The bears will be back.&#8217;<BR>&#8216;I would be too,&#8217; said Myrna, &#8216;if I&#8217;d suddenly found a village made of chocolate.&#8217;<BR>Clara smiled, but her eyes were on Ruth, who for once didn&#8217;t radiate anger or annoyance. Instead Clara caught something far more disconcerting.<BR>Fear.&nbsp;Copyright &#169; 2007 Louise Penny. All rights reserved.<BR>

This is a strange time of year. Rain one day, snow the next. Nothing&#8217;s certain. It&#8217;s unpredictable.&#8217;<br>&#8216;Every season&#8217;s unpredictable,&#8217; said Peter. &#8216;Hurricanes in fall, snowstorms in winter.&#8217;<br>&#8216;But you&#8217;ve just proved my point,&#8217; said Ruth. &#8216;You can name the threat. We all know what to expect in other seasons. But not spring. The worst flooding happens in spring. Forest fires, killing frosts, snowstorms and mud slides. Nature&#8217;s in turmoil. Anything can happen.&#8217;<br>&#8216;The most achingly beautiful days happen in spring too,&#8217; said Clara.<br>&#8216;True, the miracle of rebirth. I hear whole religions are based on the concept. But some things are better off buried.&#8217; The old poet got up and downed her Scotch. &#8216;It&#8217;s not over yet. The bears will be back.&#8217;<br>&#8216;I would be too,&#8217; said Myrna, &#8216;if I&#8217;d suddenly found a village made of chocolate.&#8217;<br>Clara smiled, but her eyes were on Ruth, who for once didn&#8217;t radiate anger or annoyance. Instead Clara caught something far more disconcerting.<br>Fear.&nbsp;Copyright &#169; 2007 Louise Penny.
