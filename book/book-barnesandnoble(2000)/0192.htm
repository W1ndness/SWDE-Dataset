</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The mixture of slapstick and gunplay that has put Evanovich's  series about a sassy, less than competent New Jersey bounty  hunter at the top of bestseller lists once again works its magic  in Stephanie Plum's latest caper (after 2005's Eleven on Top).  Stephanie, who freely admits her failings as a hunter of  fugitives, faces a growing work backlog that threatens the  continued existence of her job. Her clumsy efforts to clear some  cases, along with the help of her outrageous colleague, Lula,  result only in their adding another sad sack to the office  payroll a forlorn shoe salesman who's talked off a ledge by  Stephanie's offer of a position as file clerk. Stephanie's  ambivalence toward the two men in her life becomes harder to  maintain when one of them, the mysterious Ranger, is accused of  kidnapping his own daughter. Countless over-the-top scenes,  including one at a funeral parlor, will delight longtime fans.  1.25 million first printing; author tour.

											I really liked this book.  I especially like the humor and the quick action.  The male interests are credible and fun.  The fact Stephanie eats bad food, except at her Mom's house, is fun and makes you feel like you're on vacation.  The book is great for escapism and making you laugh.  The family characters are easy to relate to and make you feel like your own family's dsyfunctional traits are similar to everyone else's.  What makes the series engaging is the offbeat or quirky dialogues between Stephanie and co-workers, as well as the fact that she is just an average person not particularly good at what she does.  She has determination and just keeps at it in order to make a living - like most of us!</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Sail/James-Patterson/e/9780446536103/?pv=y">Sail</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>One of the best Steph adventures!<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1286345_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780641870576_BK_1_1286345" href="#previewReview_1286345" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>January 17, 2010: 
											I absolutely loved Twelve Sharp! It was hilarious (as usual), and had an intense, intricate plot which kept me turning the pages. Being a big Stephanie Plum fan, I've been hoping to learn more about Ranger as the series continues, and I wasn't disappointed. I also appreciated the love-triangle dilemma, which was very funny when Morelli and Ranger decided to move in with Steph at the same time!

Come to think of it, Ms. Plum has more than a little in common with her creator Janet Evanovich.<p>    Much like the panty-pushing Plum, Evanovich once made her trade in erotica as a romance novelist for the trashy Bantam series "Loveswept." Tiring of the genre and finding herself increasingly fixated on crime, mystery, and the kind of adventures she came to love through comic books like <I>Uncle Scrooge</I>, she decided to ditch steamy stories in favor of off-the-wall humor and feats of daring. As Evanovich said on her website, "after twelve romance novels I ran out of sexual positions and decided to move into the mystery genre." <p>    The resulting Stephanie Plum Mysteries reflect Evanovich's love for comics, toys, shoe-shopping, Cheez Doodles, and beer. Evanovich also created a memorable character that shares many of the author's distinctive traits, such as her self-effacing, dirty-minded wit. The Plum Mysteries, while often rambling and thin on plot, are never anything less than entertaining, hilarious, and refreshing in every way.<p>    Stephanie Plum made her debut in 1994's <I>One For the Money</I>, in which she tracked down Joe Morelli, an ex-cop and murder suspect who'd also been guilty of taking Stephanie's virginity when she was 18. The novel's sly mix of sexiness and childlike playfulness made for a sort of young adult novel for adults.     <P>Since then, the red-hot bounty hunter and a crew of misfits that includes retired hooker Lula, aging bail-jumper Eddie Decooch, and Plum's own hipster granny have romped their way "through the numbers," establishing Evanovich as one of the best and most inventive writers of "Strong Woman" mysteries and guaranteeing her a place on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller list.    <P>In 2004, Evanovich introduced a smart, savvy new series featuring Alexander "Barney" Barnaby, a sexy Baltimore car mechanic, NASCAR nut, and amateur sleuth with her own posse of delightful eccentrics. She's not Plum, but she's definitely a peach. Hey, what else would you expect from a Janet Evanovich heroine? <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Evanovich's motorcycle-riding daughter Alex</b> has created an online comic about her hamster called "Batster," which her mother proudly displays on her web site. With episodes like "Batster vs. Beerzilla," it's clear that wackiness runs in the Evanovich genes.  <p>  <b>If you think the Stephanie Plum novels are zany, </b> wait till you hear about what Evanovich was writing before she started getting published. As she explains on her web site, "The first story [I ever wrote] was about the pornographic adventures of a fairy who lived in a second rate fairy forest in Pennsylvania."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2003, Evanovich took some time out to talk with us about her favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>  When I was a kid I read comics. My favorites were <I>Donald Duck</I> and <I>Uncle Scrooge</I>. Donald, Scrooge, Huey, Dewey, and Louie were a little dysfunctional, but they basically liked each other and they were always going on adventures -- just like Stephanie Plum. <p>     <b>What are your all-time favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li>All of the <I>Uncle Scrooge</I> stories by Don Rosa. <p>  <li><I>The Law is a Lady</I> by Nora Roberts, because it encouraged me to try writing romance. <p>  <li><I>The Rake</I> by Mary Jo Putney, because I love the hero to heroine dynamic. <p>  <li>All of Robert Parker's books, because they're so clean. <p>   <li>The <I>Black Stallion</I> series by Walter Farley, because they made my childhood bearable. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you? </b><br>  I like films that make me happy and raise my energy level. I love <I>Ghostbusters</I>, <I>French Kiss</I>, <I>Captain Ron</I>, <I>Troop Beverley Hills</I>, <I>Pretty Woman</I>, <I>Notting Hill</I>, <I>Miss Congeniality</I>, <I>Wallace & Gromit</I>, <I>My Man Godfrey</I>, all Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies, <I>You've Got Mail</I>, <I>Back to School</I>, <I>The Blues Brothers</I>. <p>     <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I need quiet to write. When I listen to music, I like happy music, like funk and disco. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading -- and why? </b><br>  Junie B. Jones books -- because they're fun, and I like the drawings. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I like nonfiction for gifts. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have a Winnie the Pooh clock, a statue of an angry Donald Duck, a Little Lulu bank, a stuffed Sully from <I>Monsters Inc.</I>, a Bartman action figure and my cat, Gus, on my desk when I write. <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I was unpublished for ten years and have three books that are still in my dresser drawer (and will stay there)! If you want something bad enough, you stick with it, eh? <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Don't give up, continue to grow, eat some Cheez Doodles and drink some beer.<p>    <b>What was your first job like?</b><br>   My first job was as a mail clerk for the DuPont chemical plant in South Amboy. I used to have to run across a catwalk grate over vats of formaldehyde to get from one side of the plant to the next.   I used to wear short skirts and the men tending the vats would stand under the grate and wait for my run! <p>    <b>How do you like to unwind?</b><br>  I don't unwind!  I just keep going. If I ever unwound I might not get wound again. I have no hobbies. I just work. I'm <I>really</I> boring. I like champagne and greasy pork roll sandwiches, and shopping for shoes. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>The Barnes & Noble Review</b><br>The 12th installment of Janet Evanovich's wildly popular mystery saga featuring the feisty and ever-endearing lingerie buyer turned bounty hunter Stephanie Plum pits the New Jersey bond enforcement agent against her most formidable foe yet: a completely deranged psycho obsessed with one of Plum's two longtime love interests. 
<p></p>
<i>Twelve Sharp</i> begins with Plum faced with the usual unsavory duties of a bounty hunter -- tracking down a bevy of criminals who have skipped out on their bail. Targets on her "skip" list include the aptly named Melvin Pickle, a self-proclaimed pervert who is eerily reminiscent of Pee-wee Herman; Mary Lee Truk, a menopausal housewife who stabbed her husband where the sun don't shine; and Caroline Scarzolli, a 72-year-old porn peddler. But Plum's hunt for wayward criminals is rudely interrupted by a crazed, gun-toting woman claiming to be the wife of Ricardo "Ranger" Manoso, the tall, dark, and handsome Cuban-American bounty hunter who, along with Trenton cop Joseph Morelli, make up Plum's love triangle -- one as steamy as it is dysfunctional. After Ranger's alleged wife turns up dead and his estranged daughter is kidnapped, Plum discovers that someone has stolen Ranger's identity and is slowly and systematically taking over his life. Next on the unhinged impostor's list is Ranger's hot girlfriend -- Plum herself.

In an interview, Evanovich talked about giving her fans exactly what they want: "I don't want to go beyond their comfort zone�. I'm their feel-good read." In <i>Twelve Sharp,</i> she delivers the goods in a big way. Riotously entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny, Evanovich's novel is, to steal a particularly perverse line from its pages, "hours of pleasure guaranteed." <i>Paul Goat Allen</i></p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>As bungling bounty hunter Stephanie Plum deals with the usual bail jumpers and struggles with chaotic relationships, a new twist emerges in the form of a mysterious female stalker.

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Trenton's most renowned bounty hunter (Eleven on Top, 2005, etc.) becomes the prey of a delusional stalker. Stephanie Plum, eternally unable to decide between the two men in her life, has long temporized by accepting the embraces of both. Joe Morelli, the high-school-heartthrob-turned-cop, has never been happy about this arrangement. But bounty hunter Ranger Manoso has eagerly accepted the challenge of muscling in on Morelli's turf. Now the delicate balance between wild and wilder romance is upset by the sudden appearance of one Carmen Manoso, who identifies herself as Ranger's wife and warns Stephanie off. Not to worry: She's soon found shot dead in her SUV outside the bond enforcement agency where Stephanie works. Meantime, however, there's been even more disturbing news: a report that Ranger has kidnapped his ten-year-old daughter from her mother and stepfather in Florida. Unlike Carmen's revelation, this story is neither true nor toothless. The kidnapper is a demented wannabe who wants Ranger's job, his kid and, of course, his woman. That would be Stephanie, who reacts with a predictable but highly entertaining blend of outrage, humor and proactive tactics of her own. Evanovich wisely soft-pedals the mystery, which has never been her strong suit, and finds exactly the right tone of danger-laden farce for Stephanie's duel with the false Ranger, spicing it with a million one-liners, aspiring bond enforcers and hapless criminals on the run.

I baked the cake, iced the cake, and served it up. It looked like a cake, but as soon as you cut into it and took a taste, you knew something else was going on. People are like that, too. Sometimes you just can&#8217;t tell what&#8217;s on the inside from looking at the outside. Sometimes people are a big surprise, just like the salt cake. Sometimes the surprise turns out to be good. And sometimes the surprise turns out to be bad. And sometimes the surprise is just friggin&#8217; confusing. <p>Joe Morelli is one of those good surprises. He&#8217;s two years older than I am, and for most of my school years, spending time with Morelli was like a visit to the dark side, alluring and frightening. He&#8217;s a Trenton cop now, and he&#8217;s my off-again, on-again boyfriend. He used to be the hair-raising part of my life, but my life has had a lot of changes, and now he&#8217;s the normal part. He has a dog named Bob, and a nice little house, and a toaster. On the outside Morelli is still street tough and dangerously alluring. On the inside Morelli is now the sexy guy with the toaster. Go figure. <p>I have a hamster named Rex, a utilitarian apartment, and my toaster is broken. My name is Stephanie Plum, and I work as a bond enforcement agent, also known as a bounty hunter, for my cousin Vinnie. It&#8217;s not a great job, but it has its moments, and if I mooch food off my parents the job almost pays enough to get me through the month. It would pay a lot more but the truth is, I&#8217;m not all that good at it. <p>Sometimes I moonlight for a guy named Ranger who&#8217;s extremely bad inan incredibly good way. He&#8217;s a security expert, and a bounty hunter, and he moves like smoke. Ranger is milk chocolate on the outside . . . a delicious, tempting, forbidden pleasure. And no one knows what&#8217;s on the inside. Ranger keeps his own counsel. <p>I work with two women I like a lot. Connie Rosolli is Vinnie&#8217;s office manager and junkyard dog. She&#8217;s a little older than I am. A little smarter. A little tougher. A little more Italian. She&#8217;s got a lot more chest, and she dresses like Betty Boop. <p>The other woman is my sometimes-partner Lula. Lula was at this moment parading around in the bail bonds office, showing Connie and me her new outfit. Lula is a way-beyond-voluptuous black woman who was currently squashed into four-inch spike heels and a sparkly gold spandex dress that had been constructed for a much smaller woman. The neckline was low, and the only thing keeping Lula&#8217;s big boobs from popping out was the fact that the material was snagged on her nipples. The skirt was stretched tight across her ass and hung two inches below the full moon. <p>With Connie and Lula you get what you see. <p>Lula bent to take a look at the heel on her shoe, and Connie was treated to a view of the night sky. <p>&#8220;Crikey,&#8221; Connie said. &#8220;You need to put some underwear on.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I got underwear on,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;I&#8217;m wearing my best thong. Just &#8217;cause I used to be a &#8217;ho don&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m cheap. Problem is that little thong stringy gets lost in all my derriere.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Tell me again what you&#8217;re doing in this getup,&#8221; Connie said. <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna be a rock-and-roll singer. I got a gig singing with Sally Sweet&#8217;s new band. You heard of the Who? Well, we&#8217;re gonna be the What.&#8221; <p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t sing,&#8221; Connie said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you sing. You can&#8217;t hold a tune to &#8216;Happy Birthday.&#8217; &#8221; <p>&#8220;The hell I can&#8217;t,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;I could sing your ass off. Besides, half those rock stars can&#8217;t sing. They just open their big oversize mouths and yell. And you gotta admit, I look good in this here dress. Nobody gonna be paying attention to my singing when I&#8217;m wearing this dress.&#8221; <p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got a point,&#8221; I said to Connie. <p>&#8220;No argument,&#8221; Connie said. <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m underrealized,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;I gotta lot of untapped potential. Yesterday my horoscope said I gotta expand my horizons.&#8221; <p>&#8220;You expand any more in that dress, and you&#8217;ll get yourself arrested,&#8221; Connie said. <p>The bonds office is on Hamilton Avenue, a couple blocks from Saint Francis Hospital. Handy for bonding out guys who&#8217;ve been shot. It&#8217;s a small storefront office sandwiched between a beauty parlor and a used bookstore. There&#8217;s an outer room with a scarred imitation leather couch, a couple folding chairs, Connie&#8217;s desk and computer, and a bank of files. Vinnie&#8217;s office is located in a room behind Connie&#8217;s desk. <p>When I started working for Vinnie he used his office to talk to his bookie and set up nooners with barnyard animals, but Vinnie has recently discovered the Internet, and now Vinnie uses his office to surf porn sites and online casinos. Behind the bank of file cabinets is a storeroom filled with the nuts and bolts of the bail bonds business. Confiscated televisions, DVD players, iPods, computers, a velvet painting of Elvis, a set of cookware, blenders, kids&#8217; bikes, engagement rings, a tricked-out Hog, a bunch of George Foreman grills, and God knows what else. Vinnie had some guns and ammo back there too. Plus a box of cuffs that he got on eBay. There&#8217;s a small bathroom that Connie keeps spotless and a back door in case there&#8217;s a need to sneak off. <p>&#8220;I hate to be a party pooper,&#8221; Connie said, &#8220;but we&#8217;re going to have to put the fashion show on hold because we have a problem.&#8221; She slid a stack of folders across her desk at me. &#8220;These are all unresolved skips. If we don&#8217;t find some of these guys we&#8217;re going belly-up.&#8221; <p>Here&#8217;s the way bail bonds works. If you&#8217;re accused of a crime and you don&#8217;t want to sit and rot in jail while you&#8217;re waiting for your trial to come up, you can give the court a wad of money. The court takes the money and lets you walk, and you get the money back when you show up on your trial date. If you don&#8217;t have that money stashed under your mattress, a bail bondsman can give the court the money on your behalf. He&#8217;ll charge you a percentage of the money, maybe ten percent, and he&#8217;ll keep that percentage whether you&#8217;re proven guilty or not. If the accused shows up for court, the court gives the bail bondsman his money back. If the accused doesn&#8217;t show up, the court keeps the money until the bondsman finds the accused and drags his sorry butt back to jail. <p>So you see the problem, right? Too much money going out and not enough money going in, and Vinnie might have to refinance his house. Or worse, the insurance company that backs Vinnie could yank the plug. <p>&#8220;Lula and I can&#8217;t keep up with the skips,&#8221; I said to Connie. &#8220;There are too many of them.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Yeah, and I&#8217;ll tell you the problem,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;It used to be Ranger worked full time for you, but anymore he&#8217;s got his own security business going, and he&#8217;s not doing skip tracing. It&#8217;s just Stephanie and me catching the bad guys these days.&#8221; <p>It was true. Ranger had moved most of his business toward the security side and only went into tracking mode when something came in that was over my head. There are some who might argue everything is over my head, but for practical purposes we&#8217;ve had to ignore that argument. <p>&#8220;I hate to say this,&#8221; I told Connie, &#8220;but you need to hire another bond enforcement person.&#8221; <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that easy,&#8221; Connie said. &#8220;Remember when we had Joyce Barnhardt working here? That was a disaster. She screwed up all her busts doing her big bad bounty hunter routine. And then she stole everyone&#8217;s skips. It&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s a team player.&#8221; <p>Joyce Barnhardt is my archenemy. I went all through school with her, and she was a misery. And before the ink was dry on my marriage license she was in bed with my husband, who is now my ex-husband. Thank you, Joyce. <p>&#8220;We could put a ad in the paper,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;That&#8217;s how I got my filing job here. Look at how good that turned out.&#8221; <p>Connie and I did eye rolls. <p>Lula was about the worst file clerk ever. Lula kept her job because no one else would tolerate Vinnie. The first time Vinnie made a grab at Lula she clocked him on the side of the head with a five-pound phone book and told him she&#8217;d staple his nuts to the wall if he didn&#8217;t show respect. And that was the end of sexual harassment in the bail bonds office. <p>Connie read the names off the files on her desk. &#8220;Lonnie Johnson, Kevin Gallager, Leon James, Dooby Biagi, Caroline Scarzolli, Melvin Pickle, Charles Chin, Bernard Brown, Mary Lee Truk, Luis Queen, John Santos. These are all current. You already have half of them. The rest came in last night. Plus we have nine outstanding that we&#8217;ve relegated to the temporarily lost cause file. Vinnie&#8217;s writing a lot of bond these days. Probably taking risks he shouldn&#8217;t. The result is more than the normal FTAs.&#8221; <p>When someone doesn&#8217;t show up for a court appearance we call them FTA. Failure to Appear. People fail to appear for a bunch of reasons. Hookers and pushers can make more money on the street than they can in jail so they only show up in court when you finally stop bonding them out. All other people just don&#8217;t want to go to jail. <p>Connie gave me the new files, and it was like an elephant was sitting on my chest. Lonnie Johnson was wanted for armed robbery. Leon James was suspected of arson and attempted murder. Kevin Gallager was wanted for grand theft auto. Mary Lee Truk had inserted a carving knife into her husband&#8217;s left buttock during a domestic disturbance. And Melvin Pickle was caught with his pants down in the third row of the multiplex. <p>Lula was looking over my shoulder, reading along with me. <p>&#8220;Melvin Pickle sounds like fun,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think we should start with Melvin.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Maybe a bond enforcement agent wanted ad in the paper isn&#8217;t such a bad idea,&#8221; I said to Connie. <p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Lula said, &#8220;just be careful how you word it. You probably want to fib a little. Like you don&#8217;t want to say we&#8217;re looking for some gun-happy lunatic to take down a bunch of scumbags.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep that in mind when I write it up,&#8221; Connie said. <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going down the street,&#8221; I told Lula. &#8220;I need something to make me happy. We&#8217;ll go to work when I get back.&#8221; <p>&#8220;You going to the drugstore?&#8221; Lula wanted to know. <p>&#8220;No. The bakery.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind if you brought me back one of them cream-filled doughnuts with the chocolate frosting,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;I need to get happy, too.&#8221; <p>At mid-morning the Garden State was heating up. Pavement was steaming under a cloudless sky, petrochemical plants were spewing to the north, and cars were emitting hydrocarbons statewide. By mid-afternoon I&#8217;d feel the toxic stew catch in the back of my throat, and I&#8217;d know it was truly summer in Jersey. For me, the stew is part of the Jersey experience. The stew has attitude. And it enhances the pull of Point Pleasant. How can you completely appreciate the Jersey shore if the air is safe to breathe in the interior parts of the state? <p>I swung into the bakery and went straight to <p>the doughnut case. Marjorie Lando was behind the counter, filling cannoli for a customer. Fine by me. I could wait my turn. The bakery was always a soothing experience. My heart rate slowed in the presence of massive quantities of sugar and lard. My mind floated over the acres of cookies and cakes and doughnuts and cream pies topped with rainbow sprinkles, chocolate frosting, whipped cream, and meringue. <p>I was patiently contemplating my doughnut selection when I sensed a familiar presence behind me. A hand brushed my hair back, and Ranger leaned in to me and kissed me on the nape of my neck. <p>&#8220;I could get you to look at me like that if I had five minutes alone with you,&#8221; Ranger said. <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you five minutes alone with me if you&#8217;ll take over half my skips.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Tempting,&#8221; Ranger said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m on my way to the airport, and I&#8217;m not sure when I&#8217;ll be back. Tank is in charge. Call him if you need help. And let him know if you decide to move into my apartment.&#8221; <p>Not that long ago I needed a safe place to stay, and sort of commandeered Ranger&#8217;s apartment when he was out of town. Ranger had come home and found me sleeping in his bed like Goldilocks. He&#8217;d very graciously not thrown me out the seventh-floor window. And in fact he&#8217;d allowed me to stay with a minimum of sexual harassment. Okay, maybe minimum isn&#8217;t entirely accurate. Maybe it was a seven on a scale of ten, but he hadn&#8217;t forced the issue. <p>&#8220;How did you know I was here?&#8221; I asked him. <p>&#8220;I stopped at the bonds office, and Lula told me you were on a doughnut mission.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; <p>&#8220;Miami.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Is this business or pleasure?&#8221; <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad business.&#8221; <p>Marjorie finished with her customer and made her way over to me. &#8220;What&#8217;ll it be?&#8221; she wanted to know. <p>&#8220;A dozen Boston Cream doughnuts.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Babe,&#8221; Ranger said. <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not all for me.&#8221; <p>Ranger doesn&#8217;t often smile. Mostly he thinks about smiling, and this was one of those thinking-smile times. He wrapped his hand around my wrist, pulled me to him, and kissed me. The kiss was warm and short. No tongue in front of the bakery lady, thank God. He turned and walked away. Tank was idling at the curb in a black SUV. Ranger got in and they drove off. <p>Marjorie was behind the counter with a cardboard box in her hand and her mouth dropped open. &#8220;Wow,&#8221; she said. <p>That dragged a sigh out of me because she was right. Ranger was definitely a wow. He stood half a head taller than me. He was perfectly toned muscle, and he had classic Latino good looks. He always smelled great. He dressed only in black. His skin was dark. His eyes were dark. His hair was dark. His life was dark. Ranger had lots of secrets. <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a work relationship,&#8221; I told Marjorie. <p>&#8220;If he was in here any longer, the chocolate would have melted off the eclairs.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like this,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;I wanted to go after the pervert. I personally think it&#8217;s a bad choice to go after the guy who likes guns.&#8221; <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the highest bond. The fastest way to dig Vinnie out of the hole is to get the guy with the highest bond.&#8221; <p>We were in Lula&#8217;s red Firebird, sitting across the street from Lonnie Johnson&#8217;s last known address. It was a small clapboard bungalow in a depressed neighborhood that backed up to the hockey arena. It was close to noon and not a great time to roust a bad guy. If he&#8217;s still in bed, it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s drunk and mean. If he&#8217;s not in bed, it&#8217;s most likely because he&#8217;s at a bar getting drunk and mean. <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the plan?&#8221; Lula wanted to know. &#8220;We gonna just bust in like gangsta bounty hunters and kick his ass?&#8221; <p>I looked at Lula. &#8220;Have we ever done that?&#8221; <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t.&#8221; <p>&#8220;We&#8217;d look like idiots. We&#8217;re incompetent.&#8221; <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s harsh,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re completely incompetent. I think we&#8217;re closer to eighty percent incompetent. Remember the time you wrestled that naked greased-up fat guy? You did a good job with that one.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Too early in the day to do the pizza delivery routine,&#8221; I said. <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do the flower delivery either. Nobody believe someone sending flowers to this dope.&#8221; <p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t changed clothes you could do the hooker delivery routine,&#8221; I said to Lula. &#8220;He would have opened the door to you in that gold thing.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Maybe we pretend we&#8217;re selling cookies. Like Girl Scouts. All we gotta do is go back to the 7-Eleven and get some cookies.&#8221; <p>I looked Johnson&#8217;s phone number up on the bond sheet and called him from my cell. <p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221; a man said. <p>&#8220;Lonnie Johnson?&#8221; <p>&#8220;What the fuck you want? Fuckin&#8217; bitch calling me at this hour. You think I got nothin&#8217; better to do than answer this phone?&#8221; And he hung up. <p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Lula asked. <p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t feel like talking. And he&#8217;s angry.&#8221; <p>A shiny black Hummer with tinted windows and bling wheel covers rolled down the street and stopped in front of Johnson&#8217;s house. <p>&#8220;Uh-oh,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;Company.&#8221; <p>The Hummer sat there for a moment and then opened fire on Johnson&#8217;s house. Multiple weapons. At least one was automatic, firing continuous rounds. Windows blew out and the house was drilled with shots. Gunfire was returned from the house, and I saw the nose of a rocket launcher poke out a front window. Obviously the Hummer saw it too because it laid rubber taking off. <p>&#8220;Maybe this isn&#8217;t a good time,&#8221; I said to Lula. <p>&#8220;I told you to go for the pervert.&#8221; <p>Melvin Pickle worked in a shoe store. The store was part of the mall that attached to the multiplex where he&#8217;d been caught shaking hands with the devil. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of enthusiasm for this capture, since I had some sympathetic feelings for Pickle. If I had to work in a shoe store all day I might go to the multiplex to whack off once in a while too. <p>&#8220;Not only is this going to be an easy catch,&#8221; Lula said, parking at the food court entrance, &#8220;but we can get pizza and go shopping.&#8221; <p>A half hour later, we were full of pizza and had taken a couple new perfumes out for a test drive. We&#8217;d moseyed down the mall and were standing in front of Pickle&#8217;s shoe store, scoping out the employees. I had a photo of Pickle that had come with his bond agreement. <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him,&#8221; Lula said, looking into the store. &#8220;That&#8217;s him on his knees, trying to sell that dumb woman those ugly-ass shoes.&#8221; <p>According to Pickle&#8217;s paperwork he&#8217;d just turned forty. He had sandy-colored hair that looked like it had been cut in boot camp. His skin was pale, his eyes hidden behind round-rimmed glasses, his mouth accented by a big herpes sore. He was five-foot-seven and had an average build gone soft. His slacks and dress shirt were just short of shabby. He didn&#8217;t look like he cared a whole lot if the woman bought the shoes. <p>I moved my cuffs from my shoulder bag to my jeans pocket. &#8220;I can manage this,&#8221; I said to Lula. &#8220;You stay here in case he bolts.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he looks like a bolter,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;I think he looks more like the walking dead.&#8221; <p>I agreed with Lula. Pickle looked like he was two steps away from putting a bullet in his brain. I moved behind him and waited for him to stand. <p>&#8220;I love this shoe,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;But I need a size nine.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a size nine,&#8221; Pickle said. <p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; <p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Maybe you should go back and look again.&#8221; <p>Pickle sucked air for a couple beats and nodded. &#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said. <p>He stood and turned and bumped into me. <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to leave, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; I said. &#8220;I bet you&#8217;re going to go out the back door and go home and never come back.&#8221; <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a recurring fantasy,&#8221; he said. <p>I glanced at my watch. It was twelve-thirty. &#8220;Have you had lunch?&#8221; I asked him. <p>&#8220;No.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Take your lunch now and come with me, and I&#8217;ll buy you a piece of pizza.&#8221; <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something wrong with this picture,&#8221; Pickle said. &#8220;Are you one of those religious nuts who wants to save me?&#8221; <p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m not a religious nut.&#8221; I held my hand out. &#8220;Stephanie Plum.&#8221; <p>He automatically shook my hand. &#8220;Melvin Pickle.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I work for Vincent Plum Bail Bonds,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You missed a court date, and you need to reschedule.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said. <p>&#8220;Now.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go now. I gotta work.&#8221; <p>&#8220;You can take your lunch break.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I had plans for lunch.&#8221; <p>Probably going to see a movie. I was still holding his hand, and with my other hand I clapped a bracelet on him. <p>He looked down at the cuff. &#8220;What&#8217;s this? You can&#8217;t do this. People will ask questions. And then what will I tell them? I&#8217;ll have to tell them I&#8217;m a pervert!&#8221; <p>Two women looked over at him and raised their eyebrows. <p>&#8220;No one will care,&#8221; I said. I turned to the women. &#8220;You don&#8217;t care, right?&#8221; <p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; they murmured and hurried out of the store. <p>&#8220;Just walk out into the mall quietly with me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to court and get you rebonded.&#8221; <p>Actually, Vinnie would rebond him. Vinnie and Connie could write bond. Lula and I did the capture thing. <p>&#8220;Darn,&#8221; Pickle said. &#8220;Darn it all.&#8221; <p>And he took off with the cuff dangling from his wrist. Lula stepped in front of him, but he had momentum and knocked her on her ass. He faltered for a moment, got his footing, and ran off into the mall. I was ten steps behind him. I stumbled over Lula, scrambled to my feet, and kept going. I chased him through the mall and up an escalator. <p>A hotel with an open atrium was attached to one end of the mall. Pickle ran into the hotel and barreled through the fire door into the stairwell. I chased him up five flights of stairs and thought my lungs were going to explode. He exited the stairwell, and I dragged myself, gasping, to the door. <p>There were seven floors in the hotel. All rooms opened to a hallway that overlooked the hotel atrium. We were on the sixth floor. I staggered out of the stairwell and saw that Pickle had made it halfway around the atrium and was straddling the balcony railing. <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come near me,&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;I&#8217;ll jump.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Fine with me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I get my money dead or alive.&#8221; <p>Pickle looked depressed at that fact. Or maybe Pickle just always looked depressed. <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in pretty good shape,&#8221; I said, still winded. &#8220;How do you stay in such good shape?&#8221; <p>&#8220;My car got repossessed. I walk everywhere. And all day long I&#8217;m up and down with the shoes. At the end of the day my knees are killing me.&#8221; <p>I was talking to him, creeping closer. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get a different job? One that&#8217;s easier on your knees.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Are you kidding me? I&#8217;m lucky to have this job. Look at me. I&#8217;m a loser. And now everybody&#8217;s going to know I&#8217;m a pervert. I&#8217;m a pervert loser. And I have a big herpes. I&#8217;m a pervert loser with a herpes!&#8221; <p>&#8220;You need to get a grip. You don&#8217;t have to be a pervert loser if you don&#8217;t want to be.&#8221; <p>He sat on the railing and swung both legs over. &#8220;Easy for you to say. You aren&#8217;t named Melvin Pickle. And I bet you were a baton twirler in high school. You probably had friends. You probably date.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly date, but I sort of have a boyfriend.&#8221; <p>&#8220;What does sort of mean?&#8221; <p>&#8220;It means that he looks like my boyfriend, but I don&#8217;t say it out loud.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Pickle wanted to know. <p>&#8220;It feels weird. I&#8217;m not sure why.&#8221; Okay, I knew why, but I wasn&#8217;t going to say that out loud either. I had feelings for two men, and I didn&#8217;t know how to choose between them. &#8220;And I wish you wouldn&#8217;t sit like that. It&#8217;s creeping me out.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Are you afraid I&#8217;ll fall? I thought you didn&#8217;t care. Remember dead or alive?&#8221; <p>My cell phone was ringing in my bag. <p>&#8220;For crying out loud, answer it,&#8221; Pickle said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me, I&#8217;m only going to kill myself.&#8221; <p>I did an exaggerated eye roll and answered the phone. <p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;Where are you? I been looking all over.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in the hotel at the end of the mall.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m right outside of that hotel. What are you doing there? Do you have Pickle?&#8221; <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly have Pickle. We&#8217;re on the sixth floor, and he&#8217;s thinking about jumping off the balcony.&#8221; <p>I looked over the railing and saw Lula walk into the atrium. She looked up, and I waved at her. <p>&#8220;I see you,&#8221; Lula said. &#8220;Tell Pickle he&#8217;s gonna make a big mess if he jumps. This floor&#8217;s marble, and his head&#8217;s gonna crack open like a fresh egg, and there&#8217;s gonna be brains and blood all over the place.&#8221; <p>I disconnected and relayed the message to Pickle. <p>&#8220;I have a plan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to jump feet first. That way my head won&#8217;t make such an impact when I land.&#8221; <p>Pickle was getting noticed. People were dotted around the atrium, looking up at him. The elevator opened behind me and a man in a suit stepped out. <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; he wanted to know. <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come near me!&#8221; Pickle yelled. &#8220;If you come near me, I&#8217;ll jump.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the hotel manager,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;Is there something I can do?&#8221; <p>&#8220;Do you have a giant net?&#8221; I asked him. <p>&#8220;Just go away,&#8221; Pickle said. &#8220;I have big problems. I&#8217;m a pervert.&#8221; <p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like a pervert,&#8221; the manager said. <p>&#8220;I whacked off in the multiplex,&#8221; Pickle told him. <p>&#8220;Everybody whacks off in the multiplex,&#8221; the manager said. &#8220;I like to go when there&#8217;s one of those chick flicks playing, and I wear my wife&#8217;s panties and I&#8212;&#8221; <p>&#8220;Jeez,&#8221; Pickle said. &#8220;Too much information.&#8221; <p>The manager disappeared behind the elevator doors and minutes later reappeared in the lobby. He stood in a small cluster of hotel employees, everyone with their heads back, their eyes glued to Pickle. <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making a scene,&#8221; I said to Pickle. <p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Pickle said. &#8220;Pretty soon they&#8217;re going to start yelling &#8216;Jump.&#8217; The human race is lacking. Have you noticed?&#8221; <p>&#8220;There are some good people,&#8221; I told him. <p>&#8220;Oh yeah? Who&#8217;s the best person you know? Of all the people you know personally, is there anyone who has a sense of right and wrong and lives by it?&#8221; <p>This was a sticky question because it would have to be Ranger . . . but I suspected he occasionally killed people. Only bad people, of course, but still . . . <p>The crowd in the atrium was growing and now included some uniformed security guys and two Trenton cops. One of the cops was on his two-way, probably calling Morelli to tell him I was involved in yet another disaster. A cameraman and his assistant joined the crowd. <p>Copyright &#169; 2006 by Evanovich, Inc. All rights reserved. <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p>

I baked the cake, iced the cake, and served it up. It looked like a cake, but as soon as you cut into it and took a taste, you knew something else was going on. People are like that, too. Sometimes you just can't tell what's on the inside from looking at the outside. Sometimes people are a big surprise, just like the salt cake. Sometimes the surprise turns out to be good. And sometimes the surprise turns out to be bad. And sometimes the surprise is just friggin' confusing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Joe Morelli is one of those good surprises. He's two years older than I am, and for most of my school years, spending time with Morelli was like a visit to the dark side, alluring and frightening. He's a Trenton cop now, and he's my off-again, on-again boyfriend. He used to be the hair-raising part of my life, but my life has had a lot of changes, and now he's the normal part. He has a dog named Bob, and a nice little house, and a toaster. On the outside Morelli is still street tough and dangerously alluring. On the inside Morelli is now the sexy guy with the toaster. Go figure.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have a hamster named Rex, a utilitarian apartment, and my toaster is broken. My name is Stephanie Plum, and I work as a bond enforcement agent, also known as a bountyhunter, for my cousin Vinnie. It's not a great job, but it has its moments, and if I mooch food off my parents the job almost pays enough to get me through the month. It would pay a lot more but the truth is, I'm not all that good at it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes I moonlight for a guy named Ranger who's extremely bad in an incredibly good way. He's a security expert, and a bounty hunter, and he moves like smoke. Ranger is milk chocolate on the outside . . . a delicious, tempting, forbidden pleasure. And no one knows what's on the inside. Ranger keeps his own counsel.<br>&nbsp;<br>I work with two women I like a lot. Connie Rosolli is Vinnie's office manager and junkyard dog. She's a little older than I am. A little smarter. A little tougher. A little more Italian. She's got a lot more chest, and she dresses like Betty Boop.<br>&nbsp;<br>The other woman is my sometimes-partner Lula. Lula was at this moment parading around in the bail bonds office, showing Connie and me her new outfit. Lula is a way-beyond-voluptuous black woman who was currently squashed into four-inch spike heels and a sparkly gold spandex dress that had been constructed for a much smaller woman. The neckline was low, and the only thing keeping Lula's big boobs from popping out was the fact that the material was snagged on her nipples. The skirt was stretched tight across her ass and hung two inches below the full moon.<br>&nbsp;<br>With Connie and Lula you get what you see.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lula bent to take a look at the heel on her shoe, and Connie was treated to a view of the night sky.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Crikey," Connie said. "You need to put some underwear on."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I got underwear on," Lula said. "I'm wearing my best thong. Just 'cause I used to be a 'ho don't mean I'm cheap. Problem is that little thong stringy gets lost in all my derriere."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Tell me again what you're doing in this getup," Connie said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm gonna be a rock-and-roll singer. I got a gig singing with Sally Sweet's new band. You heard of the Who? Well, we're gonna be the What."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You can't sing," Connie said. "I've heard you sing. You can't hold a tune to 'Happy Birthday.' "<br>&nbsp;<br>"The hell I can't," Lula said. "I could sing your ass off. Besides, half those rock stars can't sing. They just open their big oversize mouths and yell. And you gotta admit, I look good in this here dress. Nobody gonna be paying attention to my singing when I'm wearing this dress."<br>&nbsp;<br>"She's got a point," I said to Connie.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No argument," Connie said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm underrealized," Lula said. "I gotta lot of untapped potential. Yesterday my horoscope said I gotta expand my horizons."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You expand any more in that dress, and you'll get yourself arrested," Connie said.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bonds office is on Hamilton Avenue, a couple blocks from Saint Frances Hospital. Handy for bonding out guys who've been shot. It's a small storefront office sandwiched between a beauty parlor and a used bookstore. There's an outer room with a scarred imitation leather couch, a couple folding chairs, Connie's desk and computer, and a bank of files. Vinnie's office is located in a room behind Connie's desk.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I started working for Vinnie he used his office to talk to his bookie and set up nooners with barnyard animals, but Vinnie has recently discovered the Internet, and now Vinnie uses his office to surf porn sites and online casinos. Behind the bank of file cabinets is a storeroom filled with the nuts and bolts of the bail bonds business. Confiscated televisions, DVD players, iPods, computers, a velvet painting of Elvis, a set of cookware, blenders, kids' bikes, engagement rings, a tricked-out Hog, a bunch of George Foreman grills, and God knows what else. Vinnie had some guns and ammo back there too. Plus a box of cuffs that he got on eBay. There's a small bathroom that Connie keeps spotless and a back door in case there's a need to sneak off.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I hate to be a party pooper," Connie said, "but we're going to have to put the fashion show on hold because we have a problem." She slid a stack of folders across her desk at me. "These are all unresolved skips. If we don't find some of these guys we're going belly-up."<br>&nbsp;<br>Here's the way bail bonds works. If you're accused of a crime and you don't want to sit and rot in jail while you're waiting for your trial to come up, you can give the court a wad of money. The court takes the money and lets you walk, and you get the money back when you show up on your trial date. If you don't have that money stashed under your mattress, a bail bondsman can give the court the money on your behalf. He'll charge you a percentage of the money, maybe ten percent, and he'll keep that percentage whether you're proven guilty or not. If the accused shows up for court, the court gives the bail bondsman his money back. If the accused doesn't show up, the court keeps the money until the bondsman finds the accused and drags his sorry butt back to jail.<br>&nbsp;<br>So you see the problem, right? Too much money going out and not enough money going in, and Vinnie might have to refinance his house. Or worse, the insurance company that backs Vinnie could yank the plug.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Lula and I can't keep up with the skips," I said to Connie. "There are too many of them."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah, and I'll tell you the problem," Lula said. "It used to be Ranger worked full time for you, but anymore he's got his own security business going, and he's not doing skip tracing. It's just Stephanie and me catching the bad guys these days."<br>&nbsp;<br>It was true. Ranger had moved most of his business toward the security side and only went into tracking mode when something came in that was over my head. There are some who might argue everything is over my head, but for practical purposes we've had to ignore that argument.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I hate to say this," I told Connie, "but you need to hire another bond enforcement person."<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's not that easy," Connie said. "Remember when we had Joyce Barnhardt working here? That was a disaster. She screwed up all her busts doing her big bad bounty hunter routine. And then she stole everyone's skips. It's not like she's a team player."<br>&nbsp;<br>Joyce Barnhardt is my archenemy. I went all through school with her, and she was a misery. And before the ink was dry on my marriage license she was in bed with my husband, who is now my ex-husband. Thank you, Joyce.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We could put a ad in the paper," Lula said. "That's how I got my filing job here. Look at how good that turned out."<br>&nbsp;<br>Connie and I did eye rolls.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lula was about the worst file clerk ever. Lula kept her job because no one else would tolerate Vinnie. The first time Vinnie made a grab at Lula she clocked him on the side of the head with a five-pound phone book and told him she'd staple his nuts to the wall if he didn't show respect. And that was the end of sexual harassment in the bail bonds office.<br>&nbsp;<br>Connie read the names off the files on her desk. "Lonnie Johnson, Kevin Gallager, Leon James, Dooby Biagi, Caroline Scarzolli, Melvin Pickle, Charles Chin, Bernard Brown, Mary Lee Truk, Luis Queen, John Santos. These are all current. You already have half of them. The rest came in last night. Plus we have nine outstanding that we've relegated to the temporarily lost cause file. Vinnie's writing a lot of bond these days. Probably taking risks he shouldn't. The result is more than the normal FTAs."<br>&nbsp;<br>When someone doesn't show up for a court appearance we call them FTA. Failure to Appear. People fail to appear for a bunch of reasons. Hookers and pushers can make more money on the street than they can in jail so they only show up in court when you finally stop bonding them out. All other people just don't want to go to jail.<br>&nbsp;<br>Connie gave me the new files, and it was like an elephant was sitting on my chest. Lonnie Johnson was wanted for armed robbery. Leon James was suspected of arson and attempted murder. Kevin Gallager was wanted for grand theft auto. Mary Lee Truk had inserted a carving knife into her husband's left buttock during a domestic disturbance. And Melvin Pickle was caught with his pants down in the third row of the multiplex.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lula was looking over my shoulder, reading along with me.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Melvin Pickle sounds like fun," she said. "I think we should start with Melvin."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Maybe a bond enforcement agent wanted ad in the paper isn't such a bad idea," I said to Connie.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah," Lula said, "just be careful how you word it. You probably want to fib a little. Like you don't want to say we're looking for some gun-happy lunatic to take down a bunch of scumbags."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'll keep that in mind when I write it up," Connie said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm going down the street," I told Lula. "I need something to make me happy. We'll go to work when I get back."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You going to the drugstore?" Lula wanted to know.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No. The bakery."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I wouldn't mind if you brought me back one of them cream-filled doughnuts with the chocolate frosting," Lula said. "I need to get happy, too."<br>&nbsp;<br>At mid-morning the Garden State was heating up. Pavement was steaming under a cloudless sky, petrochemical plants were spewing to the north, and cars were emitting hydrocarbons statewide. By mid-afternoon I'd feel the toxic stew catch in the back of my throat, and I'd know it was truly summer in Jersey. For me, the stew is part of the Jersey experience. The stew has attitude. And it enhances the pull of Point Pleasant. How can you completely appreciate the Jersey shore if the air is safe to breathe in the interior parts of the state?<br>&nbsp;<br>I swung into the bakery and went straight to the doughnut case. Marjorie Lando was behind the counter, filling cannoli for a customer. Fine by me. I could wait my turn. The bakery was always a soothing experience. My heart rate slowed in the presence of massive quantities of sugar and lard. My mind floated over the acres of cookies and cakes and doughnuts and cream pies topped with rainbow sprinkles, chocolate frosting, whipped cream, and meringue.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was patiently contemplating my doughnut selection when I sensed a familiar presence behind me. A hand brushed my hair back, and Ranger leaned in to me and kissed me on the nape of my neck.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I could get you to look at me like that if I had five minutes alone with you," Ranger said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'll give you five minutes alone with me if you'll take over half my skips."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Tempting," Ranger said, "but I'm on my way to the airport, and I'm not sure when I'll be back. Tank is in charge. Call him if you need help. And let him know if you decide to move into my apartment."<br>&nbsp;<br>Not that long ago I needed a safe place to stay, and sort of commandeered Ranger's apartment when he was out of town. Ranger had come home and found me sleeping in his bed like Goldilocks. He'd very graciously not thrown me out the seventh-floor window. And in fact he'd allowed me to stay with a minimum of sexual harassment. Okay, maybe minimum isn't entirely accurate. Maybe it was a seven on a scale of ten, but he hadn't forced the issue.<br>&nbsp;<br>"How did you know I was here?" I asked him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I stopped at the bonds office, and Lula told me you were on a doughnut mission."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Where are you going?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Miami."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Is this business or pleasure?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's bad business."<br>&nbsp;<br>Marjorie finished with her customer and made her way over to me. "What'll it be?" she wanted to know.<br>&nbsp;<br>"A dozen Boston Cream doughnuts."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Babe," Ranger said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"They're not all for me."<br>&nbsp;<br>Ranger doesn't often smile. Mostly he thinks about smiling, and this was one of those thinking-smile times. He wrapped his hand around my wrist, pulled me to him, and kissed me. The kiss was warm and short. No tongue in front of the bakery lady, thank God. He turned and walked away. Tank was idling at the curb in a black SUV. Ranger got in and they drove off.<br>&nbsp;<br>Marjorie was behind the counter with a cardboard box in her hand and her mouth dropped open. "Wow," she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>That dragged a sigh out of me because she was right. Ranger was definitely a wow. He stood half a head taller than me. He was perfectly toned muscle, and he had classic Latino good looks. He always smelled great. He dressed only in black. His skin was dark. His eyes were dark. His hair was dark. His life was dark. Ranger had lots of secrets.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's a work relationship," I told Marjorie.<br>&nbsp;<br>"If he was in here any longer, the chocolate would have melted off the eclairs."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't like this," Lula said. "I wanted to go after the pervert. I personally think it's a bad choice to go after the guy who likes guns."<br>&nbsp;<br>"He's got the highest bond. The fastest way to dig Vinnie out of the hole is to get the guy with the highest bond."<br>&nbsp;<br>We were in Lula's red Firebird, sitting across the street from Lonnie Johnson's last known address. It was a small clapboard bungalow in a depressed neighborhood that backed up to the hockey arena. It was close to noon and not a great time to roust a bad guy. If he's still in bed, it's because he's drunk and mean. If he's not in bed, it's most likely because he's at a bar getting drunk and mean.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What's the plan?" Lula wanted to know. "We gonna just bust in like gangsta bounty hunters and kick his ass?"<br>&nbsp;<br>I looked at Lula. "Have we ever done that?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Don't mean we can't."<br>&nbsp;<br>"We'd look like idiots. We're incompetent."<br>&nbsp;<br>"That's harsh," Lula said. "And I don't think we're completely incompetent. I think we're closer to eighty percent incompetent. Remember the time you wrestled that naked greased-up fat guy? You did a good job with that one."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Too early in the day to do the pizza delivery routine," I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Can't do the flower delivery either. Nobody believe someone sending flowers to this dope."<br>&nbsp;<br>"If you hadn't changed clothes you could do the hooker delivery routine," I said to Lula. "He would have opened the door to you in that gold thing."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Maybe we pretend we're selling cookies. Like Girl Scouts. All we gotta do is go back to the 7-Eleven and get some cookies."<br>&nbsp;<br>I looked Johnson's phone number up on the bond sheet and called him from my cell.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah?" a man said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Lonnie Johnson?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"What the fuck you want? Fuckin' bitch calling me at this hour. You think I got nothin' better to do than answer this phone?" And he hung up.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well?" Lula asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>"He didn't feel like talking. And he's angry."<br>&nbsp;<br>A shiny black Hummer with tinted windows and bling wheel covers rolled down the street and stopped in front of Johnson's house.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Uh-oh," Lula said. "Company."<br>&nbsp;<br>The Hummer sat there for a moment and then opened fire on Johnson's house. Multiple weapons. At least one was automatic, firing continuous rounds. Windows blew out and the house was drilled with shots. Gunfire was returned from the house, and I saw the nose of a rocket launcher poke out a front window. Obviously the Hummer saw it too because it laid rubber taking off.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Maybe this isn't a good time," I said to Lula.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I told you to go for the pervert."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Melvin Pickle worked in a shoe store. The store was part of the mall that attached to the multiplex where he'd been caught shaking hands with the devil. I didn't have a lot of enthusiasm for this capture, since I had some sympathetic feelings for Pickle. If I had to work in a shoe store all day I might go to the multiplex to whack off once in a while too.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Not only is this going to be an easy catch," Lula said, parking at the food court entrance, "but we can get pizza and go shopping."<br>&nbsp;<br>A half hour later, we were full of pizza and had taken a couple new perfumes out for a test drive. We'd moseyed down the mall and were standing in front of Pickle's shoe store, scoping out the employees. I had a photo of Pickle that had come with his bond agreement.<br>&nbsp;<br>"That's him," Lula said, looking into the store. "That's him on his knees, trying to sell that dumb woman those ugly-ass shoes."<br>&nbsp;<br>According to Pickle's paperwork he'd just turned forty. He had sandy-colored hair that looked like it had been cut in boot camp. His skin was pale, his eyes hidden behind round-rimmed glasses, his mouth accented by a big herpes sore. He was five-foot-seven and had an average build gone soft. His slacks and dress shirt were just short of shabby. He didn't look like he cared a whole lot if the woman bought the shoes.<br>&nbsp;<br>I moved my cuffs from my shoulder bag to my jeans pocket. "I can manage this," I said to Lula. "You stay here in case he bolts."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't think he looks like a bolter," Lula said. "I think he looks more like the walking dead."<br>&nbsp;<br>I agreed with Lula. Pickle looked like he was two steps away from putting a bullet in his brain. I moved behind him and waited for him to stand.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I love this shoe," the woman said. "But I need a size nine."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't have a size nine," Pickle said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Are you sure?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Maybe you should go back and look again."<br>&nbsp;<br>Pickle sucked air for a couple beats and nodded. "Sure," he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>He stood and turned and bumped into me.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're going to leave, aren't you?" I said. "I bet you're going to go out the back door and go home and never come back."<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's a recurring fantasy," he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>I glanced at my watch. It was twelve-thirty. "Have you had lunch?" I asked him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Take your lunch now and come with me, and I'll buy you a piece of pizza."<br>&nbsp;<br>"There's something wrong with this picture," Pickle said. "Are you one of those religious nuts who wants to save me?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"No. I'm not a religious nut." I held my hand out. "Stephanie Plum."<br>&nbsp;<br>He automatically shook my hand. "Melvin Pickle."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I work for Vincent Plum Bail Bonds," I said. "You missed a court date, and you need to reschedule."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sure," he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Now."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I can't go now. I gotta work."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You can take your lunch break."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I had plans for lunch."<br>&nbsp;<br>Probably going to see a movie. I was still holding his hand, and with my other hand I clapped a bracelet on him.<br>&nbsp;<br>He looked down at the cuff. "What's this? You can't do this. People will ask questions. And then what will I tell them? I'll have to tell them I'm a pervert!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Two women looked over at him and raised their eyebrows.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No one will care," I said. I turned to the women. "You don't care, right?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Right," they murmured and hurried out of the store.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Just walk out into the mall quietly with me," I said. "I'll take you to court and get yopture thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Darn," Pickle said. "Darn it all."<br>&nbsp;<br>And he took off with the cuff dangling from his wrist. Lula stepped in front of him, but he had momentum and knocked her on her ass. He faltered for a moment, got his footing, and ran off into the mall. I was ten steps behind him. I stumbled over Lula, scrambled to my feet, and kept going. I chased him through the mall and up an escalator.<br>&nbsp;<br>A hotel with an open atrium was attached to one end of the mall. Pickle ran into the hotel and barreled through the fire door into the stairwell. I chased him up five flights of stairs and thought my lungs were going to explode. He exited the stairwell, and I dragged myself, gasping, to the door.<br>&nbsp;<br>There were seven floors in the hotel. All rooms opened to a hallway that overlooked the hotel atrium. We were on the sixth floor. I staggered out of the stairwell and saw that Pickle had made it halfway around the atrium and was straddling the balcony railing.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Don't come near me," he yelled. "I'll jump."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Fine with me," I said. "I get my money dead or alive."<br>&nbsp;<br>Pickle looked depressed at that fact. Or maybe Pickle just always looked depressed.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're in pretty good shape," I said, still winded. "How do you stay in such good shape?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"My car got repossessed. I walk everywhere. And all day long I'm up and down with the shoes. At the end of the day my knees are killing me."<br>&nbsp;<br>I was talking to him, creeping closer. "Why don't you get a different job? One that's easier on your knees."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Are you kidding me? I'm lucky to have this job. Look at me. I'm a loser. And now everybody's going to know I'm a pervert. I'm a pervert loser. And I have a big herpes. I'm a pervert loser with a herpes!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"You need to get a grip. You don't have to be a pervert loser if you don't want to be."<br>&nbsp;<br>He sat on the railing and swung both legs over. "Easy for you to say. You aren't named Melvin Pickle. And I bet you were a baton twirler in high school. You probably had friends. You probably date."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't exactly date, but I sort of have a boyfriend."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What does sort of mean?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"It means that he looks like my boyfriend, but I don't say it out loud."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why not?" Pickle wanted to know.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It feels weird. I'm not sure why." Okay, I knew why, but I wasn't going to say that out loud either. I had feelings for two men, and I didn't know how to chose between them. "And I wish you wouldn't sit like that. It's creeping me out."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Are you afraid I'll fall? I thought you didn't care. Remember dead or alive?"<br>&nbsp;<br>My cell phone was ringing in my bag.<br>&nbsp;<br>"For crying out loud, answer it," Pickle said. "Don't worry about me, I'm only going to kill myself."<br>&nbsp;<br>I did an exaggerated eye roll and answered the phone.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Hey," Lula said. "Where are you? I been looking all over."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm in the hotel at the end of the mall."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm right outside of that hotel. What are you doing there? Do you have Pickle?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't exactly have Pickle. We're on the sixth floor, and he's thinking about jumping off the balcony."<br>&nbsp;<br>I looked over the railing and saw Lula walk into the atrium. She looked up, and I waved at her.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I see you," Lula said. "Tell Pickle he's gonna make a big mess if he jumps. This floor's marble, and his head's gonna crack open like a fresh egg, and there's gonna be brains and blood all over the place."<br>&nbsp;<br>I disconnected and relayed the message to Pickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I have a plan," he said. "I'm going to jump feet first. That way my head won't make such an impact when I land."<br>&nbsp;<br>Pickle was getting noticed. People were dotted around the atrium, looking up at him. The elevator opened behind me and a man in a suit stepped out.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What's going on here?" he wanted to know.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Don't come near me!" Pickle yelled. "If you come near me, I'll jump."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm the hotel manager," the man said. "Is there something I can do?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Do you have a giant net?" I asked him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Just go away," Pickle said. "I have big problems. I'm a pervert."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You don't look like a pervert," the manager said.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I whacked off in the multiplex," Pickle told him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Everybody whacks off in the multiplex," the manager said. "I like to go when there's one of those chick flicks playing, and I wear my wife's panties and I--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Jeez," Pickle said. "Too much information."<br>&nbsp;<br>The manager disappeared behind the elevator doors and minutes later reappeared in the lobby. He stood in a small cluster of hotel employees, everyone with their heads back, their eyes glued to Pickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're making a scene," I said to Pickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah," Pickle said. "Pretty soon they're going to start yelling 'jump.' The human race is lacking. Have you noticed?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"There are some good people," I told him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh yeah? Who's the best person you know? Of all the people you know personally, is there anyone who has a sense of right and wrong and lives by it?"<br>&nbsp;<br>This was a sticky question because it would have to be Ranger . . . but I suspected he occasionally killed people. Only bad people, of course, but still . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>The crowd in the atrium was growing and now included some uniformed security guys and two Trenton cops. One of the cops was on his two-way, probably calling Morelli to tell him I was involved in yet another disaster. A cameraman and his assistant joined the crowd.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We're on television," I told Pickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pickle looked down, waved at the camera, and everyone cheered.<br>&nbsp;<br>"This is getting too weird," I told Pickle. "I'm leaving."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You can't leave. If you leave, I'll jump."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't care, remember?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Of course you care. You'll be responsible for my death."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh no. No, no, no." I wagged my finger at him. "That won't work with me. I grew up in the Burg. I was raised Catholic. I know guilt in and out. The first thirty years of my life were ruled by guilt. Not that guilt is an entirely bad thing. But you're not going to lay it on me. Whether you live or die is your choice. I have nothing to do with it. I'm not taking responsibility for the state of the pot roast anymore."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Pot roast?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Every Friday I'm expected for dinner at my parents' house. Every Friday my mom makes pot roast. If I'm late, the pot roast cooks too long and gets dry, and it's all my fault."<br>&nbsp;<br>"And?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"And it's not my fault!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Of course ith it meant ruining the pot roast. Boy, you should learn some manners."<br>&nbsp;<br>My cell phone rang again. It was my Grandma Mazur. She lives with my mom and dad. She moved in when Grandpa Mazur sailed off in a heaven-bound gravy boat.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're on television," she said. "I was trying to find Judge Judy, and you popped up. They said you were breaking news. Are you trying to rescue that guy on the railing, or are you trying to get him to jump?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"In the beginning I was trying to rescue him," I said. "But I'm starting to change my mind."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I gotta go now," Grandma said. "I gotta call Ruth Biablocki and tell her you're on television. She's always going on about her granddaughter and how she's got that good job at the bank. Well let's see her top this one. Her grandaughter don't get on television!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"What are you so depressed about that you want to jump off this balcony?" I asked Pickle. "Jumping to your death is pretty severe."<br>&nbsp;<br>"My life sucks! My wife left me and took everything, including my clothes and my dog. I got fired from my job and had to go to work in a shoe store. I have no money, so I had to move back home and live with my mother. And I got caught whacking off in a multiplex. Could it possibly get any worse?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"You have your health."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I think I'm getting a cold. I have a huge oozing cold sore!"<br>&nbsp;<br>My phone rang again.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Cupcake," Morelli said, "I don't like finding you in a hotel with another guy."<br>&nbsp;<br>I looked down and saw Morelli standing next to Lula.<br>&nbsp;<br>"He's a jumper," I told Morelli.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah," Morelli said. "I can see that. What's the story?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"He got caught whacking off in the multiplex and doesn't want to go to jail."<br>&nbsp;<br>"He won't get a lot of jail time for that," Morelli said. "Maybe a couple weekends or community service. It's not a big deal. Everyone whacks off in the multiplex."<br>&nbsp;<br>I relayed the message to Pickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's not just jail," Pickle said. "It's me. I'm a loser."<br>&nbsp;<br>Morelli was still on the phone. "Now what?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"He's a loser."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're on your own with that one," Morelli said. "Are you going to need help with this?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Maybe you need . . . vitamins," I said to Pickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pickle looked at me. Hopeful. "Do you think that could be it?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah. If you get off the railing we could go to the health food store and get some."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're just saying that to get me off the railing."<br>&nbsp;<br>"True. When you get off the railing, the police will probably arrest you for being a nut. You'll have to go to the station and wait for Vinnie to get there to bond you out again."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I can't afford to get bonded out again. I just walked off my job. I'm probably unemployed."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh for the love of everything holy." I peeked at my watch. I didn't have time for this. I had other fish to fry. "How about this. We need someone to do filing at the bonds office. Maybe I can get Vinnie to hire you so you can work off the fee to get bonded out."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Really? You'd do that for me?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Morelli was still listening in. "Okay, so far we've promised him community service, vitamins, and a job. The only thing left that he could possibly want is gorilla sex. And if you promise that to him I'm not going to be happy."<br>&nbsp;<br>I disconnected Morelli and put the phone back into my pocket.<br>&nbsp;<br>"About the job," Pickle said. "Vinnie wouldn't mind that I'm a . . . you know, pervert?"<br>&nbsp;<br>That was pretty funny. Vinnie minding that Pickle whacked off at the multiplex. "It's probably the only thing you have going for you," I told Pickle.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Okay," he said. "But you're going to have to help me get off this railing. I'm terrified to move."<br>&nbsp;<br>I grabbed the back of his shirt and hauled him off the railing, and we both collapsed into a heap on the floor. The crowd reaction was mixed. Some cheers and some boos. We got to our feet, and I cuffed his hands behind his back and led him to the elevator.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright 2006 by Evanovich, Inc.</div></div>&u<P><BR><i>Continues...</i><BR></i></b></blockquote><P><BR><blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><BR>Excerpted from <b>Twelve Sharp</b><BR> by <b>Evanovich, Janet</b> <BR>Copyright &copy; 2006  by Evanovich, Janet.<BR> Excerpted by permission.<br> All rights reserved.
