											A Long Way Gone is a memoir by Ishmael Beah. Ishmael Beah recollects his life a a boy soldier in a time of devestating war. At the beginning of the book, Ishmael and his younger brother are travelling to a musical competition when they learn that their corrupt government has began attacking thei villiages. When Ishmaels brother dies, he is forced to traverse on alone and try to find his way to survive. When he reaches a 'safe camp' he is informed that his entire family has been killed in the attacks. He was then given the opportunity to seek revenge against those who killed his family by joining the army. Beah does a phenomenal job of recollecting his youth and the atrocities he witnessed. <p/><p/>I would certainly reccommend this book to anyone looking for an enthralling novel. This book is brilliantly written, impactful, and a real page-turner. A Long Way Gone prevokes the readers mind and shows them the side of war that we are natrually sheltered from. Not only do you as a reader realize the harsh realities that these young boys went through, but you feel the need to reach out and help.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Ap World History Book Review<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1389486_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781616826543_BK_2_1389486" href="#previewReview_1389486" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 16, 2010: 
											A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah is an amazing story about Beah and his journey through life in Sierra Leone as he was forced to become a soldier at the age of twelve. He had no choice but to leave his home when rebels came to his village. Without knowledge of the whereabouts of his relatives he had to look for refuge not knowing if or when he would ever see his family again. Being only a child, he was forced to go into war and kill others. This book gives you a chilling insight as to what goes on during wars in other countries. This book reveals the tragic events that many other children in Sierra Leone had to go through during that time period. While the book is sad, you want to keep reading to find out what happens up until the end. <p/><p/>I would highly reccommend this book to anyone. It is easy to understand and Ishmael uses great detail that creates a lot of imagery. The fact that this is from his first hand experience adds even more to the meaning of this book. This really opened my eyes to the tragic events that such young children had to go through. If you are looking for a book that will leave a lasting impression on you, than A Long Way Gone is definitely the book for you.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>By now, nearly every habitual news watcher knows that child soldiers are being used as human pawns in dozens of conflicts around the world. Indeed, the figures are staggering: As many as 300,000 children are currently fighting in wars. Behind these distressing figures, of course, are real-life children, some as young as 8. Journalistic reconstructions can take us only so far into the lives of these boys; we had to wait for this firsthand account by Sierra Leone native Ishmael Beah to truly understand this ghastly, life-shattering practice. Beah was only 13 when he was handed an AK-47 and sent off to the killing fields. A bracing memoir about a survivor in a world gone mad.
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><p><I><p><I>My new friends have begun to suspect I haven&#8217;t told them the full story of my life.<BR>&#8220;Why did you leave Sierra Leone?&#8221;<BR>&#8220;Because there is a war.&#8221;<BR>&#8220;You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?&#8221;<BR>&#8220;Yes, all the time.&#8221;<BR>&#8220;Cool.&#8221;<BR>I smile a little.<BR>&#8220;You should tell us about it sometime.&#8221;<BR>&#8220;Yes, sometime.&#8221;</I><p></I><p>This is how wars are fought now&#58; by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them.<BR><BR>What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.<BR><BR>In <I>A Long Way Gone</I>, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story&#58; how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he&#8217;d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts.<p> <p>This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.<p><p>
</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Carolyn See</h3><p>Everyone in the world should read this book. Not just because it contains an amazing story, or because it's our moral, bleeding-heart duty, or because it's clearly written. We should read it to learn about the world and about what it means to be human.</p><h3>The New York Times
 - 
								William Boyd</h3><p>Beah�s memoir joins an elite class of writing: Africans witnessing African wars. I think of <i>Sozaboy</i>, Ken Saro-Wiwa�s masterly novel about a young soldier during the Biafran war, or <i>Machete Season</i>, Jean Hatzfeld�s book of blood-chilling interviews with Rwandan killers. <i>A Long Way Gone</i> makes you wonder how anyone comes through such unrelenting ghastliness and horror with his humanity and sanity intact. Unusually, the smiling, open face of the author on the book jacket provides welcome and timely reassurance. Ishmael Beah seems to prove it can happen.</p><h3>The New Yorker</h3><p>In 1993, when the author was twelve, rebel forces attacked his home town, in Sierra Leone, and he was separated from his parents. For months, he straggled through the war-torn countryside, starving and terrified, until he was taken under the wing of a Shakespeare-spouting lieutenant in the government army. Soon, he was being fed amphetamines and trained to shoot an AK-47 (&ldquo;Ignore the safety pin, they said, it will only slow you down&rdquo;). Beah&rsquo;s memoir documents his transformation from a child into a hardened, brutally efficient soldier who high-fived his fellow-recruits after they slaughtered their enemies&mdash;often boys their own age&mdash;and who &ldquo;felt no pity for anyone.&rdquo; His honesty is exacting, and a testament to the ability of children &ldquo;to outlive their sufferings, if given a chance.&rdquo;</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Beah's harrowing story of a boy caught up in the civil strife in Sierra Leone is not an audio to curl up with before bedtime. Beah's even-toned narrative is particularly disturbing because it's almost exactly the same whether he is enjoying the company of a newly found uncle or busy shooting and maiming rebels and even burying them alive. His monotone works particularly well when he is recounting his dreams, for he cannot distinguish his nightmares from his waking life. Beah speaks with a thick accent that omits "th" sounds. Many words are understandable in their context, but a few are not. He also stumbles over some longer and more complex words. Despite these drawbacks, Beah's tale is a riveting snapshot of childhoods stolen from all too many, not just in Sierra Leone but in Somalia, Iraq, Palestine and other places ravaged by civil wars. <I>Simultaneous release with the FSG hardcover (Reviews, Dec. 18).

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This absorbing account by a young man who, as a  boy of 12, gets swept up in Sierra Leone's civil war goes beyond  even the best journalistic efforts in revealing the life and  mind of a child abducted into the horrors of warfare. Beah's  harrowing journey transforms him overnight from a child  enthralled by American hip-hop music and dance to an internal  refugee bereft of family, wandering from village to village in a  country grown deeply divided by the indiscriminate atrocities of  unruly, sociopathic rebel and army forces. Beah then finds  himself in the army-in a drug-filled life of casual mass  slaughter that lasts until he is 15, when he's brought to a  rehabilitation center sponsored by UNICEF and partnering NGOs.  The process marks out Beah as a gifted spokesman for the  center's work after his "repatriation" to civilian life in the  capital, where he lives with his family and a distant uncle.  When the war finally engulfs the capital, it sends 17-year-old  Beah fleeing again, this time to the U.S., where he now lives.  (Beah graduated from Oberlin College in 2004.) Told in clear,  accessible language by a young writer with a gifted literary  voice, this memoir seems destined to become a classic firsthand  account of war and the ongoing plight of child soldiers in  conflicts worldwide.

</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>This remarkable firsthand account shows how civil strife destroys lives. Ishmael Beah was twelve years old in 1993 when insurrection tore apart his native country of Sierra Leone. Separated from his family, Ishmael joined up with other traumatized young boys wandering the countryside, looking for family, food, and shelter. Often they were cruelly treated by frightened villagers, but occasionally they encountered selfless kindness. Day after day, they witnessed atrocities and narrowly escaped death. Months later, the starving thirteen-year-old was recruited into a government militia, and for the next two years, fought alongside other child soldiers. Equipped with an AK-47 and morally anaesthetized with hard drugs, Beah became a remorseless killer. The horrors he saw or perpetrated still haunt him and will be difficult for the reader to forget. By great good fortune, he was rescued by a UNICEF team and slowly rehabilitated in a group home for child soldiers. A lucky visit to the United States to address a UN committee gave him a friend in New York and an eventual refuge when Sierra Leone was again wracked by a military coup in 1997. Beah writes his story with painful honesty, horrifying detail, and touches of remarkable lyricism. This young writer has a bright future. Unfortunately his second-language English is still sometimes clumsy and syntactically awkward; more skillful editing might have made the book a classic. As children fight on in dreadful wars around the globe, Beah's story is a must for every school collection.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>Rarely does one encounter anything but outrage, sadness, and pain when reading about the exploitation of child soldiers, but Beah's account also offers hope, humility, bravery, and, yes, peace. Beah was 13 years old when rebels attacked nearby villages in his native Sierra Leone. He was separated from his family (he learned later that they perished) and was on the run from both the rebels and the Sierra Leone Military Forces for over a year. Eventually captured by the military, which could behave as horrendously as the rebels, the boy was forced to join the army, carrying guns or grenade launchers. Like the thousands of other children traumatized by these events, Beah needed rehabilitation when his "tour of duty" was over. A former juvenile center turned counseling house afforded him a safe haven. After being chosen to speak at a UN conference in New York, he began the long process of relocating to the United States. The brutality of war is brought out early in this narrative, and just to have survived is amazing. Beah writes with frankness and honesty about his experiences but also with other people in mind; his account of the healing process after the horrors he saw is remarkable. His book, especially relevant in today's world, should be in all high school, public, and academic libraries. [See Prepub Alert, <i>LJ</i>11/15/06; Beah's book is the second title in the new Starbucks book program.—Ed.]</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>The survivor of a dirty war in starkest Africa recounts his transition from 12-year-old orphan to killing machine. To emerge from Sierra Leone's malignant civil conflict and eventually graduate from college in the U.S. marks Beah as very unusual, if not unique. His memoir seeks to illuminate the process that created, and continues to create, one of the most pitiable yet universally feared products of modern warfare: the boy soldier. It illustrates how, in African nations under the stress of open civil war, youthful males cluster in packs for self-protection, fleeing the military forces of all sides, distrusted and persecuted by strangers they encounter, until they are killed or commandeered as recruits. Nearly half the text deals with Beah's life as a fugitive after marauding rebel troops ravaged his home village. He fled with several other boys, but they were separated during another attack and he was forced to spend several weeks alone in the bush; the loneliness there instilled a craving for human companionship of any type. The regular military finally snared Beah and some new companions, telling them they must train as soldiers or die. The rebels, they were assured, were responsible for killing their families and destroying their homes; as soldiers, they would exact manly revenge and serve the nation. Cocaine, marijuana and painkillers became the boys' mind-numbing daily diet. They were indoctrinated by practicing mayhem on tethered prisoners and became willing experts at lying in ambush with their aging AK-47 rifles. For them, killing human beings had replaced ordinary child's play. Beah's halting narrative has confusing time shifts, but it's hideously effective in conveying theessential horror of his experiences.

�A Long Way Gone is one of the most important war stories of our generation. The arming of children is among the greatest evils of the modern world, and yet we know so little about it because the children themselves 

are swallowed up by the very wars they are forced to wage. Ishmael Beah has not only emerged intact from this chaos, he has become one of its most eloquent chroniclers. We ignore his message at our peril.� 

?Sebastian Junger, author of A Death in Belmont and The Perfect Storm<p>

�This is a beautifully written book. Ishmael Beah describes the unthinkable in calm, unforgettable language; his memoir is an important testament to the children elsewhere who continue to be conscripted into armies 

and militias.�
�Steve Coll, author of Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001<p>
 
�A Long Way Gone is a wrenching, beautiful, and mesmerizing tale. Beah�s amazing saga provides a haunting lesson about how gentle folks can be capable of great brutalities as well as goodness and courage. It will 

leave you breathless.�
�Walter Isaacson, author of Benjamin Franklin: An American Life<p>

<b>About This Guide</b><p>
The questions and discussion topics that follow are designed to enhance your reading of Ishmael Beah�s A Long Way Gone. We hope they will enrich your experience as you explore his inspiring, infinitely valuable 

story.<p>

<b>Introduction</b><p>
An estimated 300,000 child soldiers now fight in the more than fifty violent conflicts raging around the globe. Far removed from the world of pundits and journalists, policymakers and diplomats, a thirteen-year-old boy 

named Ishmael Beah became one of these young warriors in Sierra Leone. Now in his mid-twenties, he courageously tells of the horrific road that led him to wield an AK-47 and, fueled by trauma and drugs, commit 

terrible acts. A Long Way Gone brings a rare voice of frontline realism to a widely publicized (and widely misunderstood) human-rights crisis.<p> 

In poignantly clear and dauntless storytelling, Ishmael describes how he fled brutal rebel soldiers, traveling miles from home on foot and gradually being reduced to a life of raw survival instincts. Yet, unlike so many of 

his peers, Ishmael lived to reclaim his true self, emerging from Sierra Leone as the gentle, hopeful young man he was at heart. His memoir is at once crucial testimony for understanding the tragedy of contemporary 

war zones, and a testament to the power of peacemakers.<p>

<b>Questions for Discussion</b><p>
1. How familiar were you with the civil wars of Sierra Leone prior to reading A Long Way Gone? How has Ishmael�s story changed your perception of this history, and of current wars in general?<p> 

2. Chapter seven begins with the story of the imam�s death, followed by Ishmael�s recollections of his father and an elder blessing their home when they first moved to Mogbwemo. How do the concepts of faith and 

hope shift throughout this memoir? What sustains Ishmael emotionally and spiritually?<p> 

3. Chapter eight closes with the image of villagers running fearfully from Ishmael and his friends, believing that the seven boys are rebels. How do they overcome these negative assumptions in communities that have 

begun to associate the boys� appearance with evil? What lessons could world leaders learn from them about overcoming distrust, and the importance of judging others individually rather than as stereotypes?<p>

4. What did Ishmael�s parents teach him about being a man? How did he define manhood once he began his long walk west? What general life lessons were his parents able to teach him that sustained him during his 

brutal passage from boyhood, and that he carries with him to this day?<p> 

5. Discuss the role of American hip-hop culture in creating a �soundtrack� for Ishmael�s life. Why are rappers so appealing to him?<p> 

6. The boys� discovery of the Atlantic Ocean and their encounter with a cheerful fisherman who heals and feeds them is followed by the tragedy of Saidu�s death after a bird falls ominously from the sky. Discuss 

Ishmael�s relationship with the natural world. In what way is he guided by the constancy of the earth and sky?<p>

7. When Ishmael arrives at the fortified village of Yele in chapter twelve, what do you discover about the way he began his military career? Was his service, and that of his equally young friends, necessary? What made 

his conscription different from that of drafted American soldiers serving in previous wars?<p> 
 
8. Ishmael tells us that some of the boys who had been rehabilitated with him later became soldiers again. What factors ensured that he could remain a civilian?<p> 

9. Storytelling is a powerful force in Ishmael�s life, even providing a connection to his future mother, Laura Simms. What traits make Ishmael a memorable and unique storyteller? How does his perspective compare to 

the perspectives of filmmakers, reporters, or other authors who have recently tried to portray Africa�s civil wars?<p> 

10. Ishmael describes his use of Krio and many tribal languages to communicate, as well as his ability to quote Shakespeare�s Elizabethan English. What communities and empires are represented in his many 

speech styles? In which �villages,� from the relatively new UN to the centuries-old Mende and Temne settlements, does the greatest wisdom lie?<p> 

11. How does Ishmael�s concept of family change throughout the memoir, from his early life in Mattru Jong, to the uncle with whom he is reunited, to his American family with Laura?<p>

12. It takes many weeks before Ishmael feels comfortable with the relief workers� refrain that these events are not his fault. What destructive beliefs had he become addicted to? What states of deprivation and euphoria 

had his body become addicted to?<p>

13. What universal truths does Ishmael teach us about surviving loss and hunger, and overcoming isolation?<p>

14. Ishmael�s dramatic escape during the later waves of revolution concludes with the riddle of the monkey. Is his dream of obliterating the monkey�and its violent endgames�closer to being fulfilled in these early 

years of the twenty-first century? What would it take for all of humanity to adopt Ishmael�s rejection of vengeance?<p>

15. Ishmael gives credit to relief workers such as Esther, in conjunction with organizations such as UNICEF, for rescuing him. He has dedicated his life to their cause, studying political science and speaking before a 

broad variety of groups, ranging from the Council on Foreign Relations to the Center for Emerging Threats and Opportunities at the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory. What steps has he inspired you to take to help 

end the use of child soldiers? How can each of us join Ishmael�s cause?<p>

16. After reading the chronology of Sierra Leone�s history, what reasons can you propose for the coups in Ishmael�s homeland? Did the arrival of Portuguese slave traders, or the later colonization by the British, 

contribute to Sierra Leone�s twentieth-century woes? What did you discover about the motivations of the army soldiers versus those of the rebels? In your opinion, what made the leaders of the RUF so ruthless for so 

long?<p>

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><p><B>Chapter One</B> <p>There were all kinds of stories told about the war that made it sound as if it was happening in a faraway and different land. It wasn&#8217;t until refugees started passing through our town that we began to see that it was actually taking place in our country. Families who had walked hundreds of miles told how relatives had been killed and their houses burned. Some people felt sorry for them and offered them places to stay, but most of the refugees refused, because they said the war would eventually reach our town. The children of these families wouldn&#8217;t look at us, and they jumped at the sound of chopping wood or as stones landed on the tin roofs flung by children hunting birds with slingshots. The adults among these children from the war zones would be lost in their thoughts during conversations with the elders of my town. Apart from their fatigue and malnourishment, it was evident they had seen something that plagued their minds, something that we would refuse to accept if they told us all of it. At times I thought that some of the stories the passersby told were exaggerated. The only wars I knew of were those that I had read about in books or seen in movies such as Rambo&#58; First Blood, and the one in neighboring Liberia that I had heard about on the BBC news. My imagination at ten years old didn&#8217;t have the capacity to grasp what had taken away the happiness of the refugees.<BR> <BR> The first time that I was touched by war I was twelve. It was in January of 1993. I left home with Junior, my older brother, and our friend Talloi, both a year older than I, to go to the town of Mattru Jong, to participate in our friends&#8217; talent show.Mohamed, my best friend, couldn&#8217;t come because he and his father were renovating their thatched-roof kitchen that day. The four of us had started a rap and dance group when I was eight. We were first introduced to rap music during one of our visits to Mobimbi, a quarter where the foreigners who worked for the same American company as my father lived. We often went to Mobimbi to swim in a pool and watch the huge color television and the white people who crowded the visitors&#8217; recreational area. One evening a music video that consisted of a bunch of young black fellows talking really fast came on the television. The four of us sat there mesmerized by the song, trying to understand what the black fellows were saying. At the end of the video, some letters came up at the bottom of the screen. They read &#8220;Sugarhill Gang, &#8216;Rapper&#8217;s Delight.&#8217;&#8221; Junior quickly wrote it down on a piece of paper. After that, we came to the quarters every other weekend to study that kind of music on television. We didn&#8217;t know what it was called then, but I was impressed with the fact that the black fellows knew how to speak English really fast, and to the beat. <BR> <BR> Later on, when Junior went to secondary school, he befriended some boys who taught him more about foreign music and dance. During holidays, he brought me cassettes and taught my friends and me how to dance to what we came to know as hip-hop. I loved the dance, and particularly enjoyed learning the lyrics, because they were poetic and it improved my vocabulary. One afternoon, Father came home while Junior, Mohamed, Talloi, and I were learning the verse of &#8220;I Know You Got Soul&#8221; by Eric B. &amp; Rakim. He stood by the door of our clay brick and tin roof house laughing and then asked, &#8220;Can you even understand what you are saying?&#8221; He left before Junior could answer. He sat in a hammock under the shade of the mango, guava, and orange trees and tuned his radio to the BBC news.<BR> <BR> &#8220;Now, this is good English, the kind that you should be listening to,&#8221; he shouted from the yard.<BR> <BR> While Father listened to the news, Junior taught us how to move our feet to the beat. We alternately moved our right and then our left feet to the front and back, and simultaneously did the same with our arms, shaking our upper bodies and heads. &#8220;This move is called the running man,&#8221; Junior said. Afterward, we would practice miming the rap songs we had memorized. Before we parted to carry out our various evening chores of fetching water and cleaning lamps, we would say &#8220;Peace, son&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m out,&#8221; phrases we had picked up from the rap lyrics. Outside, the evening music of birds and crickets would commence.<BR> <BR> On the morning that we left for Mattru Jong, we loaded our backpacks with notebooks of lyrics we were working on and stuffed our pockets with cassettes of rap albums. In those days we wore baggy jeans, and underneath them we had soccer shorts and sweatpants for dancing. Under our long-sleeved shirts we had sleeveless undershirts, T-shirts, and soccer jerseys. We wore three pairs of socks that we pulled down and folded to make our crapes* look puffy. When it got too hot in the day, we took some of the clothes off and carried them on our shoulders. They were fashionable, and we had no idea that this unusual way of dressing was going to benefit us. Since we intended to return the next day, we didn&#8217;t say goodbye or tell anyone where we were going. We didn&#8217;t know that we were leaving home, never to return.<BR> <BR> To save money, we decided to walk the sixteen miles to Mattru Jong. It was a beautiful summer day, the sun wasn&#8217;t too hot, and the walk didn&#8217;t feel long either, as we chatted about all kinds of things, mocked and chased each other. We carried slingshots that we used to stone birds and chase the monkeys that tried to cross the main dirt road. We stopped at several rivers to swim. At one river that had a bridge across it, we heard a passenger vehicle in the distance and decided to get out of the water and see if we could catch a free ride. I got out before Junior and Talloi, and ran across the bridge with their clothes. They thought they could catch up with me before the vehicle reached the bridge, but upon realizing that it was impossible, they started running back to the river, and just when they were in the middle of the bridge, the vehicle caught up to them. The girls in the truck laughed and the driver tapped his horn. It was funny, and for the rest of the trip they tried to get me back for what I had done, but they failed.<BR> <BR> We arrived at Kabati, my grandmother&#8217;s village, around two in the afternoon. Mamie Kpana was the name that my grandmother was known by. She was tall and her perfectly long face complemented her beautiful cheekbones and big brown eyes. She always stood with her hands either on her hips or on her head. By looking at her, I could see where my mother had gotten her beautiful dark skin, extremely white teeth, and the translucent creases on her neck. My grandfather or kamor&#8212;teacher, as everyone called him&#8212;was a well-known local Arabic scholar and healer in the village and beyond.<BR> <BR> At Kabati, we ate, rested a bit, and started the last six miles. Grandmother wanted us to spend the night, but we told her that we would be back the following day.<BR> <BR> &#8220;How is that father of yours treating you these days?&#8221; she asked in a sweet voice that was laden with worry.<BR> <BR> &#8220;Why are you going to Mattru Jong, if not for school? And why do you look so skinny?&#8221; she continued asking, but we evaded her questions. She followed us to the edge of the village and watched as we descended the hill, switching her walking stick to her left hand so that she could wave us off with her right hand, a sign of good luck.<BR> <BR> We arrived in Mattru Jong a couple of hours later and met up with old friends, Gibrilla, Kaloko, and Khalilou. That night we went out to Bo Road, where street vendors sold food late into the night. We bought boiled groundnut and ate it as we conversed about what we were going to do the next day, made plans to see the space for the talent show and practice. We stayed in the verandah room of Khalilou&#8217;s house. The room was small and had a tiny bed, so the four of us (Gibrilla and Kaloko went back to their houses) slept in the same bed, lying across with our feet hanging. I was able to fold my feet in a little more since I was shorter and smaller than all the other boys.<BR> <BR> The next day Junior, Talloi, and I stayed at Khalilou&#8217;s house and waited for our friends to return from school at around 2&#58;00 p.m. But they came home early. I was cleaning my crapes and counting for Junior and Talloi, who were having a push-up competition. Gibrilla and Kaloko walked onto the verandah and joined the competition. Talloi, breathing hard and speaking slowly, asked why they were back. Gibrilla explained that the teachers had told them that the rebels had attacked Mogbwemo, our home. School had been canceled until further notice. We stopped what we were doing.<BR> <BR> According to the teachers, the rebels had attacked the mining areas in the afternoon. The sudden outburst of gunfire had caused people to run for their lives in different directions. Fathers had come running from their workplaces, only to stand in front of their empty houses with no indication of where their families had gone. Mothers wept as they ran toward schools, rivers, and water taps to look for their children. Children ran home to look for parents who were wandering the streets in search of them. And as the gunfire intensified, people gave up looking for their loved ones and ran out of town.<BR> <BR> &#8220;This town will be next, according to the teachers.&#8221; Gibrilla lifted himself from the cement floor. Junior, Talloi, and I took our backpacks and headed to the wharf with our friends. There, people were arriving from all over the mining area. Some we knew, but they couldn&#8217;t tell us the whereabouts of our families. They said the attack had been too sudden, too chaotic; that everyone had fled in different directions in total confusion.<BR> <BR> For more than three hours, we stayed at the wharf, anxiously waiting and expecting either to see our families or to talk to someone who had seen them. But there was no news of them, and after a while we didn&#8217;t know any of the people who came across the river. The day seemed oddly normal. The sun peacefully sailed through the white clouds, birds sang from treetops, the trees danced to the quiet wind. I still couldn&#8217;t believe that the war had actually reached our home. It is impossible, I thought. When we left home the day before, there had been no indication the rebels were anywhere near.<BR> <BR> &#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; Gibrilla asked us. We were all quiet for a while, and then Talloi broke the silence. &#8220;We must go back and see if we can find our families before it is too late.&#8221;<BR> <BR> Junior and I nodded in agreement.<BR> <BR> Just three days earlier, I had seen my father walking slowly from work. His hard hat was under his arm and his long face was sweating from the hot afternoon sun. I was sitting on the verandah. I had not seen him for a while, as another stepmother had destroyed our relationship again. But that morning my father smiled at me as he came up the steps. He examined my face, and his lips were about to utter something, when my stepmother came out. He looked away, then at my stepmother, who pretended not to see me. They quietly went into the parlor. I held back my tears and left the verandah to meet with Junior at the junction where we waited for the lorry. We were on our way to see our mother in the next town about three miles away. When our father had paid for our school, we had seen her on weekends over the holidays when we were back home. Now that he refused to pay, we visited her every two or three days. That afternoon we met Mother at the market and walked with her as she purchased ingredients to cook for us. Her face was dull at first, but as soon as she hugged us, she brightened up. She told us that our little brother, Ibrahim, was at school and that we would go get him on our way from the market. She held our hands as we walked, and every so often she would turn around as if to see whether we were still with her.<BR> <BR> As we walked to our little brother&#8217;s school, Mother turned to us and said, &#8220;I am sorry I do not have enough money to put you boys back in school at this point. I am working on it.&#8221; She paused and then asked, &#8220;How is your father these days?&#8221;<BR> <BR> &#8220;He seems all right. I saw him this afternoon,&#8221; I replied. Junior didn&#8217;t say anything.<BR> <BR> Mother looked him directly in the eyes and said, &#8220;Your father is a good man and he loves you very much. He just seems to attract the wrong stepmothers for you boys.&#8221;<BR> <BR> When we got to the school, our little brother was in the yard playing soccer with his friends. He was eight and pretty good for his age. As soon as he saw us, he came running, throwing himself on us. He measured himself against me to see if he had gotten taller than me. Mother laughed. My little brother&#8217;s small round face glowed, and sweat formed around the creases he had on his neck, just like my mother&#8217;s. All four of us walked to Mother&#8217;s house. I held my little brother&#8217;s hand, and he told me about school and challenged me to a soccer game later in the evening. My mother was single and devoted herself to taking care of Ibrahim. She said he sometimes asked about our father. When Junior and I were away in school, she had taken Ibrahim to see him a few times, and each time she had cried when my father hugged Ibrahim, because they were both so happy to see each other. My mother seemed lost in her thoughts, smiling as she relived the moments.<BR> <BR> Two days after that visit, we had left home. As we now stood at the wharf in Mattru Jong, I could visualize my father holding his hard hat and running back home from work, and my mother, weeping and running to my little brother&#8217;s school. A sinking feeling overtook me.<BR> <BR> Junior, Talloi, and I jumped into a canoe and sadly waved to our friends as the canoe pulled away from the shores of Mattru Jong. As we landed on the other side of the river, more and more people were arriving in haste. We started walking, and a woman carrying her flip-flops on her head spoke without looking at us&#58; &#8220;Too much blood has been spilled where you are going. Even the good spirits have fled from that place.&#8221; She walked past us. In the bushes along the river, the strained voices of women cried out, &#8220;Nguwor gbor mu ma oo,&#8221; God help us, and screamed the names of their children&#58; &#8220;Yusufu, Jabu, Foday . . .&#8221; We saw children walking by themselves, shirtless, in their underwear, following the crowd. &#8220;Nya nje oo, nya keke oo,&#8221; my mother, my father, the children were crying. There were also dogs running, in between the crowds of people, who were still running, even though far away from harm. The dogs sniffed the air, looking for their owners. My veins tightened.<BR> <BR> We had walked six miles and were now at Kabati, Grandmother&#8217;s village. It was deserted. All that was left were footprints in the sand leading toward the dense forest that spread out beyond the village.<BR> <BR> As evening approached, people started arriving from the mining area. Their whispers, the cries of little children seeking lost parents and tired of walking, and the wails of hungry babies replaced the evening songs of crickets and birds. We sat on Grandmother&#8217;s verandah, waiting and listening.<BR> <BR> &#8220;Do you guys think it is a good idea to go back to Mogbwemo?&#8221; Junior asked. But before either of us had a chance to answer, a Volkswagen roared in the distance and all the people walking on the road ran into the nearby bushes. We ran, too, but didn&#8217;t go that far. My heart pounded and my breathing intensified. The vehicle stopped in front of my grandmother&#8217;s house, and from where we lay, we could see that whoever was inside the car was not armed. As we, and others, emerged from the bushes, we saw a man run from the driver&#8217;s seat to the sidewalk, where he vomited blood. His arm was bleeding. When he stopped vomiting, he began to cry. It was the first time I had seen a grown man cry like a child, and I felt a sting in my heart. A woman put her arms around the man and begged him to stand up. He got to his feet and walked toward the van. When he opened the door opposite the driver&#8217;s, a woman who was leaning against it fell to the ground. Blood was coming out of her ears. People covered the eyes of their children.<BR> <BR> In the back of the van were three more dead bodies, two girls and a boy, and their blood was all over the seats and the ceiling of the van. I wanted to move away from what I was seeing, but couldn&#8217;t. My feet went numb and my entire body froze. Later we learned that the man had tried to escape with his family and the rebels had shot at his vehicle, killing all his family. The only thing that consoled him, for a few seconds at least, was when the woman who had embraced him, and now cried with him, told him that at least he would have the chance to bury them. He would always know where they were laid to rest, she said. She seemed to know a little more about war than the rest of us.<BR> <BR> The wind had stopped moving and daylight seemed to be quickly giving in to night. As sunset neared, more people passed through the village. One man carried his dead son. He thought the boy was still alive. The father was covered with his son&#8217;s blood, and as he ran he kept saying, &#8220;I will get you to the hospital, my boy, and everything will be fine.&#8221; Perhaps it was necessary that he cling to false hopes, since they kept him running away from harm. A group of men and women who had been pierced by stray bullets came running next. The skin that hung down from their bodies still contained fresh blood. Some of them didn&#8217;t notice that they were wounded until they stopped and people pointed to their wounds. Some fainted or vomited. I felt nauseated, and my head was spinning. I felt the ground moving, and people&#8217;s voices seemed to be far removed from where I stood trembling.<BR> <BR> The last casualty that we saw that evening was a woman who carried her baby on her back. Blood was running down her dress and dripping behind her, making a trail. Her child had been shot dead as she ran for her life. Luckily for her, the bullet didn&#8217;t go through the baby&#8217;s body. When she stopped at where we stood, she sat on the ground and removed her child. It was a girl, and her eyes were still open, with an interrupted innocent smile on her face. The bullets could be seen sticking out just a little bit in the baby&#8217;s body and she was swelling. The mother clung to her child and rocked her. She was in too much pain and shock to shed tears.<BR> <BR> Junior, Talloi, and I looked at each other and knew that we must return to Mattru Jong, because we had seen that Mogbwemo was no longer a place to call home and that our parents couldn&#8217;t possibly be there anymore. Some of the wounded people kept saying that Kabati was next on the rebels&#8217; list. We didn&#8217;t want to be there when the rebels arrived. Even those who couldn&#8217;t walk very well did their best to keep moving away from Kabati. The image of that woman and her baby plagued my mind as we walked back to Mattru Jong. I barely noticed the journey, and when I drank water I didn&#8217;t feel any relief even though I knew I was thirsty. I didn&#8217;t want to go back to where that woman was from; it was clear in the eyes of the baby that all had been lost.<BR> <BR>Excerpted from A Long Way Gone&#58; Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah.

It wasn't until refugees started passing through our town that we began to see that it was actually taking place in our country. Families who had walked hundreds of miles told how relatives had been killed and their houses burned. Some people felt sorry for them and offered them places to stay, but most of the refugees refused, because they said the war would eventually reach our town. The children of these families wouldn't look at us, and they jumped at the sound of chopping wood or as stones landed on the tin roofs flung by children hunting birds with slingshots. The adults among these children from the war zones would be lost in their thoughts during conversations with the elders of my town. Apart from their fatigue and malnourishment, it was evident they had seen something that plagued their minds, something that we would refuse to accept if they told us all of it. At times I thought that some of the stories the passersby told were exaggerated. The only wars I knew of were those that I had read about in books or seen in movies such as Rambo&#58; First Blood, and the one in neighboring Liberia that I had heard about on the BBC news. My imagination at ten years old didn't have the capacity to grasp what had taken away the happiness of the refugees. <p>The first time that I was touched by war I was twelve. It was in January of 1993. I left home with Junior, my older brother, and our friend Talloi, both a year older than I, to go to the town of Mattru Jong, to participate in our friends' talent show. Mohamed, my best friend, couldn't come because he and his father were renovating their thatched-roof kitchen that day. The four of us had started a rap and dance group when I was eight. We were first introduced to rap music during one of our visits to Mobimbi, a quarter where the foreigners who worked for the same American company as my father lived. We often went to Mobimbi to swim in a pool and watch the huge color television and the white people who crowded the visitors' recreational area. One evening a music video that consisted of a bunch of young black fellows talking really fast came on the television. The four of us sat there mesmerized by the song, trying to understand what the black fellows were saying. At the end of the video, some letters came up at the bottom of the screen. They read "Sugarhill Gang, 'Rapper's Delight.'" Junior quickly wrote it down on a piece of paper. After that, we came to the quarters every other weekend to study that kind of music on television. We didn't know what it was called then, but I was impressed with the fact that the black fellows knew how to speak English really fast, and to the beat. <p>   Later on, when Junior went to secondary school, he befriended some boys who taught him more about foreign music and dance. During holidays, he brought me cassettes and taught my friends and me how to dance to what we came to know as hip- hop. I loved the dance, and particularly enjoyed learning the lyrics, because they were poetic and it improved my vocabulary. One afternoon, Father came home while Junior, Mohamed, Talloi, and I were learning the verse of "I Know You Got Soul" by Eric B. & Rakim. He stood by the door of our clay brick and tin roof house laughing and then asked, "Can you even understand what you are saying?" He left before Junior could answer. He sat in a hammock under the shade of the mango, guava, and orange trees and tuned his radio to the BBC news. <p>   "Now, this is good English, the kind that you should be listening to," he shouted from the yard. <p>   While Father listened to the news, Junior taught us how to move our feet to the beat. We alternately moved our right and then our left feet to the front and back, and simultaneously did the same with our arms, shaking our upper bodies and heads. "This move is called the running man," Junior said. Afterward, we would practice miming the rap songs we had memorized. Before we parted to carry out our various evening chores of fetching water and cleaning lamps, we would say "Peace, son" or "I'm out," phrases we had picked up from the rap lyrics. Outside, the evening music of birds and crickets would commence. <p> <p> On the morning that we left for Mattru Jong, we loaded our backpacks with notebooks of lyrics we were working on and stuffed our pockets with cassettes of rap albums. In those days we wore baggy jeans, and underneath them we had soccer shorts and sweatpants for dancing. Under our long-sleeved shirts we had sleeveless undershirts, T-shirts, and soccer jerseys. We wore three pairs of socks that we pulled down and folded to make our crapes* look puffy. When it got too hot in the day, we took some of the clothes off and carried them on our shoulders. They were fashionable, and we had no idea that this unusual way of dressing was going to benefit us. Since we intended to return the next day, we didn't say goodbye or tell anyone where we were going. We didn't know that we were leaving home, never to return. <p>   To save money, we decided to walk the sixteen miles to Mattru Jong. It was a beautiful summer day, the sun wasn't too hot, and the walk didn't feel long either, as we chatted about all kinds of things, mocked and chased each other. We carried slingshots that we used to stone birds and chase the monkeys that tried to cross the main dirt road. We stopped at several rivers to swim. At one river that had a bridge across it, we heard a passenger vehicle in the distance and decided to get out of the water and see if we could catch a free ride. I got out before Junior and Talloi, and ran across the bridge with their clothes. They thought they could catch up with me before the vehicle reached the bridge, but upon realizing that it was impossible, they started running back to the river, and just when they were in the middle of the bridge, the vehicle caught up to them. The girls in the truck laughed and the driver tapped his horn. It was funny, and for the rest of the trip they tried to get me back for what I had done, but they failed. <p>   We arrived at Kabati, my grandmother's village, around two in the afternoon. Mamie Kpana was the name that my grandmother was known by. She was tall and her perfectly long face complemented her beautiful cheekbones and big brown eyes. She always stood with her hands either on her hips or on her head. By looking at her, I could see where my mother had gotten her beautiful dark skin, extremely white teeth, and the translucent creases on her neck. My grandfather or kamor-teacher, as everyone called him-was a well-known local Arabic scholar and healer in the village and beyond. <p>   At Kabati, we ate, rested a bit, and started the last six miles. Grandmother wanted us to spend the night, but we told her that we would be back the following day. <p>   "How is that father of yours treating you these days?" she asked in a sweet voice that was laden with worry. <p>   "Why are you going to Mattru Jong, if not for school? And why do you look so skinny?" she continued asking, but we evaded her questions. She followed us to the edge of the village and watched as we descended the hill, switching her walking stick to her left hand so that she could wave us off with her right hand, a sign of good luck. <p> <p> We arrived in Mattru Jong a couple of hours later and met up with old friends, Gibrilla, Kaloko, and Khalilou. That night we went out to Bo Road, where street vendors sold food late into the night. We bought boiled groundnut and ate it as we conversed about what we were going to do the next day, made plans to see the space for the talent show and practice. We stayed in the verandah room of Khalilou's house. The room was small and had a tiny bed, so the four of us (Gibrilla and Kaloko went back to their houses) slept in the same bed, lying across with our feet hanging. I was able to fold my feet in a little more since I was shorter and smaller than all the other boys. <p>   The next day Junior, Talloi, and I stayed at Khalilou's house and waited for our friends to return from school at around 2&#58;00 p.m. But they came home early. I was cleaning my crapes and counting for Junior and Talloi, who were having a push-up competition. Gibrilla and Kaloko walked onto the verandah and joined the competition. Talloi, breathing hard and speaking slowly, asked why they were back. Gibrilla explained that the teachers had told them that the rebels had attacked Mogbwemo, our home. School had been canceled until further notice. We stopped what we were doing. <p>   According to the teachers, the rebels had attacked the mining areas in the afternoon. The sudden outburst of gunfire had caused people to run for their lives in different directions. Fathers had come running from their workplaces, only to stand in front of their empty houses with no indication of where their families had gone. Mothers wept as they ran toward schools, rivers, and water taps to look for their children. Children ran home to look for parents who were wandering the streets in search of them. And as the gunfire intensified, people gave up looking for their loved ones and ran out of town. <p>   "This town will be next, according to the teachers." Gibrilla lifted himself from the cement floor. Junior, Talloi, and I took our backpacks and headed to the wharf with our friends. There, people were arriving from all over the mining area. Some we knew, but they couldn't tell us the whereabouts of our families. They said the attack had been too sudden, too chaotic; that everyone had fled in different directions in total confusion. <p>   For more than three hours, we stayed at the wharf, anxiously waiting and expecting either to see our families or to talk to someone who had seen them. But there was no news of them, and after a while we didn't know any of the people who came across the river. The day seemed oddly normal. The sun peacefully sailed through the white clouds, birds sang from treetops, the trees danced to the quiet wind. I still couldn't believe that the war had actually reached our home. It is impossible, I thought. When we left home the day before, there had been no indication the rebels were anywhere near. <p>   "What are you going to do?" Gibrilla asked us. We were all quiet for a while, and then Talloi broke the silence. "We must go back and see if we can find our families before it is too late." <p>   Junior and I nodded in agreement. <p> <p> Just three days earlier, I had seen my father walking slowly from work. His hard hat was under his arm and his long face was sweating from the hot afternoon sun. I was sitting on the verandah. I had not seen him for a while, as another stepmother had destroyed our relationship again. But that morning my father smiled at me as he came up the steps. He examined my face, and his lips were about to utter something, when my stepmother came out. He looked away, then at my stepmother, who pretended not to see me. They quietly went into the parlor. I held back my tears and left the verandah to meet with Junior at the junction where we waited for the lorry. We were on our way to see our mother in the next town about three miles away. When our father had paid for our school, we had seen her on weekends over the holidays when we were back home. Now that he refused to pay, we visited her every two or three days. That afternoon we met Mother at the market and walked with her as she purchased ingredients to cook for us. Her face was dull at first, but as soon as she hugged us, she brightened up. She told us that our little brother, Ibrahim, was at school and that we would go get him on our way from the market. She held our hands as we walked, and every so often she would turn around as if to see whether we were still with her. <p>   As we walked to our little brother's school, Mother turned to us and said, "I am sorry I do not have enough money to put you boys back in school at this point. I am working on it." She paused and then asked, "How is your father these days?" <p>   "He seems all right. I saw him this afternoon," I replied. Junior didn't say anything. <p>   Mother looked him directly in the eyes and said, "Your father is a good man and he loves you very much. He just seems to attract the wrong stepmothers for you boys." <p>   When we got to the school, our little brother was in the yard playing soccer with his friends. He was eight and pretty good for his age. As soon as he saw us, he came running, throwing himself on us. He measured himself against me to see if he had gotten taller than me. Mother laughed. My little brother's small round face glowed, and sweat formed around the creases he had on his neck, just like my mother's. All four of us walked to Mother's house. I held my little brother's hand, and he told me about school and challenged me to a soccer game later in the evening. My mother was single and devoted herself to taking care of Ibrahim. She said he sometimes asked about our father. When Junior and I were away in school, she had taken Ibrahim to see him a few times, and each time she had cried when my father hugged Ibrahim, because they were both so happy to see each other. My mother seemed lost in her thoughts, smiling as she relived the moments. <p>   Two days after that visit, we had left home. As we now stood at the wharf in Mattru Jong, I could visualize my father holding his hard hat and running back home from work, and my mother, weeping and running to my little brother's school. A sinking feeling overtook me. <p> <p> Junior, Talloi, and I jumped into a canoe and sadly waved to our friends as the canoe pulled away from the shores of Mattru Jong. As we landed on the other side of the river, more and more people were arriving in haste. We started walking, and a woman carrying her flip-flops on her head spoke without looking at us&#58; "Too much blood has been spilled where you are going. Even the good spirits have fled from that place." She walked past us. In the bushes along the river, the strained voices of women cried out, "Nguwor gbor mu ma oo," God help us, and screamed the names of their children&#58; "Yusufu, Jabu, Foday ..."  We saw children walking by themselves, shirtless, in their underwear, following the crowd. "Nya nje oo, nya keke oo," my mother, my father, the children were crying. There were also dogs running, in between the crowds of people, who were still running, even though far away from harm. The dogs sniffed the air, looking for their owners. My veins tightened. <p> <p> We had walked six miles and were now at Kabati, Grandmother's village. It was deserted. All that was left were footprints in the sand leading toward the dense forest that spread out beyond the village. <p>   As evening approached, people started arriving from the mining area. Their whispers, the cries of little children seeking lost parents and tired of walking, and the wails of hungry babies replaced the evening songs of crickets and birds. We sat on Grandmother's verandah, waiting and listening. <p>   "Do you guys think it is a good idea to go back to Mogbwemo?" Junior asked. But before either of us had a chance to answer, a Volkswagen roared in the distance and all the people walking on the road ran into the nearby bushes. We ran, too, but didn't go that far. My heart pounded and my breathing intensified. The vehicle stopped in front of my grandmother's house, and from where we lay, we could see that whoever was inside the car was not armed. As we, and others, emerged from the bushes, we saw a man run from the driver's seat to the sidewalk, where he vomited blood. His arm was bleeding. When he stopped vomiting, he began to cry. It was the first time I had seen a grown man cry like a child, and I felt a sting in my heart. A woman put her arms around the man and begged him to stand up. He got to his feet and walked toward the van. When he opened the door opposite the driver's, a woman who was leaning against it fell to the ground. Blood was coming out of her ears. People covered the eyes of their children. <p>   In the back of the van were three more dead bodies, two girls and a boy, and their blood was all over the seats and the ceiling of the van. I wanted to move away from what I was seeing, but couldn't. My feet went numb and my entire body froze. Later we learned that the man had tried to escape with his family and the rebels had shot at his vehicle, killing all his family. The only thing that consoled him, for a few seconds at least, was when the woman who had embraced him, and now cried with him, told him that at least he would have the chance to bury them. He would always know where they were laid to rest, she said. She seemed to know a little more about war than the rest of us. <p> <i>(Continues...)</i> <p> <p>  </i></b></blockquote> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'> Excerpted from <b>A Long Way Gone</b> by <b>Ishmael Beah</b> Copyright &copy; 2007  by Ishmael Beah.
