											This book has three stories by three great authors. The authors excel in paranormal romance. Gena Showalter, one of the authors is the reason I bought the book. Showalter's books are excellent. If paranormal romance is what you're after then the &quot;Lords of the Underworld&quot; series is one of the best series you could ever read. Characters are amazing to follow from one book to another they grow on you. Start with (in order); The Darkest Fire, The Darkest Night,The Darkest Kiss,The Darkest Pleasure,The Darkest Whisper,The Darkest Passion,The Darkest Lie,Dark Beginnings,The Darkest Facts and ending with Into the Dark. <p/>In this book SHowalter writes about a demon assassin,Lysander who is righteous and even a little judgmental of others. Then he meets a beautiful harpy, Bianka. Her father is Lucifer, and is tempted to act like he never has before. Its a fun afternoon read.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Excellent book.<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1333420_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780373774319_BK_1_1333420" href="#previewReview_1333420" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>March 13, 2010:

She has appeared in <i>Cosmo</i> and <i>Seventeen</i> magazines, on MTV, and has also been featured on many regional and national news programs.<p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p>Gena credits much of her success to her wonderful fans, amazing family, and the three slobbery English bulldogs who sleep under her desk.  She is a self proclaimed coffee addict and when she's not writing she likes to...well, we're not sure.  We've never seen her do anything but write.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>In the fall of 2009, Gena Showalter took some time to talk with us about her favorite books, authors, and interests.</i><br><br>  <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>  <i>Warrior's Woman</i> by Johanna Lindsey.  Before this book, I had only ever read historical romances.  But I was intrigued by the idea of a futuristic society, spaceships, females who could kick ass, and strong alpha men.  Then I started reading and intrigue became utter adoration.  I loved the story, and I realized I could write about anything I could imagine.<br><br>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b>  <br>  <i>A Hunger Like No Other</i> by Kresley Cole.  The hero chews and claws off his own leg to reach the heroine.  Now that is an act of love!  I'm still waiting for someone to do this for me.  But I digress.  I was glued to every page, couldn't put this down, and actually threatened my family with bodily harm when they dared interrupt my reading.  This is a true masterpiece, as well as the most amazing start to a series that I've ever read!  But then, <i>all</i> of Cole's books are masterpieces.    <br><br>  <i>Beyond the Highland Mist</i> by Karen Moning.  This was the first book I ever read featuring time travel and the Fae.  Plus, Karen paints such a vivid picture, I always feel like I'm in the book with the characters.  In this one, I time traveled with the heroine, I was seduced by the hero, and I was enveloped by magic.  To all three I say yes, yes, a thousand times yes.  <br><br>  <i>Welcome to Temptation</i> by Jennifer Cruise.  I have never laughed so hard while reading a book.  Cruise has the most amazing sense of humor -- humor that stems from her characters and their lives, rather than slapstick.  What's more, her characters are people I want so badly to hang out with.<br><br>    <i>Demon Moon</i> by Meljean Brook.  A vampire hero who knows how beautiful he is yet can't look into a mirror.  An everyday heroine I could identify with, even be.  And wow, is this book sexy!  Brook made me believe her characters were falling in love and by the end, I knew they were meant to be together.    <br><br>  <i>Slave to Sensation</i> by Nalini Singh.  A heroine who has been taught not to feel and a hero who lives by his emotions.  They balanced each other out, and watching them fall in love was so amazingly beautiful.  This is a truly powerful book.  <br><br>  <i>Warrior Rising</i> by P. C. Cast.  I love how P.C. twisted the story of Hercules to make it her own.  In this book, he has a beast trapped inside him and that's why he is such an indomitable, ferocious warrior.  Throw in a modern day heroine, white-hot attraction, and it's an instant page-turner! <br><br>    <i>Hitting the Mark</i> by Jill Monroe.  A hero undercover, a con artist heroine trying to go straight.  Perfection!  I loved their banter -- and the fact that the heroine wasn't afraid to dish the most delicious kind of revenge.  And then, how the two overcame their problems -- dreamy sigh.    <br><br>  <i>Twilight</i> by Stephenie Meyer.  I love the intensity of the hero's love.  I love how irresistible he finds the heroine.  I love how much they need each other.  Once I started reading, I couldn't stop.  First love meets true, everlasting love, and that's an irresistible combination for me.  <br><br>  <i>Lover Awakened</i> by J. R. Ward.  The hero was abused for many years, is physically scarred, and wants nothing to do with love.  But the heroine is attracted to him, and knows they belong together.  Plus, she's been abused, as well, and feels safest with him.  This book shows the healing power of love, is packed with gut-wrenching emotion and is utterly compelling.  <br><br>  <i>Red Fire</i> by Deidre Knight.  I was sold the moment I saw the book was about sexy Spartan warriors (I have a thing for warriors)  But there is so much more to the book.  It's an amazing blend of urban fantasy and romance, with those delicious warriors I mentioned, fighting gods and demons in modern day Savannah.  I love the way history, mythology and romance come together!   <br><br>  <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>    <i>Twilight</i>.  I loved seeing one of my favorite love stories come to life.<br><br>  <i>Anchorman</i>.  I laugh every time I watch this movie.  Will Ferrell is a comic genius.<br><br>  <i>Braveheart</i>.  Snippets of history, love, and the heartbreak of war.  So touching!<br><br>  <i>Idiocracy</i>.  Hilarious!  But hopefully not true.      <br><br>  <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b>  <br>    My tastes are eclectic.  Rock, pop, gospel, ballads, soundtracks, you name it, it's listed in my iTunes library and playing while I write.  <br><br>  <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b> <br>    Romances.  Always.  Especially the first in a series.  If l enjoy a series, I want the rest of the world to read and enjoy it, as well.  <br><br>  <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b>  <br>  I drink coffee while I write.  That way, I don't hurt the people around me and my characters get to live another day.  <br><br>  <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b>  <br>    I have so many rejection slips I can't even count them.  It took me four-five years to sell (after writing seven books).  Then it took me another four painful years to start hitting bestseller lists.  <br><br>  <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>    Write the book the way it needs to be written, not the way you think others will want you to write it.  If you love the story, that love will shine through.  Magic will happen.  <br><br></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>From the masters of paranormal romance, three brand-new tales of seduction&hellip;<P><i>The Darkest Angel</i> by Gena Showalter<P><i>A Lords of the Underworld tale</i><P>An iron-willed demon assassin, the angel Lysander has never known lust&mdash;until he meets Bianka.

Finally, I will end this. </i>His jaw clenched and his skin pulled tight. With tension. With relief. Determined, he jumped from the cloud he stood upon, falling quickly&hellip; wind whipping through his hair&hellip;<P>When he neared ground, he allowed his wings, long and feathered and golden, to unfold from his back and catch in the current, slowing his progress.<P>He was a soldier for the One True Deity. One of the Elite Seven, created before time itself. With as many millennia as he'd lived, he'd come to learn that each of the Elite Seven had one temptation. One potential downfall. Like Eve with her apple. When they found this&hellip;thing, this abomination, they happily destroyed it before it could destroy them.<P>Lysander had finally found his.<P>Bianka Skyhawk.<P>She was the daughter of a Harpy and a phoenix shape-shifter. She was a thief, a liar and a killer who found joy in the vilest of tasks. Worse, the blood of Lucifer&mdash;his greatest enemy and the sire of most demon hordes&mdash; flowed through her veins. Which meant <i>Bianka </i>was his enemy.<P>He lived to destroy his enemies.<P>However, he could only act against them when they broke a heavenly law. For demons, that involved escaping their fiery prison to walk the earth. For Bianka, who had never been condemned to hell, that would have to involve something else. What, he didn't know. All he knew was that he'd never experienced what mortals referred to as &#34;desire.&#34;<P>Until Bianka.<P>And he didn't like it.<P>He'd seen her for the first time several weeks ago, long black hair flowing down her back, amber eyes bright and lips bloodred. Watchingher, unable to turn away, a single question had drifted through his mind&#58; Was her pearl-like skin as soft as it appeared?<P>Forget desire. He'd never wondered such a thing about <i>anyone </i>before. He'd never cared. But the question was becoming an obsession, discovering the truth a need. And it had to end. Now. This day.<P>He landed just in front of her, but she couldn't see him. No one could. He existed on another plane, invisible to mortal and immortal alike. He could scream, and she would not hear him. He could walk through her, and she would not feel him. For that matter, she would not smell or sense him in any way.<P>Until it was too late.<P>He could have formed a fiery sword from air and cleaved her head from her body, but didn't. As he'd already realized and accepted, he could not kill her. Yet. But he could not allow her to roam unfettered, tempting him, a plague to his good sense, either. Which meant he would have to settle for imprisoning her in his home in the sky.<P>That didn't have to be a terrible ordeal for him, however. He could use their time together to show her the right way to live. And the right way was, of course, his way. What's more, if she did not conform, if she <i>did </i>finally commit that unpardonable sin, he would be there, at last able to rid himself of her influence.<P><i>Do it. Take her.</i><P>He reached out. But just before he could wrap his arms around her and fly her away, he realized she was no longer alone. He scowled, his arms falling to his sides. He did not want a witness to his deeds.<P>&#34;Best day ever,&#34; Bianka shouted skyward, splaying her arms and twirling. Two champagne bottles were clutched in her hands and those bottles flew from her grip, slamming into the ice-mountains of Alaska surrounding her. She stopped, swayed, laughed. &#34;Oopsie.&#34;<P>His scowl deepened. A perfect opportunity lost, he realized. Clearly, she was intoxicated. She wouldn't have fought him. Would have assumed he was a hallucination or that they were playing a game. Having watched her these past few weeks, he knew how much she liked to play games.<P>&#34;Waster,&#34; her sister, the intruder, grumbled. Though they were twins, Bianka and Kaia looked nothing alike. Kaia had red hair and gray eyes flecked with gold. She was shorter than Bianka, her beauty more delicate. &#34;I had to stalk a collector for days&mdash;days!&mdash;to steal that. Seriously. You just busted Dom P&#233;rignon White Gold Jeroboam.&#34;<P>&#34;I'll make it up to you.&#34; Mist wafted from Bianka's mouth. &#34;They sell Boone's Farm in town.&#34;<P>There was a pause, a sigh. &#34;That's only acceptable if you also steal me some cheese tots. I used to highjack them from Sabin every day, and now that we've left Budapest, I'm in withdrawal.&#34;<P>Lysander tried to pay attention to the conversation, he really did. But being this close to Bianka was, as always, ruining his concentration. Only her skin was similar to her sister's, reflecting all the colors of a newly sprung rainbow. So why didn't he wonder if <i>Kaia's </i>skin was as soft as it appeared?<P><i>Because she is not your temptation. You know this.</i><P>There, atop a peak of Devil's Thumb, he watched as Bianka plopped to her bottom. Frigid mist continued to waft around her, making her look as if she were part of a dream. Or an angel's nightmare.<P>&#34;But you know,&#34; Kaia added, &#34;stealing Boone's Farm in town doesn't help me now. I'm only partially buzzed and was hoping to be totally and completely smashed by the time the sun set.&#34;<P>&#34;You should be thanking me, then. You got smashed last night. And the night before. And the night before that.&#34;<P>Kaia shrugged. &#34;So?&#34;<P>&#34;So, your life is in a rut. You steal liquor, climb a mountain while drinking and dive off when drunk.&#34;<P>&#34;Well, then yours is in a rut, too, since you've been with me each of those nights.&#34; The redhead frowned. &#34;Still. Maybe you're right. Maybe we need a change.&#34; She gazed around the majestic summit. &#34;So what new and exciting thing do you want to do now?&#34;<P>&#34;Complain. Can you believe Gwennie is getting married?&#34; Bianka asked. &#34;And to Sabin, keeper of the demon of Doubt, of all people. Or demons. Whatever.&#34;<P>Gwennie. Gwendolyn. Their youngest sister.<P>&#34;I know. It's weird.&#34; A still-frowning Kaia eased down beside her. &#34;Would you rather be a bridesmaid or be hit by a bus?&#34;<P>&#34;The bus. No question. That, I'd recover from.&#34;<P>&#34;Agreed.&#34;<P>Bianka did not like weddings? Odd. Most females <i>craved </i>them. Still. <i>No need for the bus, </i>Lysander wanted to tell her. <i>You will not be attending your sister's wedding.</i><P>&#34;So which of us will be her maid of honor, do you think?&#34; Kaia asked.<P>&#34;Not it,&#34; Bianka said, just as Kaia opened her mouth to say the same.<P>&#34;Damn it!&#34;<P>Bianka laughed with genuine amusement. &#34;Your duties shouldn't be too bad. Gwennie's the nicest of the Skyhawks, after all.&#34;<P>&#34;Nice when she's not protecting Sabin, that is.&#34; Kaia shuddered. &#34;I swear, threaten the man with a little bodily harm, and she's ready to claw your eyes out.&#34;<P>&#34;Think we'll ever fall in love like that?&#34; As curious as Bianka sounded, there was also a hint of sadness in her voice.<P>Why sadness? Did she want to fall in love? Or was she thinking of a particular man she yearned for? Lysander had not yet seen her interact with a male she desired.<P>Kaia waved a deceptively delicate hand through the air. &#34;We've been alive for centuries without falling. Clearly, it's just not meant to be. But I, for one, am glad about that. Men become a liability when you try and make them permanent.&#34;<P>&#34;Yeah,&#34; was the reply. &#34;But a fun liability.&#34;<P>&#34;True. And I haven't had fun in a long time,&#34; Kaia said with a pout.<P>&#34;Me, either. Except with myself, but I don't suppose that counts.&#34;<P>&#34;It does the way I do it.&#34;<P>They shared another laugh.<P>Fun. Sex, Lysander realized, now having no trouble keeping up with their conversation. They were discussing sex. Something he'd never tried. Not even with himself.<P>He'd never wanted to try, either. Still didn't. Not even with Bianka and her amazing (soft?) skin.<P>As long as he'd been alive&mdash;a span of time far greater than their few hundred years&mdash;he'd seen many humans caught up in the act. It looked&hellip;messy. As un-fun as something could be. Yet humans betrayed their friends and family to do it. They even willingly, happily gave up hard-earned money in exchange for it. When not taking part themselves, they became obsessed with it, watching others do it on a television or computer screen.<P>&#34;We should have nailed one of the Lords when we were in Buda,&#34; Kaia said thoughtfully. &#34;Paris is hawt.&#34;<P>She could only be referring to the Lords of the Underworld. Immortal warriors possessed by the demons once locked inside Pandora's box. As Lysander had observed them throughout the centuries, ensuring they obeyed heavenly laws&mdash;since their demons had escaped hell before those laws were enacted, no one having thought escape possible, they had not been killed but thrust into that box first, and the Lords second&mdash;he knew that Paris was host to Promiscuity, forced to bed a new person every day or weaken and die.<P>&#34;Paris is hot, yes, but I liked Amun.&#34; Bianka stretched to her back, mist again whipping around her. &#34;He doesn't speak, which makes him the perfect man in my opinion.&#34;<P>Amun, the host of the demon of Secrets. So. Bianka liked him, did she? Lysander pictured the warrior. Tall, though Lysander was taller. Muscled, though Lysander was more so. Dark where Lysander was light. He was actually relieved to know the Harpy preferred a different type of male than himself.<P>That wouldn't change her fate, but it did lessen Lysander's burden. He hadn't been sure what he would have done if she'd <i>asked </i>him to touch her. That she wouldn't was most definitely a relief.<P>&#34;What about Aeron?&#34; Kaia asked. &#34;All those tattoos&hellip;&#34; A moan slipped from her as she shivered. &#34;I could trace every single one of them with my tongue.&#34;<P>Aeron, host of Wrath. One of only two Lords with wings, Aeron's were black and gossamer. He had tattoos all over his body, and looked every inch the demon he was. What's more, he had recently broken a spiritual covenant. Therefore, Aeron would be dead before the upcoming nuptials.<P>Lysander's charge, Olivia, had been ordered to slay the warrior. So far she had resisted the decree. The girl was too softhearted for her own good. Eventually, though, she would do her duty. Otherwise, she would be kicked to earth, immortal no longer, and that was not a fate Lysander would allow.<P>Of all the angels he'd trained, she was by far his favorite. As gentle as she was, a man couldn't help but want to make her happy. She was trustworthy, loyal and all that was pure; she was the type of female who should have tempted him. A female he might have been able to accept in a romantic way. Wild Bianka&hellip; no. Never.<P>&#34;However will I choose between my two favorite Lords, B?&#34; Another sigh returned Lysander's focus to the Harpies.<P>Bianka rolled her eyes. &#34;Just sample them both. Not like you haven't enjoyed a twofer before.&#34;<P>Kaia laughed, though the amusement didn't quite reach her voice. Like Bianka, there was a twinge of sadness to the sound. &#34;True.&#34;<P>Lysander's mouth curled in mild distaste. Two different partners in one day. Or at the same time. Had Bianka done that, too? Probably.<P>&#34;What about you?&#34; Kaia asked. &#34;You gonna hook up with Amun at the wedding?&#34;<P>There was a long, heavy pause. Then Bianka shrugged. &#34;Maybe. Probably.&#34;<P>He should leave and return when she was alone. The more he learned about her, the more he disliked her. Soon he would simply snatch her up, no matter who watched, revealing his presence, his intentions, just to save this world from her dark influence.<P>He flapped his wings once, twice, lifting into the air.<P>&#34;You know what I want more than anything else in the world?&#34; she asked, rolling to her side and facing her sister. Facing Lysander directly, as well. Her eyes were wide, amber irises luminous. Beams of sunlight seemed to soak into that glorious skin, and he found himself pausing.<P>Kaia stretched out beside her. &#34;To co-host <i>Good Morning America?&#34;</i><P>&#34;Well, yeah, but that's not what I meant.&#34;<P>&#34;Then I'm stumped.&#34;<P>&#34;Well&hellip;&#34; Bianka nibbled on her bottom lip. Opened her mouth. Closed her mouth. Scowled. &#34;I'll tell you, but you can't tell anyone.&#34;<P>The redhead pretended to twist a lock over her lips.<P>&#34;I'm serious, K. Tell anyone, and I'll deny it then hunt you down and chop off your head.&#34;<P>Would she truly? Lysander wondered. Again, probably. He could not imagine hurting his Olivia, whom he loved like a sister. Maybe because she was not one of the Elite Seven, but was a joy-bringer, the weakest of the angels.<P>There were three angelic factions. The Elite Seven, the warriors and the joy-bringers. Their status was reflected in both their different duties and the color of their wings. Each of the Seven possessed golden wings, like his own. Warriors possessed white wings merely threaded with gold, and the joy-bringers' white wings bore no gold at all.<P>Olivia had been a joy-bringer all the centuries of her existence. Something she was quite happy with. That was why everyone, including Olivia, had experienced such shock when golden down had begun to grow in her feathers.<P>Not Lysander, however. He'd petitioned the Angelic Council, and they'd agreed. It had needed to be done. She was too fascinated by the demon-possessed warrior Aeron. Too&hellip; infatuated. Ridding her of such an attraction was imperative. As he well knew.<P>His hand clenched into a fist. He blamed himself for Olivia's circumstances. He had sent her to watch the Lords. To study them. He should have gone himself, but he'd hoped to avoid Bianka.<P>&#34;Well, don't just lie there. Tell me what you want to do more than anything else in the world,&#34; Kaia exclaimed, once again drawing his attention.<P>Bianka uttered another sigh. &#34;I want to sleep with a man.&#34;<P>Kaia's brow scrunched in confusion. &#34;Uh, hello. Wasn't that what we were just discussing?&#34;<P>&#34;No, dummy. I mean, I want to sleep. As in, conk out. As in, snore my ass off.&#34;<P>A moment passed in silence as Kaia absorbed the announcement. &#34;What! That's forbidden. Stupid. Dangerous.&#34;<P>Harpies lived by two rules, he knew. They could only eat what they stole or earned, and they could not sleep in the presence of another. The first was because of a curse on all Harpy-kind, and the second because Harpies were suspicious and untrusting by nature.<P>Lysander's head tilted to the side as he found himself imagining holding Bianka in his arms as she drifted into slumber. That fall of dark curls would tumble over his arm and chest. Her warmth would seep into his body. Her leg would rub over his.<P>He could never allow it, of course, but that didn't diminish the power of the vision. To hold her, protect her, comfort her would be&hellip; nice.<P>Would her skin be as soft as it appeared?<P>His teeth ground together. There was that ridiculous question again. <i>I do not care. It does not matter.</i><P>&#34;Forget I said anything,&#34; Bianka grumbled, once more flopping to her back and staring up at the bright sky.<br>
