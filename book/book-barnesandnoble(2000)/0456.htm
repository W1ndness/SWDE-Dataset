God created us for a reason, and when we come to recognize our deepest longing, we can discover His plan for our lives. Full of encouragement and divine empowerment for women, the book centers around the Bible's assurance that God knits each one of us together in our mother's womb. Debbie deftly weaves her own story, using the knitting theme of her most recent bestsellers to create metaphors that explore God's handiwork in creating us for a purpose.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Bestselling novelist Macomber ventures into nonfiction as she encourages Christian women of faith to knit themselves into God's purpose for their lives. Just as many of her novels (<I>A Good Yarn</I>; <I>The Shop on Blossom Street</I>) feature knitting and characters who knit, this narrative nonfiction employs knitting as a metaphor for a creative, persistent and visionary spiritual journey. Fans will appreciate Macomber's lively, positive outlook and the behind-the-scenes look at her personal highs and lows. Macomber joyfully recounts the often arduous road to success, interspersing these difficulties with faith issues such as dreams, risks, success, balance, relationships, work, laughter, gratitude, blessing and worship. Within each chapter, she draws upon Psalm 139 and unequivocally assures readers that God has created every person with a worthy purpose, a dream to be followed and happily realized. Practical as well as inspirational, the guide debunks common misconceptions that hinder dream actualization ("Lie number one: It's who you know. Lie number two: I'm too old. Lie number three: It's too hard"). Macomber's work is both cheerful and cheering, and both faithful fans and newcomers will resonate strongly with her delightful message. <I>(Aug. 21)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information

When Macomber decided to follow her dreams of becoming a bestselling novelist, she had a lot of obstacles in her path. For starters, Macomber is dyslexic. On top of this, she had only a high school degree, four young children at home, and absolutely no connections in the publishing world. If there's one thing you can say about Debbie Macomber, however, it is that she does not give up. She rented a typewriter and started writing, determined to break into the world of romance fiction.   <P>The years went on and the rejection letters piled up. Her family was living on a shoestring budget, and Debbie was beginning to think that her dreams of being a novelist might never be fulfilled. She began writing for magazines to earn some extra money, and she eventually saved up enough to attend a romance writer's conference with three hundred other aspiring novelists. The organizers of the conference picked ten manuscripts to review in a group critique session. Debbie was thrilled to learn that her manuscript would be one of the novels discussed.   <P>Her excitement quickly faded when an editor from Harlequin tore her manuscript to pieces in front of the crowded room, evoking peals of laughter from the assembled writers. Afterwards, Macomber approached the editor and asked her what she could do to improve her novel. "Throw it away," the editor suggested.   <P>Many writers would have given up right then and there, but not Macomber. The deeply religious Macomber took a lesson from Job and gathered strength from adversity. She returned home and mailed one last manuscript to Silhouette, a publisher of romance novels. "It cost $10 to mail it off," Macomber told the <I>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</I> in 2000. "My husband was out of work at this time, in Alaska, trying to find a job. The children and I were living on his $250-a-week unemployment, and I can't tell you what $10 was to us at that time."   <P>It turned out to be the best $10 Macomber ever spent. In 1984, Silhouette published her novel, <I>Heartsong</I>. (Incidentally, although <I>Heartsong</I>  was Macomber's first sale, she actually published another book, <I>Starlight</I>, before <I>Heartsong</I> went to print.) <I>Heartsong</I> went on to become the first romance novel to ever be reviewed in <I>Publishers Weekly</I>, and Macomber was finally on her way.  <P>Today, Macomber is one of the most widely read authors in America. A regular on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller charts,  she is best known for her Cedar Cove novels, a heartwarming story sequence set in a small town in Washington state, and for her Knitting Books series, featuring a group of women who patronize a Seattle yarn store. In addition, her backlist of early romances, including several contemporary Westerns, has been reissued with great success.  <P>Macomber has made a successful transition from conventional romance to the somewhat more flexible genre known as "women's fiction." "I was at a point in my life where I found it difficult to identify with a 25-year-old heroine," Macomber said in an interview with ContemporaryRomanceWriters.com. "I found that I wanted to write more about the friendships women share with each other." To judge from her avid, ever-increasing fan base, Debbie's readers heartily approve.</P></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some outtakes from our interview with Macomber:</I> <p>  <b>"I'm dyslexic, although they didn't have a word for it</b> when I was in grade school. The teachers said I had 'word blindness.' I've always been a creative speller and never achieved good grades in school. I graduated from high school but didn't have the opportunity to attend college, so I did what young women my age did at the time -- I married. I was a teenager, and Wayne and I (now married nearly 37 years) had four children in five years."<p>    <b>"I'm a yarnaholic. That means I have more yarn stashed away</b> than any one person could possibly use in three or four lifetimes. There's something inspiring about yarn that makes me feel I could never have enough. Often I'll go into my yarn room (yes, room!) and just hold skeins of yarn and dream about projects. It's a comforting thing to do."<p>    <b>"My office walls are covered with autographs of famous writers</b> -- it's what my children call my �dead author wall.' I have signatures from Mark Twain, Earnest Hemingway, Jack London, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Pearl Buck, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, to name a few."  <p>     <b>"I'm morning person, and rip into the day with a half-mile swim</b> (FYI: a half mile is a whole lot farther in the water than it is on land) at the local pool before I head into the office, arriving before eight. It takes me until nine or ten to read through all of the guest book entries from my web site and the mail before I go upstairs to the turret where I do my writing. Yes, I write in a turret -- is that romantic, or what? I started blogging last September and really enjoy sharing bits and pieces of my life with my readers. Once I'm home for the day, I cook dinner, trying out new recipes. Along with cooking, I also enjoy eating, especially when the meal is accompanied by a glass of good wine. Wayne and I take particular pleasure in sampling eastern Washington State wines (since we were both born and raised in that part of the state). <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the spring of 2005, Debbie Macomber took some time out to answer our questions.</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  The one book that has had the strongest influence on my life, without question, is the Bible. God's Word has been the guiding force behind all I do. I read the Bible each and every day and gain inspiration, encouragement, and joy.  <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  Before I answer this, I feel it's necessary to mention that I read widely, across the board.  In compiling this list I discovered several of my favorite books are nonfiction. I have not noted the Bible a second time, although as I indicated above, it is the most influential book in my life. <p>    <li><I>Charms for the Easy Life</I> by Kaye Gibbons -- For its charm, its wonderful writing, and its truth. (I introduced this book to my editor, who now loves Kaye Gibbons's work as much as I do.) <p>    <li><I>And Then There Was Light</I> by Jacques Lusseyran -- I read this book shortly after learning that my father had been a POW in WWII, something he never talked about until the end of his life. It helped me understand some of what he endured and gave me a deep appreciation of the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation. <p>    <li><I>The Power of Positive Thinking</I> by Norman Vincent Peale -- When I first decided to write, I knew I was going to need all the positive reinforcement I could get. I read and reread Dr. Peale's wonderful words of wisdom. After I published my first book, I wrote Dr. Peale to thank him for his inspiration, and he wrote me back. It is a letter I will always treasure. <p>    <li><I>The Wolf and the Dove</I> by Kathleen E.  Woodiwiss -- I loved and read this historical romance so often that I had the first page nearly memorized. Kathleen Woodiwiss opened my eyes to the possibilities of fiction. These characters felt real to me. I cheered and cried with them and never wanted the book to end. I first read this book in the early 1980s and knew from that moment on that I wanted my readers to feel the same way when they finished one of my books.   <p>    <li><I>Why Good Girls Don't Get Ahead but Gutsy Girls Do</I> by Kate White -- This business-related book taught me that I'm a gutsy girl in a good-girl disguise. It offers some of the soundest career advice I've read. <p>    <li><I>The 21 Immutable Laws of Marketing</I> by Al Ries and Jack Trout -- Another wonderful business book that is  full of interesting tidbits about the buying public, their buying habits and how best to market to them. <p>    <li><I>The Notorious Rake</I> by Mary Balogh -- I'm a real fan of Regency romances, and I consider this one of the best.  I read this book in one sitting, unable to put it down. <p>    <li><I>The 13th Juror</I> by John Lescroart -- This is one of the best-plotted and most interesting books I've read in ages, and I have recommended it again and again. John is a wonderful writer, and we discovered that we have a great deal in common, including the fact that both our fathers were POWs in WWII. <p>    <li><I>If Ever I Return, Pretty Peggy-O</I> by Sharyn McCrumb -- My editor recommended this author to me and commented that she envied me the experience of reading my first Sharyn McCrumb. (This book is the first of her Ballad series, all set in Appalachia.) Later I was fortunate enough to meet Sharyn at a writers' conference, so I could tell her how much I enjoyed her work. <p>    <li><I>Walking After Midnight</I> by Karen Robards -- This book was pure fun. I felt as though I was on a roller-coaster ride, and every page was a thrill.  <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  I'm a big film buff, although I'm not fond of movies with excessive violence. I've always enjoyed musicals. My first exposure was with <I>West Side Story</I>. I memorized all the songs and belted them out for months afterward. I almost entered the convent after watching <I>The Sound of Music</I>. Thankfully, I didn't; it wouldn't have been a good fit for either of us. In recent years I've enjoyed <I>The Princess Bride</I> and the <I>Star Wars</I> series. I like movies with what I call a zinger -- <I>Collateral</I> and <i>The Replacement Killers</I> are good examples. And comedies, too.  I don't think I've ever laughed so hard as when I watched <I>The Gods Must Be Crazy</I>, <I>It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World</I>, and <I>The Hallelujah Trail</I>. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I don't listen to music while writing. It's not that I need silence in order to create. I started out writing when our four children were small and I needed to keep my ears tuned to them in case one of them decided to play Superman and fly out a window or start a campfire in the middle of the living room. When it comes to listening to the radio, I prefer the oldies stations. When I'm on the treadmill, I play Christian CDs and make a joyful noise. Correction: It's a joyful noise to me, but I doubt others would think so.  <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  There's a bookstore directly below my office. It's hard to believe but I write above a bookstore <I>and</I> an ice cream parlor. This, my friends, is a writer's nirvana. On average I buy a book a day, and that's no exaggeration. Mostly I purchase nonfiction for gifts. One of my favorites is <I>Gifts from the Sea</I> by Anne Morrow Lindberg. For my writer friends I've bought <I>Goals</I> by Brian Tracy, and for friends who are animal lovers I've bought <I>The Dog Who Rescues Cats</I> by Gonzalez & Fleischer. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have a cherrywood desk with a glass top to protect the wood. Over the years a number of things have made their way under the glass. There's a picture of my dad and his brother, who looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for identical twins -- only my dad was a full foot shorter than his brother. Then there are pictures of my grandchildren (by far the cutest grandkids in the universe), and there's a slip of paper on which I've written four words. They are:  "provocative," "relevant," "creative," and "honest." When I decide on a plot for one of my big hardcover stories, I weigh the story against each of these words. I want to provoke my readers to think. I want the story to be relevant to them and to our times. My goal is to tell this story in as creative a way as possible and to be honest with my readers and with myself. As you might have guessed, I'm a lover of words. As for rituals, I really don't have any.  <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  In my humble opinion, there are a lot of writers out there who haven't suffered enough. I suffered plenty. When I first started writing, I didn't know another writer in the world. This was back in the late 1970s before Romance Writers of America was formed. For nearly five years I wrote and submitted my manuscripts. My work was rejected so fast it practically hit me in the back of the head on my way home from the post office. At one point in my lonely sojourn, an editor read and reviewed my manuscript, and with the utmost sincerity told me there was no use in revising it and the best thing I could do was <I>throw it away</I>. Thankfully, I didn't take her advice, because that <I>same</I> manuscript sold to a rival publishing house and launched my writing career. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I would suggest that writers pay close attention to the market -- read the bestsellers, analyze each story and look for the key element that is drawing an audience. Who would ever have imagined that <I>Life of Pi</I> by Yann Martel would command the audience it has? Or <I>The Da Vinci Code</I>? As writers, it's important we not <I>follow</I> trends but observe and understand life -- and start our own. It was when I saw a lot of angel figurines turning up in catalogs that I wrote the first Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy Christmas book.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>Debbie Macomber calls KNIT TOGETHER the project of her heart.Whenever she speaks, her theme is simple&#58; don't be afraid to dream. God created us for a reason, and when we come to recognize our deepest longing, we can discover His plan for our lives. Full of encouragement and divine empowerment for women, the book centers around the Bible's assurance that God knits each one of us together in our mother's womb. Debbie deftly weaves her own story, using the knitting theme of her most recent bestsellers to create metaphors that explore God's handiwork in creating us for a purpose.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Bestselling novelist Macomber ventures into nonfiction as she encourages Christian women of faith to knit themselves into God's purpose for their lives. Just as many of her novels (<I>A Good Yarn</I>; <I>The Shop on Blossom Street</I>) feature knitting and characters who knit, this narrative nonfiction employs knitting as a metaphor for a creative, persistent and visionary spiritual journey. Fans will appreciate Macomber's lively, positive outlook and the behind-the-scenes look at her personal highs and lows. Macomber joyfully recounts the often arduous road to success, interspersing these difficulties with faith issues such as dreams, risks, success, balance, relationships, work, laughter, gratitude, blessing and worship. Within each chapter, she draws upon Psalm 139 and unequivocally assures readers that God has created every person with a worthy purpose, a dream to be followed and happily realized. Practical as well as inspirational, the guide debunks common misconceptions that hinder dream actualization ("Lie number one: It's who you know. Lie number two: I'm too old. Lie number three: It's too hard"). Macomber's work is both cheerful and cheering, and both faithful fans and newcomers will resonate strongly with her delightful message. <I>(Aug. 21)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information

It is not attained through self-gratification,  but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.  Helen Keller  <p>  <p>  Before you were born, before you knew the world and the world knew  you, there was only One, the Creator, who knew you in your most  basic form. Even then, He had a relationship with you. Growing  within the quiet shadows of your mother's womb, blocked from even  her eyes, God watched you, marveling as your fingernails formed, and  your eyelashes fluttered, and the tiny corners of your mouth turned  up in pleasure as you discovered your miniature thumb for the very  first time. You were His design, His pattern, and you were beautiful  to Him.  <p>  From the moment each of us is created, God has a purpose for us. We  don't necessarily know what it looks like at first, but we can be  sure it's there, somewhere inside us. For a long time, I wondered  what my purpose was. I knew I loved being a mother, and I knew I  loved writing' but a writing career seemed to be something achievable  only in my dreams, certainly not in real life for a  twenty-nine-year-old housewife and mother of four.  <p>  When Ithink about what it means to be created by God for a purpose,  my thoughts turn to Psalm 139. It is one of my favorite passages of  the Bible because it combines two of my favorite things' knitting and  the understanding of God's call on my life. We were knit together in  our mothers' wombs (Psalm 139:13). We have been searched and known  by the greatest designer in the universe (Psalm 139:1). We were  designed for something special. I believe that something special is  reflected in the strong desires God puts in our hearts through our  dreams, through our passions, and through the things that bring us  joy. It's through those things that we can discover what our purpose  is, when we see for ourselves the pattern He's made for us and the  dreams He's knitted together for us to live out.  <p>  I hope you'll go on an amazing adventure with me as we examine Psalm  139 in depth and discover the pattern God has for each of us when it  comes to our purpose, our achievements, and so many other pieces  that make up this fitted and well-worn garment we call life.  <p>  <p>  <b>Finding Purpose in Humble Beginnings</b>  <p>  Twenty-five years ago, I could not have imagined myself writing a  book about realizing your dreams. I'm sure no one else could have  imagined my writing one, either! I come from humble beginnings. I'm  incredibly proud of my heritage and consider myself blessed in a  number of ways because of my family. All four of my grandparents  were German-speaking Russian immigrants. My father didn't graduate  from high school and while my mother did, she had to move off the  farm into town and work in order to obtain her education. Both of my  grandfathers pushed a plow. There's absolutely nothing in my  background that qualifies me to be a writer.  <p>  I got married out of high school to Wayne Macomber, and between 1970  and 1975 we had four children. I remember what my mother told me  shortly after Dale, our youngest, was born. I hadn't slept an entire  night in months; I was physically and mentally worn to a frazzle. A  look of such joy came over my mother as she watched me with our  newborn son. She smiled and said, 'Debbie, these will be the  happiest days of your life.' I stared back at her in utter horror.  'Mom, you mean to tell me it gets worse'. She laughed, promising me  that one day I would treasure these days with my little ones. And  she was right.  <p>  So I was the mom of four youngsters living on a limited income with  nothing more than a high school degree, and on top of that, I'm  dyslexic. School was always difficult for me, and I never managed to  achieve anything higher than average grades. A scholarship or the  possibility of college was never an option. At the time I didn't  know I was dyslexic. The teachers didn't have a word for it then. I  didn't know my troubles in school stemmed from a learning disability  until my own children were diagnosed with dyslexia many years later.  Dyslexia doesn't go away, so to this very day I'm a slow, thoughtful  reader and a creative speller.  <p>  As a child of the fifties growing up in Yakima, Washington, words  were both my passion and my torment. My mom said that from the time  I was four years old, I went to sleep every night with a book in my  hands. I loved visiting the local library where Beverly Bunn, the  children's librarian, would read to us for story hour. She later  married and went on to write novels, too. You may have read her  work. Her married name is Beverly Cleary. I didn't know it at the  time, but she had problems reading as a kid, too.  <p>  Despite my love for stories and for reading, I struggled in school.  I was the only girl in my first-grade class to be in the Robin  Reading Group, the lowest level there was. I can still remember  sitting with my mother for a parent-teacher conference with my  third-grade teacher. 'Debbie is such a nice little girl, but she'll  never do well in school,' my mother was told. Whether it was a  self-fulfilling prophecy, I don't know, but the teacher was right' I  never did achieve high grades and remained an average student, so  average, in fact, that academically I ranked fortieth in my  graduating class of eighty girls.  <p>  The biggest complaint teachers had about me growing up was that I  daydreamed. It was true. As early as I can remember, I liked  creating stories, often when I was supposed to be paying attention  in class. Storytelling actually became my niche when I was twelve or  thirteen. I used to make up stories about the kids I babysat,  entertaining them with silly names like Snickelfritz and Stinkyfoot,  and they loved it' so much that their parents would pay me a dollar  an hour when the going rate was just a quarter. A friend of mine  likes to joke that even then, I was set on being successful! Maybe I  was, but I certainly didn't know it.  <p>  Though reading was difficult, I persisted with it, and by the time I  was in fifth grade, I had caught up with my classmates. I was ten  when I started thinking about what it would be like to be a writer,  and I wrote my first book the following year. I still remember the  characters' the story was about triplets named Faith, Hope, and  Charity, a precursor I'm sure to what have become my three  angels' Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy' favorite characters of several  Christmas books I've written over the years. I never told my  teachers or friends I wanted to write because I was afraid they  would tell me all the reasons it was impossible for me to be a  writer. I didn't get good grades in English (or anything else), and  my spelling was atrocious. I couldn't bear to have such a fragile  dream trampled upon.  <p>  <p>  <b>Finding <i>Your</i> Purpose</b>  <p>  I am absolutely convinced that each of us is created with a  God-given purpose. It's what I like to call the focus of our  lives' the 'what' that my life, and yours, is all about. Some people  seem to know what their purpose is early on; they get up every  morning with this innate passion for something; they walk around  with fire in their bellies' a desire that doesn't go away. They have  vision and determination, and they are ready to see all their dreams  come true! For others, though, their purpose, their life's focus,  seems much dimmer, harder to see. But that doesn't mean it isn't  there.  <p>  If you've picked up this book, chances are you're trying to figure  out what your purpose is or how to achieve that seemingly  unreachable dream. Maybe you thought you knew what you wanted to do,  but life's circumstances have left you wondering. Maybe you've never  known. Or perhaps you do know, but, as I was, you're afraid. You're  scared of what other people will think, or you fear that you'll  fail. So you stick your purpose up on a shelf, thinking that maybe  someday you'll get to it.  <p>  In the late seventies, my purpose, my focus to be a writer, was way,  way out of reach and coated with a thick layer of dusty childhood  doubts and the busyness of being a mother to four very active  children. But every once in a while, in my mind, I'd take my purpose  down and look at it, turn it around and wistfully think, <i>Maybe after  the kids are grown.</i> Then, back on the shelf it went. Out of sight,  out of mind. Almost. Until David got sick.  <p>  My cousin David Adler and I grew up together. We attended the same  schools, lived in the same neighborhood, and worshipped at the same  church. The only dates I got in high school were due to David. In  fact, it was David, another cousin, Doug, and my brother Terry who  made copies of my eighth-grade diary and sold them to the boys in my  class. At the time, I was mortified, but the years have a way of  changing one's perspective. These days, what I remember most is how  many copies were bought!  <p>  As a young adult, David was diagnosed with leukemia. When he was  admitted to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, my  husband, Wayne, and I were the closest family to the hospital,  living just a few miles south of town. Although I didn't venture  into the big city very often, I was determined to be with David, his  wife, Rachel, and their daughter. From the day he arrived in Seattle  from Yakima, I spent part of every day with my cousin. I was certain  God would perform a miracle. I was convinced that God would heal  him.  <p>  At the time, I hadn't been a Christian long. I was raised Catholic  and attended the local parochial school for all twelve grades. In my  parents' house there had always been a coffee-table Bible, but I  never saw it open. Every Sunday when I went to Mass, I heard the  four Gospels and the Epistles, but they never connected. Maybe I was  too young to really care back then. I knew about God, but the God I  grew up with was stern and vengeful. I didn't have a relationship  with Him. I didn't know Him. I didn't realize Christ was my personal  Savior; I knew only that my sins had nailed Him to the cross.  <p>  But at the age of twenty-two, after Wayne and I had married and I  was a mother twice over, we moved to Seahurst, near Seattle. With  two small babies born a year apart on my hips, I was invited to  Bible Study Fellowship (BSF) by my neighbor Marilyn Kimmel. Until  that point I'd never set foot inside a Protestant church, but I was  hungry for friendship and so I went. I had the most uncomfortable  feeling as soon as I got there. I was afraid if my parents ever  found out what I was doing, they'd be upset. Then the teaching  leader, Denise Adler, introduced herself. Adler is my maiden name,  and it was as if God was saying to me that it was fine for me to be  in these unfamiliar surroundings; I was home and this was family.  <p>  That week the class was studying the first four chapters of  Nehemiah. I remember Marilyn telling me somewhat apologetically that  this was the year BSF was studying the Minor Prophets. I told myself  that was okay since I didn't know what a major one was. Surrounded  by those dear ladies, as I got into the Word, it latched onto my  heart. It wasn't long before I felt God tugging at me. I wanted the  same relationship with Christ that my friends had. As I studied His  Word, I surrendered my life to Jesus Christ and have never regretted  that decision.  <p>  <p>  <b>Knit Together for Purpose</b>  <p>  'Whether I am knitting for myself or someone else, my passion for  knitting enables me to express my creativity and produces a feeling  of accomplishment.'  'Rita E. Greenfeder, Editor, <i>Knit 'N Style</i>  <p>  If you've ever read any of my books, you probably already know that  I'm a big knitter. I started knitting as a twelve-year-old girl. My  mother wasn't a knitter, and in fact, I didn't know a single person  who knew how to knit. I pestered her until she took me to the local  yarn store. The wonderful ladies there took me under their wing and  taught me, and I've never been the same since. I knitted all through  my school years until Wayne and I married, and then again  periodically while the kids were growing up. But it was when I  became a grandmother for the first time that the bug really took  hold. I love to knit! I also love collecting yarn. In fact, I need  an entire room to hold my yarn stash. It's difficult for me to  resist stopping in a yarn store, no matter how many projects are  already waiting for me at home. But knitting can often be a slow  process. From start to finish, it takes time to complete. Knitting  certainly requires patience and persistence. I find it's the same  with finding your purpose.  <p>  That's why, seven years later, because of that wonderful  relationship I had with Jesus, I was absolutely convinced that God  would heal my cousin David. After all, I knew my life had changed  for the better, and I knew God could make a difference in David's  life. And this was no mustard-seed faith; the faith I carried around  was the size of avocados! I told David, 'God is going to heal you.  Through the love of Jesus Christ, you're going to be healed.'  <p>  But despite all my prayers and absolute certainty, David passed away  on September 23, 1978. And suddenly, I didn't know what to believe.  I was in a crisis of faith. I couldn't sleep; I couldn't pray. I  couldn't read my Bible. I felt that God had let me down.  <p>  My questions ended one morning, though, when I tried to have  devotions with the children. My son Ted was particularly antsy that  day, and, exasperated, I tried again to get him to pay attention.  <p>  'Ted,' I asked, for the twentieth time, 'what do you have to do to  get to heaven.'  <p>  He looked at me as if I had just asked what he'd had for breakfast.  <p>  'Die,' he said.  <p>  His answer took a moment to sink in. But I realized he was right.  David had died, but before his death he had come to know the same  Jesus I did. Because he had accepted Christ, I had the assurance  that David was in heaven. Furthermore, by the grace of God, David  really had been healed.  <p>  That revelation was quickly followed by another: I could no longer  afford to dream of being a writer <i>someday</i>. I could no longer stuff  my dreams into the future with a long list of justifications. Life  holds no guarantees. I realized then that it was time for me to move  my life purpose forward. It was time to go after my dream.  <p>  Since we didn't have the money to buy a typewriter, we rented one. I  placed that typewriter on the kitchen table and moved it at  mealtimes. Every morning when the kids left for school, I moved the  typewriter back to the table and wrote until they came home. I  didn't have a lot of life experience at that point, but I knew I  could write something with a happy ending. And after four kids, I  needed one.  <p>  <p>  <b>The Passion in Your Purpose</b> <p>  I imagine that you're asking how I knew my purpose was to be a  writer. Well, I didn't at first, not completely. But as I said  earlier, I believe that God puts desires in our hearts through our  dreams, through our passions, and through what brings us joy. When  we can look through all of those things, we can find our purpose as  we discover the customized blueprint, the pattern, God's made for  each of us.  <p>  So, let's take a look at the passion in our purpose. Ask yourself  these questions: <i>What is it that gets me excited' What do I love to  do'</i>  <p>  I believe that what you enjoyed as a child often provides hints of  what you should be doing as an adult. When I was young, I loved to  read and tell stories. Maybe you loved to dress up your dolls,  creating elaborate new fashions. Maybe you liked drawing. Or maybe  you thrived on helping other people, or taking care of the  neighbor's dog. Perhaps you enjoyed playing school or house, or  caring for sick stuffed animals. Whatever you enjoyed most can give  you clues to the purpose God has for you. As Rick Warren puts it so  directly on the first page of <i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i>, 'It's not  about you.'  <p>  God has a plan for your life and a purpose that fits into His master  plan. But He doesn't want you to float through life waiting for a  giant bolt of lightning to fall from heaven and point out what  you're supposed to be doing. He gave each of us a brain as well as a  heart. We have to listen to both to truly discover the pattern God  has for our lives.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Knit Together</b> by <b>Debbie Macomber</b>  Copyright &copy 2007   by Debbie Macomber, Inc..
