											Gena knows how to write MEN!!! HOT, tormented MEN!!! And the beautiful, feisty ladies they fall head-over-heals for. This series contains everything that consumes the immortal warriors: Violence, Death, Wrath, Passion, Pain, Disease and 6 more hotties. Not to mention it's also filled with: Passion, Heat, Humor, Bantering, Love and Great Sex. This is the order I believe the 8 books are in so far...with more to come...<p/><p/>The Darkest Fire (Prequel - part of Into The Dark)<p/>The Darkest Night<p/>The Darkest Kiss<p/>The Darkest Pleasure<p/>The Darkest Whisper<p/>The Darkest Lie<p/>The Darkest Prison (Bonus story - part of Into The Dark)<p/>The Darkest Passion</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Liked it, loved it, I want some more of it!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Kloee">Kloee</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1395329_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780373775224_BK_1_1395329" href="#previewReview_1395329" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 25, 2010: 
											Although this is the 2nd book in a series of 11 so far, I was able to immediately fall into the storyline and connect with the characters; Ashlyn Darrow and Madoxx.  <p/><p/>Madoxx was created a warrior meant to guard the king of gods.  When the god did not think him strong enough to guard his most precious possession, a box formed from the bones of the dead goddess of oppression; instead the god commanded a woman, Pandora, to do it.  Knowing the woman chosen was considered the greatest woman warrior did not help the stinging of his pride.  To prove this choice a mistake, Madoxx helped release the demons inside upon the world; as punishment, he was bonded to one.  Afterwards, the demon had compelled him to kill her, the guardian it hated above all else.  To pay for his actions, he is forced to take Pandora's place by experiencing her death each night.  <p/><p/>Ashlyn only had to stand in one location to hear every conversation that had ever taken place there, no matter how much time had passed.  Present, past, any and all languages; in her mind she could translate them.  Her job utilizes this skill to listen and learn for the Institute and her boss, Dr. McIntosh.  While visiting Budapest, for the Institute, she learns about men rumored to be angels that live in a ch&amp;#226;teau up on a hill.  Desperate to silence the voices, she decides to search for these men and ask for the help.  <p/><p/>Unknown to her, she was being watched by the men and believed to be part of the 'hunters,' whom appear to be following her up the hill.  Madoxx approaches Ashlyn after killing the other 'hunters' and suspects her of being 'bait.' (Meant to lure the demons out for capture and destruction)<p/><p/>Started looking for the other books within the series...can't wait to read about the other warriors.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/44150000/44153914.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Gena Showalter</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>School of Hard Knocks</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.genashowalter.com">* Gena Showalter's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Gena Showalter is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of Paranormal Romance, Contemporary Romance, and Young Adult novels from a multitude of publishers.

She is a self proclaimed coffee addict and when she's not writing she likes to...well, we're not sure.  We've never seen her do anything but write.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>In the fall of 2009, Gena Showalter took some time to talk with us about her favorite books, authors, and interests.</i><br><br>  <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>  <i>Warrior's Woman</i> by Johanna Lindsey.  Before this book, I had only ever read historical romances.  But I was intrigued by the idea of a futuristic society, spaceships, females who could kick ass, and strong alpha men.  Then I started reading and intrigue became utter adoration.  I loved the story, and I realized I could write about anything I could imagine.<br><br>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b>  <br>  <i>A Hunger Like No Other</i> by Kresley Cole.  The hero chews and claws off his own leg to reach the heroine.  Now that is an act of love!  I'm still waiting for someone to do this for me.  But I digress.  I was glued to every page, couldn't put this down, and actually threatened my family with bodily harm when they dared interrupt my reading.  This is a true masterpiece, as well as the most amazing start to a series that I've ever read!  But then, <i>all</i> of Cole's books are masterpieces.    <br><br>  <i>Beyond the Highland Mist</i> by Karen Moning.  This was the first book I ever read featuring time travel and the Fae.  Plus, Karen paints such a vivid picture, I always feel like I'm in the book with the characters.  In this one, I time traveled with the heroine, I was seduced by the hero, and I was enveloped by magic.  To all three I say yes, yes, a thousand times yes.  <br><br>  <i>Welcome to Temptation</i> by Jennifer Cruise.  I have never laughed so hard while reading a book.  Cruise has the most amazing sense of humor -- humor that stems from her characters and their lives, rather than slapstick.  What's more, her characters are people I want so badly to hang out with.<br><br>    <i>Demon Moon</i> by Meljean Brook.  A vampire hero who knows how beautiful he is yet can't look into a mirror.  An everyday heroine I could identify with, even be.  And wow, is this book sexy!  Brook made me believe her characters were falling in love and by the end, I knew they were meant to be together.    <br><br>  <i>Slave to Sensation</i> by Nalini Singh.  A heroine who has been taught not to feel and a hero who lives by his emotions.  They balanced each other out, and watching them fall in love was so amazingly beautiful.  This is a truly powerful book.  <br><br>  <i>Warrior Rising</i> by P. C. Cast.  I love how P.C. twisted the story of Hercules to make it her own.  In this book, he has a beast trapped inside him and that's why he is such an indomitable, ferocious warrior.  Throw in a modern day heroine, white-hot attraction, and it's an instant page-turner! <br><br>    <i>Hitting the Mark</i> by Jill Monroe.  A hero undercover, a con artist heroine trying to go straight.  Perfection!  I loved their banter -- and the fact that the heroine wasn't afraid to dish the most delicious kind of revenge.  And then, how the two overcame their problems -- dreamy sigh.    <br><br>  <i>Twilight</i> by Stephenie Meyer.  I love the intensity of the hero's love.  I love how irresistible he finds the heroine.  I love how much they need each other.  Once I started reading, I couldn't stop.  First love meets true, everlasting love, and that's an irresistible combination for me.  <br><br>  <i>Lover Awakened</i> by J. R. Ward.  The hero was abused for many years, is physically scarred, and wants nothing to do with love.  But the heroine is attracted to him, and knows they belong together.  Plus, she's been abused, as well, and feels safest with him.  This book shows the healing power of love, is packed with gut-wrenching emotion and is utterly compelling.  <br><br>  <i>Red Fire</i> by Deidre Knight.  I was sold the moment I saw the book was about sexy Spartan warriors (I have a thing for warriors)  But there is so much more to the book.  It's an amazing blend of urban fantasy and romance, with those delicious warriors I mentioned, fighting gods and demons in modern day Savannah.  I love the way history, mythology and romance come together!   <br><br>  <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>    <i>Twilight</i>.  I loved seeing one of my favorite love stories come to life.<br><br>  <i>Anchorman</i>.  I laugh every time I watch this movie.  Will Ferrell is a comic genius.<br><br>  <i>Braveheart</i>.  Snippets of history, love, and the heartbreak of war.  So touching!<br><br>  <i>Idiocracy</i>.  Hilarious!  But hopefully not true.      <br><br>  <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b>  <br>    My tastes are eclectic.  Rock, pop, gospel, ballads, soundtracks, you name it, it's listed in my iTunes library and playing while I write.  <br><br>  <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b> <br>    Romances.  Always.  Especially the first in a series.  If l enjoy a series, I want the rest of the world to read and enjoy it, as well.  <br><br>  <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b>  <br>  I drink coffee while I write.  That way, I don't hurt the people around me and my characters get to live another day.  <br><br>  <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b>  <br>    I have so many rejection slips I can't even count them.  It took me four-five years to sell (after writing seven books).  Then it took me another four painful years to start hitting bestseller lists.  <br><br>  <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>    Write the book the way it needs to be written, not the way you think others will want you to write it.  If you love the story, that love will shine through.  Magic will happen.  <br><br></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><p><b>His powers--inhuman</b></p><p><b>His passion--beyond immortal</b></p><p>All her life, Ashlyn Darrow has been tormented by voices from the past.

That was his greatest curse and his eternal punishment.<P>He ran his tongue over his teeth, wishing it were a blade over his enemy's throat instead. Most of the day had already passed. He'd heard the time seep away, a poisonous tick-tock in his mind, every beat of the clock a mocking reminder of mortality and pain.<P>In little more than an hour, the first sting would pierce his stomach and nothing he did, nothing he said, would change that. Death would come for him.<P>"Damned gods," he muttered, increasing the speed of his bench presses.<P>"Bastards, every one of them," a familiar male voice said from behind him.<P>Maddox's motions didn't slow at Torin's unwelcome intrusion. Up. Down. Up. Down. For two hours he had worked out his frustration and anger on the punching bag, the treadmill and now the weights. Sweat ran from his bare chest and arms, riding the ropes of his muscles in clear rivulets. He should be as exhausted mentally as he was physically, but his emotions were only growing darker, more powerful. <P>"You should not be here," he said.<P>Torin sighed. "Look. I didn't mean to interrupt, but something's happened."<P>"So take care of it."<P>"I can't."<P>"Whatever it is, try. I'm in no shape to help." These last few weeks very little was needed to send him into a killing haze where no one around him was safe. Even his friends. Especially his friends. He didn't want to, never meant to, but was sometimes helpless against urges to strike and to maim.<P>"Maddox&#151;"<P>"I'm at the edge, Torin," he croaked. "I would do more harm than good."<P>Maddox knew hislimitations, had known them for thousands of years. Ever since that doomed day the gods had chosen a woman to perform a task that should have been his.<P>Pandora had been strong, yes, the strongest female soldier of their time. But he had been stronger. More capable. Yet he had been deemed too weak to guard dimOuniak, a sacred box housing demons so vile, so destructive, they could not even be trusted in Hell.<P>As if Maddox would have allowed it to be destroyed. Frustration had bloomed inside him at the affront. Inside all of them, every warrior now living here. They had fought diligently for the king of the gods, killed expertly and protected thoroughly; they should have been chosen as guards. That they hadn't was an embarrassment not to be tolerated.<P>They'd only thought to teach the gods a lesson the night they'd stolen dimOuniak from Pandora and released that horde of demons upon the unsuspecting world. How foolish they had been. Their plan to prove their power had failed, for the box had gone missing in the fray, leaving the warriors unable to recapture a single evil spirit.<P>Destruction and havoc had soon reigned, plunging the world into darkness until the king of the gods finally intervened, cursing each warrior to house a demon inside himself.<P>A fitting punishment. The warriors had unleashed the evil to avenge their stinging pride; now they would contain it.<P>And so the Lords of the Underworld were born. <P>Maddox had been given Violence, the demon who was now as much a part of him as his lungs or his heart. Now, man could no longer live without demon and demon could no longer function without man. They were woven together, two halves of a whole.<P>From  the  very  first,  the creature  inside  him  had beckoned him to do malicious things, hated things, and he'd been compelled to obey. Even when led to slay a woman&#151;to slay Pandora. His fingers clenched the bar so tightly his knuckles nearly snapped out of place. Over the years he had learned to control some of the demon's more vile compulsions, but it was a constant struggle and he knew he could shatter at any moment.<P>What he would have given for a single day of calm. No overpowering desire to hurt others. No battles within himself. No worries. No death. Just&#133;peace.<P>"It's not safe for you here," he told his friend, who still stood in the doorway. "You need to leave." He set the silver bar atop its perch and sat up. "Only Lucien and Reyes are allowed to be close to me during my demise." And only because they played a part in it, unwilling though they were. They were as helpless against their demons as Maddox was his.<P>"About an hour until that happens, so&#133;" Torin threw a rag at him. "I'll take my chances."<P>Maddox reached behind his back, caught the white cloth and turned. He wiped his face. "Water."<P>An ice-cold bottle was soaring through the air before the second syllable left his mouth. He caught it deftly, moisture splashing his chest. He drained the icy contents and studied his friend.<P>As usual, Torin wore all black and gloves covered his hands. Pale hair fell in waves to his shoulders, framing a face mortal females considered a sensual feast. They didn't know the man was actually a devil in angel's skin. They should have, though. He practically glowed with irreverence, and there was an unholy gleam in his green eyes that proclaimed he would laugh in your face while cutting out your heart. Or laugh in your face while you cut out his heart.<P>To survive, he had to find humor where he could. They all did.<P>Like every resident of this Budapest fortress, Torin was damned. He might not die every night like Maddox, but he could never touch a living thing, skin to skin, without infecting it with sickness.<P>Torin was possessed by the spirit of Disease. <P>He hadn't known a woman's touch in over four hundred years. He'd learned his lesson well when he'd given in to lust and caressed a would-be lover's face, bringing about a plague that decimated village after village. Human after human.<P>"Five minutes of your time," Torin said, his determination clear. "That's all I'm asking."<P>"Think we'll be punished for insulting the gods today?" Maddox replied, ignoring the request. If he didn't allow himself to be asked for a favor, he didn't have to feel guilty for turning it down.<P>His friend uttered another of those sighs. "Our every breath is supposed to be a punishment."<P>True. Maddox's lips curled into a slow, razored smile as he peered ceilingward. Bastards. Punish me further, I dare you. Maybe then, finally, he would fade to nothingness.<P>He doubted the gods would concern themselves, though. After bestowing the death-curse upon him, they had ignored him, pretending not to hear his pleas for forgiveness and absolution. Pretending not to hear his promises and desperate bargaining.<P>What more could they do to him, anyway?<P>Nothing could be worse than dying over and over again. Or being stripped of anything good and right&#133;or hosting the spirit of Violence inside his mind and body.<P>Jackknifing to his feet, Maddox tossed the now-wet rag and empty water bottle into the nearest hamper. He strode to the far end of the room and braced his hands above his head, leaning into the semicircular alcove of stained-glass windows and staring into the night through the only clear partition.<P>He saw Paradise.<P>He saw hell.<P>He saw freedom, prison, everything and nothing.<P>He saw&#133;home.<P>Situated atop a towering hill as the fortress was, he had a direct view of the city. Lights glowed brightly, pinks, blues and purples illuminating the murky velvet sky, glinting off the Danube River and framing the snowcapped trees that dominated the area. Wind blustered, snowflakes dancing and twirling through the air.<P>Here, he and the others had a modicum of privacy from the rest of the world. Here, they were allowed to come and go without having to face a barrage of questions. Why don't you age? Why do screams echo through the forest every night? Why do you sometimes look like a monster?<P>Here, the locals maintained their distance, awed, respectful. "Angels," he'd even heard whispered during a rare encounter with a mortal.<P>If they only knew.<P>Maddox's nails elongated slightly, digging into the stone. Budapest was a place of majestic beauty, old-world charm and modern pleasures, but he'd always felt removed from it. From the castle district that lined one street to the nightclubs that lined the next. From the fruits and vegetables hawked in one alley to the living flesh hawked in the other.<P>Maybe that sense of disconnection would vanish if he ever explored the city, but unlike the others who roamed at will, he was trapped inside the fortress and surrounding land  as  surely  as Violence  had  been  trapped  inside Pandora's box thousands of years ago.<P>His nails lengthened farther, almost claws now. Thinking of the box always blackened his mood. Punch a wall, Violence beckoned. Destroy something. Hurt, kill. He would have liked to obliterate the gods. One by one. Decapitate them, perhaps. Rip out their blackened, decayed hearts, definitely.<P>The demon purred in approval.<P>Of course it's purring now, Maddox thought with disgust. Anything bloodthirsty, no matter the victims, met with the creature's support. Scowling, he leveled another heated glance at the heavens. He and the demon had been paired long ago, but he remembered the day clearly. The screams of the innocent in his ears, humans bleeding all around him, hurting, dying, the spirits having devoured their flesh in a rapturous frenzy.<P>Only when Violence had been shoved inside his body did he lose touch with reality. There had been no sounds, no sights. Just an all-consuming darkness. He hadn't regained his senses until Pandora's blood splattered his chest, her last breath echoing in his ears.<P>She had not been his first kill&#151;or his last&#151;but she had been the first and only woman to meet his sword. The horror of seeing that once-vibrant female form broken and knowing he was responsible for it&#133; To this day, he had not assuaged the guilt, the regret. The shame and the sorrow.<P>He'd sworn to do whatever was necessary to control the spirit from then on, but it had been too late. Enraged all the more, Zeus had bestowed a second curse upon him&#58; every night at midnight he would die exactly as Pandora had died&#151;a blade through the stomach, six hellish times. The only difference was, her torment had ended within minutes.<P>His torment would last for eternity. <P>He popped his jaw, trying to relax against a new onslaught of aggression. It wasn't as if he were the only one to suffer, he reminded himself. The other warriors had their own demons&#151;literally and figuratively. Torin, of course, was keeper of Disease. Lucien was keeper of Death. Reyes, of Pain. Aeron, of Wrath. Paris, of Promiscuity.<P>Why couldn't he have been given that last one? He would have been able to journey to town anytime he wished, take any woman he desired, savoring every sound, every touch.<P>As it was, he could never venture far. Nor could he trust himself around females for long periods of time. If the demon overtook him or if he could not return home before midnight and someone found his dead, bloody body and buried him&#151;or worse, burned him&#133;<P>How he wished such a thing would end his miserable existence. He would have left long ago and allowed himself to be roasted in a pit. Or perhaps he would have jumped from the fortress's highest window and smashed his brains from his skull. But no. No matter what he did, he'd merely awaken once again, charred as well as sore. Broken as well as sliced.<P>"You've been staring at that window for a while," Torin said. "Aren't you even curious as to what's happened?"<P>Maddox blinked as he was dragged from his thoughts. "You're still here?"<P>His friend arched a black brow, the color a startling contrast to his silver-white hair. "I believe the answer to my question is no. Are you calm now, at least?"<P>Was he ever truly calm? "As calm as a creature like me can be."<P>"Stop whining. There's something I need to show you, and don't try to deny me this time. We can talk about my reason for disturbing you along the way." Without another word, Torin spun on his booted heel and strode from the room.<P>Maddox remained in place for several seconds, watching his friend disappear around the corner. Stop whining, Torin had said. Yes, that's exactly what he had been doing. Curiosity and wry amusement pushed past his lethal mood, and Maddox stepped from the gym into the hallway. A cold draft of air swirled around him, thick with moisture and the crisp scents of winter. He spied Torin a few feet away and stalked forward, quickly closing in.<P>"What's this about?"<P>"Finally. Interest," was the only response.<P>"If this is one of your tricks&#133;" Like the time Torin had ordered hundreds of blow-up dolls and placed them throughout the fortress, all because Paris had foolishly complained about the lack of female companionship in town. The plastic "ladies" had stared out from every corner, their wide eyes and let-me-suck-you mouths taunting everyone who passed them.<P>Things like that happened when Torin was bored. <P>"I wouldn't waste my time trying to trick you," Torin said without turning to face him. "You, my friend, have no sense of humor."<P>True.<P>As Maddox kept pace, stone walls stretched at his sides; sconces glowed, pulsing with light and fire, twining shadow with gold. The House of the Damned, as Torin had dubbed the place, had been built hundreds of years ago. Though they had modernized it as best they could, the age showed in the crumbling rock and the scuffed floors.<P>"Where is everyone?" Maddox asked, only then realizing he hadn't spotted any of the others.<P>"You'd think Paris would be shopping for food since our cabinets are nearly bare and that's his only duty, but no. He's out searching for a new woman."<P>Lucky bastard. Possessed as he was by Promiscuity, Paris could not bed the same woman twice, and so he seduced a new one&#151;or two or three&#151;every day. The only downside? If he couldn't find a woman, he was reduced to doing things Maddox didn't even want to contemplate. Things that left the normally good-tempered man hunched over a toilet, heaving the contents of his stomach. Though Maddox's envy abated at such moments, it always returned when Paris spoke of one of his lovers. The soft brush of a thigh&#133;the meeting of hot skin&#133;the groans of ecstasy&#133;<P>"Aeron is&#133; Prepare yourself," Torin began, "because this is the main reason I hunted you down." <P>"Did something happen to him?" Maddox demanded as darkness shuttered over his thoughts and anger overtook him. Destroy, obliterate, Violence beseeched, clawing at the corners of his mind. "Is he hurt?"<P>Immortal Aeron might be, but he could still be harmed. Even killed&#151;a feat they had all discovered in the worst possible way.<P>"Nothing like that," Torin assured him.<P>Slowly, he relaxed and gradually Violence receded. "What, then? Cleaning a mess and throwing a fit?" Every warrior here had specific responsibilities. It was their way of maintaining some semblance of order amid the chaos of their own souls. Aeron's task was maid service, something he complained about on a daily basis. Maddox took care of home repairs. Torin played with stocks and bonds, whatever those were, keeping them well-moneyed. Lucien did all the paperwork and Reyes supplied them with weapons.<P>"The gods&#133;summoned him."<P>Maddox stumbled, shock momentarily blinding him. "What?" Surely he had misheard.<P>"The gods summoned him," Torin repeated patiently. <P>But the Greeks hadn't spoken to any of them since the day of Pandora's death. "What did they want? And why am I just now hearing about this?"<P>"One, no one knows. We were watching a movie when suddenly he straightened in his seat, expression dead, as if there were no one home. Then a few seconds later he tells us he's been summoned. None of us even had time to react&#151;one minuteAeron was with us, the next he was gone.<P>"And two," Torin added with barely a pause, "I tried to tell you. You said you didn't care, remember?"<P>A muscle ticked below his eye. "You should have told me anyway." <P>"While you had barbells within your reach? Please. I'm Disease, not Stupid."<P>This was&#133;this was&#133; Maddox did not want to contemplate what this was, but could not stop the thoughts from forming. Sometimes Aeron, keeper of Wrath, lost total control  of  his  spirit  and  embarked  on  a  vengeance rampage, punishing mortals for their perceived sins. Was he now to be given a second curse for his actions, as Maddox had been all those centuries ago?
