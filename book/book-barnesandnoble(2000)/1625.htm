She has a brilliant medical mind and a remarkable ability to recall details, but her difficulty in dealing with hidden agendas and interpersonal conflicts has led her to leave the complex, money-driven dynamics of a hospital and to embrace working with the poor. Her father, Petros, is one of the most celebrated internal medicine specialists in the world and the founder of the cutting-edge Sperelakis Center for Diagnostic Medicine at Boston&rsquo;s sprawling, powerful Beaumont Clinic. <br>When Petros is severely injured by a hit-and-run driver, no one thinks he will survive. Two of Petros&rsquo;s other children, both physicians, battle Thea and their eccentric brother, Dimitri, by demanding that treatment for their father be withheld. Meanwhile, Petros lingers in the Beaumont Clinic&rsquo;s intensive care unit, where Thea is his only advocate. <br>As Thea uncovers the facts surrounding the disaster, it seems more and more to be no accident. Petros himself is the only witness. Who would want him dead? The answers are trapped in his brain...until he looks at Thea and begins to slowly blink a terrifying message. <P>In The Second Opinion, Michael Palmer has created a cat-and-mouse game where one woman must confront a conspiracy of doctors to uncover an evil practice that touches every single person who ever has a medical test. With unforgettable characters and twists and betrayals that come from the most unlikely places, The Second Opinion will keep you guessing...and looking over your shoulder.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>In this routine medical thriller from bestseller Palmer (<I>The First Patient</I>), Dr. Thea Sperelakis, an idealist who's been working for Doctors Without Borders in the Congo, rushes back to Boston after learning her physician father, Petros, an intimidating figure known as the Lion, is close to death, the victim of a hit-and-run.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>Thea Sperelakis has returned home to Boston from her latest assignment in the Congo for Doctors Without Borders. Her father, Petros, also a physician and medical director of the Sperelakis Institute, lies comatose as a result of a car accident. Although Petros apparently has locked-in syndrome and can communicate with her only by blinking an eye, Thea soon suspects that the crash was no accident. Her twin siblings, Niko and Selene, who are also doctors, never see such communications from their father and believe that he should just be allowed to die peacefully. However, older brother Dimitri, a reclusive computer programmer, is also convinced someone tried to kill their father. With help from ex-policeman and hospital security guard Dan Cotton and wealthy patient Hayley Long, Thea must overcome the limitations of her Asperger's syndrome to uncover the conspiracy behind the attempt on her father's life. Physician Palmer's 14th medical thriller (after <i>The First Patient</i>) puts the attractive and capable Thea in various kinds of peril before the surprising resolution. Buy anywhere Robin Cook and other medical thriller authors are popular.

How many patients every<p>hour, maybe every minute, rode those words screeching through a<p>sudden right- angle turn in their lives.<p><I>I&#8217;m afraid . . .<p></I>Stephen Bibby, a graduate of Emory Med, had been her physician<p>since a bout of pneumonia twenty or so years ago. He was a man<p>Hayley respected, if for no other reason than that Bibby knew his<p>limitations and never hesitated to make a phone call and arrange a<p>specialist referral for a second opinion.<p>Hayley felt a wave of nausea sweep over her, and thought for a moment<p>she was going to have to excuse herself to go and get sick even<p>before she found out precisely what she was up against. She made a<p>largely unsuccessful attempt at a calming breath, and tried to maintain<p>an even gaze.<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cancer?&#8221;<p>Hayley heard the word in her own voice, but couldn&#8217;t believe she<p>had actually uttered it. Her thoughts wouldn&#8217;t stay still.<p><I>Cancer </I>. . . <I>How could that be? . . . Oh, God, no.<p></I>Her initial symptom had been nothing more than an annoying sequence<p>of belly pain and gas. She almost hadn&#8217;t even bothered to<p>mention them to her executive assistant. He was the one who had<p>talked her into calling Bibby. It was his fault.<p>The MRI Bibby had requested was of herabdomen.<p><I>Cancer.<p></I>The dizziness and nausea intensifi ed.<p>David didn&#8217;t handle illness at all well, in himself or others, but at<p>some point she would have to tell him. Not yet, though. Not until all<p>the data were in. He was off skippering his boat in a round- the- world<p>race&#8212;his lifetime dream. He had lost his fi rst wife to a brain aneurysm,<p>and had waited more than ten years before marrying again.<p>Now this.<p>She had to tell him soon, but not yet.<p>Bibby, a Southern gentleman in his early sixties, looked toward<p>the door as if hoping that another doctor would march into the offi ce<p>and take over.<p>&#8220;I asked, is it cancer?&#8221;<p>Biting at his lip, the physician nodded.<p>&#8220;Operable?&#8221; she asked.<p><I>Come on, Stephen! Help me out here!<p></I>&#8220;I . . . I don&#8217;t know. It looks to have started in your pancreas.<p>That&#8217;s the organ which&#8212;&#8221;<p>&#8220;I know what the pancreas is. I hear Jimmy Carter talking about<p>pancreatic cancer every time I turn on the damn TV. Has it spread?&#8221;<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s . . . it <I>appears </I>to be in some places in your liver.&#8221;<p>Bibby turned on his computer with a click of his mouse and rotated<p>it so Hayley could see. A child could have picked out the cancer<p>in her MRI&#8212;an obscene white mass, dead center in her belly. <I>Dead<p>center</I>. How ironic that her mind&#8217;s default for something in the middle<p>would have been those words.<p><I>Please let this be a dream. Please let it be a fucking dream</I>.<p>Hayley rubbed at her eyes as if trying to paw away the disbelief. At<p>fi fty, she had everything she could ever have wanted&#8212;marriage to a<p>wonderful, caring man; stepchildren who treated her like their birth<p>mother; more money and infl uence than most people could even<p>dream of; and a perspective on life that made everything make sense.<p>Now this.<p><I>Pancreatic cancer . . . Inoperable . . . God, don&#8217;t let it be, </I>Hayley Long<p>thought desperately. Let it be a dream. . . . Let it be nothing but a<p>bad dream.<p>Petros Sperelakis&#8217;s awareness returned gradually and spasmodically.<p>The pain came fi rst&#8212;a dull throbbing in his groin and burning sensation<p>in his low back. He tried to move, to shift his position, but his<p>body did not respond.<p><I>Please, I don&#8217;t think I can move. Someone please help me. I&#8217;m Sperelakis,<p>Dr. Petros Sperelakis. I can&#8217;t see and I can&#8217;t move.<p></I>&#8220;Connie, why don&#8217;t you take a break. I&#8217;ll be here for another<p>hour.&#8221;<p>&#8220;Okay, thanks. Listen, Vernice, he could use some range- of- motion<p>work on his wrists and ankles.&#8221;<p><I>Connie? Vernice? I can hear you. I can hear you. Are you Beaumont nurses?<p>It&#8217;s me, Dr. Sperelakis. What do you mean, range of motion? Am I paralyzed?<p>What happened to me? An accident? A stroke? A tumor? Why can&#8217;t I see? Why<p>can&#8217;t I speak?<p></I>The man many considered to be among the premier diagnostic<p>physicians in the world struggled to make sense of his own symptoms.<p>He knew he was having diffi culty holding on to a thought, and<p>that fact frightened him more than almost anything.<p><I>Why am I in such pain? Can someone please tell me what happened? What<p>happened to me? I can feel that, Vernice. I can feel you moving my ankle. Oh,<p>my God. . . .</I><p>CHAPTER 1<p><I>Multiple contusions and abrasions . . . Fractured pelvis . . . Nondisplaced<p>fracture, proximal humerus . . . Pulmonary contusion and laceration secondary<p>to posterior displaced fractures of right seventh, eighth, and ninth<p>ribs . . .<p></I>With the grim litany ticking through her thoughts, Thea Sperelakis<p>approached Cubicle 4 in the medical ICU of the Beaumont<p>Clinic.<p><I>Transverse linear skull fracture . . . Extensive mid&#8211; brain stem hemorrhage </I>. . .<p>Level I coma . . .<p>Thea hesitated, envisioning what her father would look like and<p>knowing that, as an internal medicine specialist herself, her projection<p>would not be far from on the mark. According to her brother<p>Niko, police estimated that the vehicle that struck their father at fi ve<p>thirty in the early morning eight days ago, then drove away, had to<p>have been traveling seventy, at least. It was a miracle he had survived<p>the impact, which threw him more than twenty- fi ve feet. But then,<p>for as long as Thea could remember, Petros Sperelakis was, to his<p>children, the Lion&#8212;aloof, powerful, and brilliant, often to the point<p>of majesty.<p><I>The Lion</I>.<p>The absence of skid marks suggested that the driver never saw his<p>victim. Make that his <I>or her </I>victim, Thea edited, intent on enforcing<p>that sort of accuracy, even in her thoughts. The police still had no<p>clues and no witnesses.<p>Alcohol, she guessed. According to an article by Eileen Posnick in<p>a seven- year- old issue of the <I>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse,<p></I>alcohol was involved in more than 90 percent of hit- and- run accidents<p>where the drivers were eventually apprehended.<p>Behind her, Niko stepped out from the group that included his<p>twin, Selene, plus a trio of Beaumont Clinic dignitaries, and took<p>Thea&#8217;s arm. He was swarthy and broad- shouldered, with their father&#8217;s<p>strong nose and piercing dark eyes, but with features that were<p>somewhat softer. At forty, he was already an associate professor of<p>cardiac surgery at Harvard&#8212;a wunderkind, with several signifi cant<p>contributions to the fi eld. Selene, exotic, elegant, and totally selfassured,<p>was no less accomplished as a hand surgeon.<p>&#8220;You okay, Thea?&#8221; Niko asked softly.<p>As she had been taught to do, Thea searched her feelings before<p>responding. Her father, bigger than life itself, was in a deep coma<p>from which there was a 0.01 percent chance he would recover even<p>minimal function&#8212;at least according to the retrospective study of<p>traumatic midbrain hemorrhages published by Harkinson et al. in the<p><I>American Archives of Neurology, </I>volume 117, page 158. One in ten thousand,<p>not counting the ribs and other fractures.<p><I>Poor Dad.<p></I>&#8220;I&#8217;m okay,&#8221; she replied.<p>&#8220;Want to go in alone?&#8221;<p><I>Why would I want to do that? </I>she wondered, shaking her head.<p>Would their father be any less comatose if she saw him by herself?<p>She shrugged that it made no diff erence, but sensed she could have<p>come up with a more acceptable response.<p>&#8220;Suit yourself,&#8221; Niko said in a tone that was quite familiar to her.<p>Thea knew her brother cared about her&#8212;Selene, too. She also<p>knew that the twins had always thought she was odd, though certainly<p>not as odd as their oldest sibling, Dimitri. But their attitude, as<p>emphasized over and over by Thea&#8217;s longtime therapist and mentor,<p>Dr. Paige Carpenter, was their problem.<p><I>One in ten thousand . . . Poor Dad</I>.<p>Thea ran her fi ngers through her short chestnut hair, took a single<p>deep breath, and stepped through the doorway.<p>As anticipated, there were no surprises. Legendary Petros Sperelakis,<p>medical director of the Sperelakis Institute for Diagnostic<p>Medicine, lay motionless&#8212;the central fi gure in a tableau of medical<p>machines. Across the room, his private duty nurse (Haitian, Thea<p>guessed) rose and introduced herself as Vernice.<p>&#8220;I have heard a great deal about you, Dr. Thea,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I hope<p>your fl ight was an easy one.&#8221;<p>&#8220;I just read,&#8221; Thea said, taking the husky woman&#8217;s smooth, ample<p>hand.<p><I>I just read</I>.<p>It was, Thea knew, the most resounding of understatements. During<p>the twenty- hour series of fl ights and layovers from the Democratic<p>Republic of the Congo to Boston, she had read <I>Don Quixote, </I>the<p>second edition of Deadman&#8217;s <I>A Manual of Acu punc ture </I>(for the second<p>time), and Darwin&#8217;s <I>Voyage of the </I>Beagle&#8212;more than sixteen hundred<p>pages in all. She would have made the trip home sooner, but she<p>was on a mission moving from refugee camp to camp in the bush<p>with a team of nutritionists, and simply couldn&#8217;t be reached.<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been no change,&#8221; Vernice said.<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be most surprised if there were. He has taken a severe<p>beating&#8212;especially to his head.&#8221;<p>Thea approached the bedside, instinctively checking the monitors<p>and intravenous infusions. Petros lay quite peacefully, connected via<p>a tracheotomy tube to a state- of- the- art ventilator. The various<p>Medecins Sans Fronti&#232;res (Doctors Without Borders) hospitals to<p>which Thea had been assigned over the past fi ve years had been reasonably<p>well equipped, but nothing like this place.<p>The Beaumont, as nearly everyone referred to the institution, was<p>a sprawling campus, the size of a small university, consisting of what<p>had once been Boston Metropolitan Hospital, now augmented by<p>two dozen more buildings, varying widely in architectural style. The<p>buildings were linked by tree- lined sidewalks above, and an intricate<p>maze of tunnels below, some with moving walkways and others with<p>tarnished tile walls, leading in places to stairways that went down for<p>two or three damp stories, and dating back to Metro&#8217;s earliest days<p>in the mid- nineteenth century.<p>Oxygen saturation . . . arterial blood pressure . . . cerebrospinal<p>fl uid pressure . . . central venous pressure . . . urine output . . .<p>chest tube drainage . . . cardiac rhythm and ECG pattern . . .<p>Thea took in the complex data and pro cessed them as if they were<p>a grade- school primer. Steady. Everything was nice and steady. At<p>the moment, the fi erce battle for the life of Petros Sperelakis was being<p>fought at a cellular and even subcellular level. And his youn gest<p>off spring, cursed by him when she made the decision to avoid academic<p>medicine and &#8220;give her ser vices away,&#8221; to third- world countries,<p>pictured the microscopic confl ict clearly in her mind&#8217;s eye.<p>At best it would probably be weeks before the man regained any<p>consciousness. Along the way, his system would have to negotiate a<p>minefi eld of infections, blood clots, kidney stones, embolisms, ce rebral<p>swelling, chemical imbalance, intestinal obstructions, and cardiac<p>events. But in this setting, with this equipment, he would at<p>least have a fi ghting chance. Still, from what Thea knew of her father,<p>if it were his choice, it was doubtful he would try very hard to steer<p>clear of the mines.<p>She took the man&#8217;s hand and held it for a time. It had been only<p>eight days since the accident, but his muscle mass was already beginning<p>to waste away. In addition to the trach, he had a gastric feeding<p>tube in place, two IVs, a urinary catheter, which was draining briskly<p>into a collection bag, and a BOLT pressure manometer that passed<p>through his skull and into the spinal fl uid&#8211;containing ventricle of his<p>brain. His eyelids were paper- taped down to protect his corneas<p>from drying out, and splints on his wrists and ankles were strapped<p>in place to prevent joint contractures, against the remote possibility<p>of a return of function.<p>Petros Sperelakis&#8212;an icon brought down by a driver who was either<p>in an alcoholic blackout or was aware enough to try and get away<p>before anyone showed up. Never had Thea&#8217;s father looked even remotely<p>vulnerable to her. Now, he looked frail and pathetically infantile.<p>Thea sensed that she was expected to stay at the bedside a bit longer,<p>and she planned to be there as much as possible in the days to<p>come. But she had slept little if any on the planes, and the exhaustion<p>of the fl ights was beginning to take hold. Fifteen minutes, she decided.<p>Fifteen more minutes would be enough to stay at the bedside<p>whether the others thought so or not.<p>Niko had invited her to stay at his house, but three kids under ten,<p>much as she loved them, provided more commotion than she could<p>handle.<p>Selene and her partner, a banker or businesswoman of some kind,<p>lived in a designer high- rise condo by the harbor.<p>The obvious choice was the spacious Wellesley home in which she<p>and the others had grown up, and where Petros still lived with the<p>ghost of their mother and with Dimitri who, many years before, had<p>moved into the carriage house along with his computers, his monitors,<p>his shortwave radio, his telescope, his machinery, his library of<p>manga, graphic novels, and Dungeons and Dragons manuals, and his<p>vast collection of Coca- Cola and Star Wars memorabilia.<p>It would be good to see her brother again for many reasons, not<p>the least of which was that of all those in her family, he was the one<p>she related to the most&#8212;something of a mirror of what she might<p>have been like had she not had the benefi t of early diagnosis, intervention,<p>and extensive behavior modifi cation therapy.<p>From her early childhood, Thea had memories of the family talking<p>about Dimitri&#8217;s aloofness and strange behaviors&#8212;his lack of<p>friends, off beat humor, and often- inappropriate statements. Physical<p>age, twelve years ahead of her. Emotional age, inconsistent and unpredictable.<p><I>&#8220;Dimitri, this is Robert, your new piano teacher.&#8221;<p>&#8220;Oh, hello. When&#8217;s the last time you went to the dentist?&#8221;<p></I>She would never know the bulk of what the family said to one another<p>about her, but she also knew that the choices she had made,<p>with Dr. Carpenter&#8217;s help, were the right ones for her, and ultimately,<p>for her patients. Keeping her life as uncomplicated as possible,<p>she had learned, was not only a pathway to happiness, it was<p>her roadmap to survival. If there was any single word that did <I>not </I>apply<p>to Petros Sperelakis, it was uncomplicated.<p>Born and raised in Athens until his late teens, Petros was strictly<p>Old Country in his attitudes and philosophy&#8212;a brilliant physician as<p>dedicated to his calling and his patients as he was hard on his family.<p>Verbal chastisement and high expectations were his weapons, as well<p>as his only means of expressing love. His wife, Eleni, had rebelled<p>against him in one way and one way only, by continuing to smoke<p>cigarettes despite his vehement edicts that she stop. The lung cancer<p>that took her did nothing to soften Petros, and virtually every mention<p>of her by him was followed by the impotent plea&#58; &#8220;If she had only<p>listened to me . . . If only she had listened.&#8221;<p>Thea reached between the tubes and brushed some damp, gray<p>hair from her father&#8217;s brow. The sadness she was feeling at seeing<p>him in such a state was, she knew, as much learned as it was deepseated<p>and visceral. But she also knew that it was still as real an emotion<p>as those of her two &#8220;neurotypical&#8221; siblings.<p>From the beginning, Petros could never understand her shyness,<p>or the severe reactions she had to certain noises&#8212;especially vacuum<p>cleaners and hair dryers&#8212;as well as to certain foods, and diff erent<p>textures of clothing. When she was twelve, pressured by Eleni that<p>she was seeming more and more like Dimitri in her lack of friends<p>and her pathological obsessions, especially with books of all kinds,<p>Petros consented to allow his wife to bring her to Dr. Carpenter. It<p>was Carpenter who subsequently suggested that Thea was exhibiting<p>many of the symptoms associated with the condition called Asperger<p>syndrome.<p>The decision to allow his younger daughter to undergo neuropsychiatric<p>testing and therapy did not come easily to Petros. In the<p>lexicon of his life, there was no such word as <I>can&#8217;t </I>and no such concept<p>as psychotherapy. If he had any weakness at all as a diagnostician,<p>it was in the area of psychosomatic illness and the mind- body<p>connection.<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s comfortable,&#8221; Vernice ventured from across the bed.<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he is,&#8221; Thea replied, managing with some diffi culty to<p>swallow her belief that if Petros was feeling anything, then he was<p>certainly not comfortable, and if he was feeling nothing at all, then<p>trying to equate that void with comfort was a stretch.<p>&#8220;Your brother Dimitri said that if your father was in as deep a<p>coma as he appears to be, it was a futile exercise to wonder if he was<p>comfortable or not.&#8221;<p>&#8220;Sometimes, Dimitri says things just for the shock eff ect,&#8221; Thea<p>replied, smiling inwardly at the number of times and situations in<p>which her eccentric sibling had done just that. Vernice had gotten off<p>relatively easily.<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the nurse said, &#8220;at least we have the comfort of knowing<p>that Dr. S. is being taken care of in the greatest hospital in the<p>world.&#8221;<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Thea said, wondering where Vernice, and <I>Newsweek, </I>and the<p>countless others who believed as she did about the Beaumont, could<p>have gotten such quantifi cation about something so unquantifi able.<p>at virtually the same instant, in the Susan and Clyde Terry Cancer<p>Center, on the far side of the broad campus of the so- called greatest<p>hospital in the world, the treatment nurse was doing her job,<p>injecting a cutting- edge experimental drug into the central IV port<p>of a burly man named Jeff rey Fagone.<p>Fagone, a trucking magnate from western Pennsylvania, had his<p>rapid accumulation of wealth interrupted by an unusual variant of<p>the blood cancer known as Waldenstrom&#8217;s macroglobulinemia. His<p>presenting symptom had been lower-back pain. The referral by his primary<p>care doctor had been to the expert in the disease at the Beaumont,<p>where Fagone went yearly for his fi ve- day spa pampering and<p>executive medical checkup. Now, he was part of a cutting- edge treatment<p>protocol&#8212;the sort of protocol that the doctors at the Beaumont<p>were renowned for establishing.<p>Fagone fl ew up to the Terry Center weekly on his Gulfstream<p>G500 corporate jet. Now he was about to receive the third in a series<p>of ten treatments. The fi rst two had been absolutely uneventful.<p>This injection, however, would be diff erent.<p>The vial from which the medication was drawn had been skillfully<p>switched during its journey from the research pharmacy to the cancer<p>center. The new vial, with the same ID number as the old one, now<p>contained enough concentrated bee venom to turn Fagone&#8217;s bee sting<p>allergy, duly noted in his medical record, into an anaphylactic<p>reaction&#8212;a fearsome medical emergency, equivalent to the Fourth<p>of July fi reworks on the Charles River Esplanade.<p>The eruption did not take long to begin. The fi rst few molecules of<p>the venom instantly began mobilizing mast cells from all over<p>Fagone&#8217;s body. The cells released huge amounts of histamine and<p>other sensitivity chemicals. More venom, more mast cells, more histamine.<p>In less than a minute, Fagone&#8217;s tongue, cardinal red, had<p>swollen to the size of a golf ball, and his lips to violet sausages. The<p>muscles in the walls of his bronchial tubes went into vicious spasm.<p>Seconds after that, his larynx, also in spasm, closed off altogether.<p>His entire body became scarlet, and his fi ngers became nothing more<p>than nubs protruding from softball- sized hands.<p>The team in the Terry unit acted quickly, bringing out a stretcher<p>and hoisting the two- hundred- and- seventy- pound former teamster<p>onto it, then wheeling him to an area that could be screened off from<p>other patients.<p>But they were paddling against a medical tsunami.<p>The IV port was available, but the oncologist covering the unit, a<p>young woman less than half Fagone&#8217;s size, was not skilled in dealing<p>with emergencies of this magnitude. By the time she got the right<p>medications into the man, Fagone&#8217;s blood pressure had been zero<p>for nearly three minutes. By the time she gave up trying to force an<p>endotracheal breathing tube past the massively swollen, distorted<p>vocal cords, and began clumsily performing her fi rst emergency tracheotomy<p>while waiting for the ENT surgeon to answer his page,<p>there had been no eff ective respirations for four minutes. She had<p>just sliced a scalpel across her patient&#8217;s massive throat when his<p>heart stopped. The blood fl owing from the gaping laceration was<p>gentian.<p>When the oncologist, frustrated and utterly demoralized, called<p>off the resuscitation at the ten- minute mark, a useful airway had still<p>not been established.<p>Jeff rey Fagone, who years before had survived two assassination<p>attempts during his rise to wealth and power in the Teamsters<p>Union, had no chance of surviving this one.<p>Unlike the other attempts, however, there was no suspicion of<p>anything sinister at work here. Fagone had been done in by a lethal<p>allergic reaction to Waldenstrom&#8217;s macroglobulinemia experimental<p>drug #BW1745. No one present that day thought otherwise. There<p>would be no analysis of the contents of the vial, and the perfunctory<p>autopsy performed the next morning would disclose nothing out of<p>the ordinary.<p>The treatment protocol for #BW1745 would be suspended indefi -<p>nitely, but within just a few months, the principal investigator, supported<p>by a hefty grant from one of the pharmaceutical giants, would<p>roll out another experimental drug to meet the demand of referrals<p>from all over the world.<p>The Susan and Clyde Terry Cancer Center closed for cleanup and<p>staff support for an hour after the tragic event, but there were patients<p>to treat, many of whom had come from even greater distances<p>than Jeff rey Fagone.<p>Soon, like the surface of a pond disturbed by a jumping fish, the<p>ripples had subsided, and the world&#8217;s greatest hospital had gone back<p>to being the world&#8217;s greatest hospital.<p> <p><p>
