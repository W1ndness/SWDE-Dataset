For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares.  John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction.  Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.<P>It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters&#58; the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the "soul of pampered self-absorption"; the...</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>It's difficult to categorize this book. On one level, it is a travelogue, recounting former <i>New York</i> magazine editor Berendt's eight years in Savannah, Georgia, that beautifully preserved hothouse of the South where eccentric characters like black drag queen Lady Chablis and charming con man Joe Odom blossom in rich profusion. It is also a true-crime tale, the saga of antiques dealer Jim Williams whose 1981 shooting of his sometime lover Danny Hansford in the historic Mercer House obsesses Savannah denizens; they watch as Williams endures four trials and is eventually acquitted, only to die of a heart attack a few months later, haunted (some say) by Hansford's vengeful ghost. Although non-fiction, Berendt's book reads like a novel (he admits he has taken 'certain storytelling liberties'), and this reviewer sometimes wondered where the truth ends and the fiction begins. Still, this entertaining book will appeal to many readers.-- Wilda Williams

											Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a splendid piece of nonfiction. Part true crime, part Savannah guidebook, it reaches beyond both of these to become a captivating character study. John Berendt effortlessly captures the voices of both the people he meets and the city of Savannah, itself. And yet, though his impressions and experiences shape the narrative, he remains an understated presence in the book, offering what he sees and hears with minimal commentary, and leaving us, the readers, with the sense that it is we who are in fact meeting these people and this place. As their new acquaintances, moreover, we're free and welcome to come to our own conclusions about the quality of their characters, and so we, too, become drawn into the book's singular series of events. Deftly rendered with elegant and evocative prose, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a funny, insightful, and often touching glimpse into Savannah's charming, mysterious heart.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>A good introduction to Savannah culture<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Lonnie">Lonnie</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1377284_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780679751526_BK_1_1377284" href="#previewReview_1377284" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 06, 2010:

"I encourage them, they make good copy."  <p>  They do indeed, if Berendt is writing about them. His first book, <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I>, which Berendt has called "a nonfiction novel," could be classified as a true crime story, or a travelogue, but it's also an absorbing collection of crazy people, cranks, eccentrics and oddballs, whose lives Berendt chronicles with as much detail as he devotes to murder suspect Jim Williams, ostensibly his main character.  <p>  As readers and critics have noted, the true "main character" of <I>Midnight in the Garden</I> is the city of Savannah, Ga., which enjoyed a tremendous boost in tourism as a result of what Savannahians now refer to simply as "the book."  <p>  Berendt started visiting Savannah in the early 1980s, flying in from New York, where he worked as a writer at <I>Esquire</I>. "All I did the first year," he later said in the <I>London Daily Telegraph</I>, "was take notes and interview, because I knew, the longer I was there, the less strange the whole thing would seem."  <p>  For Berendt, who once edited <I>New York</I> magazine, Savannah may have seemed strange at first, but in a fascinating way. As he explained in an <I>Entertainment Weekly</I> interview, "People in Savannah don't say, 'Before leaving the room, Mrs. Jones put on her coat.' Instead, they say, 'Before leaving the room, Mrs. Jones put on the coat that her third husband gave her before he shot himself in the head.'"  <p>  After gathering facts, gossiping with the locals and getting to know the city, Berendt shaped his experiences into a work <I>Kirkus Reviews</I> called "stylish, brilliant, hilarious, and coolhearted." <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I> spent a record-setting four years on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller list and sold 2.7 million copies in hardcover.  <p>  Not everyone adored it, however. In a controversy that perhaps anticipated author James Frey's troubles in the publishing world, some journalists wondered whether Berendt's embellishments were too numerous and substantial for the book to hold up as nonfiction. The book included an author's note explaining that Berendt changed the sequence of some events in the narrative.  <p>  <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I> became a fixture on bestseller lists and was made into a movie directed by Clint Eastwood. Some of the real people profiled in the book became minor celebrities in their own right -- most notably Berendt's drag-queen friend Lady Chablis, who played herself in the movie and later published an autobiography.  <p>  Readers wondered what Berendt would do for an encore, but the author was relatively slow to oblige them. It wasn't until more than ten years after the publication of his first book that Berendt released <I>The City of Falling Angels</I>, a portrait of Venice as experienced not by tourists, but by its year-round residents, who turn out to be as eccentric and weirdly compelling as the Savannahians of <I>Midnight in the Garden</I>. ("The man whose palazzo features three space suits and a stuffed monkey is par for the course," noted Janet Maslin in <I>The New York Times Book Review</I>.)  <p>  Though some critics thought Berendt's second book lacked the narrative pull of his first, many agreed that, as <I>Washington Post</I> critic Jonathan Yardley put it, "The story of the Fenice fire and its aftermath is exceptionally interesting, the cast of characters is suitably various and flamboyant, and Berendt's prose, now as then, is precise, evocative and witty."  <p>  As Ann Godoff, Berendt's editor (first at Random House and now at Penguin Press), explained it, "By no means is this the same book. But nobody else could have written them both."  <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some fun and fascinating outtakes from our interview with Behrendt: </I> <p>  <b>"I never use an alarm clock. I have an internal mechanism</b> that wakes me up when I want to wake up. I'm not sure how I developed this ability, or what its significance is. Anyhow, I always fall asleep secure in the knowledge that I will wake up within ten minutes of the desired time. And I always do. <p>    <b>"When I'm writing, I like to gain distance from my work</b> so I can tell how it will strike a reader who is seeing it for the first time. I do this through a trick I devised while I was living in Savannah writing <I>Midnight</I> -- I would call my apartment in New York, the answering machine would pick up, I'd read the page of text I'd just written, then I'd hang up. A minute later, I'd call my apartment again and listen to the "message." Hearing my own voice reading the page over the phone -- my voice having traveled 1800 miles (900 each way ) -- gave me just the detached perspective I needed. <p>    "On occasion, while I was working on <I>Falling Angels</I>, I used the same technique, ridiculous though it may sound; in this case the calls were from Venice to New York rather than from Savannah. Gay Talese says he achieves a similar detachment by tacking pages to the opposite wall and then reading them through binoculars. Whatever works."<p>              <b>"I had an early start in the world of books. I was hired at the age of fourteen</b> as a stock boy at the Economy Book Store in downtown Syracuse. It was my first job. I worked after school every day for four hours and made ten dollars a week." <p>        <b>"I stay fit by exercising daily on a treadmill or a stationary bicycle</b> for close to an hour. I'd be bored out of my mind doing this if it weren't for the fact that I watch movies at the same time.  That way, time flies. I call it my Treadmill and Bicycle Film Festival. I've found that if I'm watching a thriller, my pace ratchets up a notch."  <p>    <b>"My number-one hobby, my preferred means of unwinding</b>, and my most often-used route of escape are all the same: reading. Nothing takes me out of myself faster or more completely than a good read. It relieves stress, lifts me out of a funk, and makes me feel I'm doing something worthwhile. <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the Fall of 2005, John Berendt took some time out to tell us about some of his favorite books, authors, and interests:</I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b>  I could cite any number of great classics that, when I first read them, introduced me to the excitement of books, but the book that meant the most to me is not at all well known and is now out of print. <p>    It's <I>Small World</I> a novel published in 1951 by Simon & Schuster. The story concerns a family of four living in upstate New York. It's charming and beautifully written. Carol Deschere, the author, happens to be my mother, and the family depicted in her novel closely resembles our own. The book sold about 2,000 copies and, although my mother never wrote another book, <I>Small World</I> was a life-changing experience for me, because in addition to making me enormously proud of her, it showed me for the first time how real life could be transformed into words and stories and published in a book for all to read. It also planted the first seed in my mind that I might become a writer one day. <p>    <b>re ten your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  I wouldn't know how to start listing my ten favorite books, since that's not the way I think of books, or of anything else for that matter. Clifton Fadiman once edited a collection of pieces, fiction and nonfiction, entitled <I>Reading I've Liked</I>. So, I'm going to call the following list, "Books I've Liked":<p>    <li><I>Nicholas Nickleby</I> by Charles Dickens -- The experience of reading Dickens has been a lifelong pleasure. I go from book to book and back again. Of all Dickens's novels, Nicholas Nickleby has a special standing with me, because it was the first one I read to myself. I was deeply impressed, at the age of twelve, by the squalid boys school Dotheboys Hall, run by the horrid Wackford Squeers and his wretched wife, who force-feeds the boys a miserable breakfast of brimstone and treacle, all from the same too-large wooden spoon, then calls a curly-headed child to come forward so that she can wipe her hands in his hair. That scene and that book propelled me into years of reading Dickens.   <p>    <li><I>Collected Stories</I> by Tennessee Williams -- This is a book I've given as a gift countless times, usually when I've discovered that someone hasn't read it or hasn't even heard of it. Tennessee Williams's plays have overshadowed his short stories, and small wonder, but these forty-nine stories span most of his life from the age of sixteen until the very end. As Gore Vidal points out in his affectionate and informative introduction, the collected stories are "the true memoir of Tennessee Williams. Whatever happened to him, real or imagined, is here." <p>    The stories are about love, longing and loneliness, and they are flavored with a connoisseur's taste for the loony and the bizarre. On occasion, the glimmer of a future work flashes by, like the line in Williams's haunting "The Mysteries of the Joy Rio" that reads, "But the sweet bird of youth had flown from Pablo Gonzales, leaving him rather sad..." For me, the best of the stories is the fiendish "Desire and the Black Masseur," but there are a good many runners-up.  <p>    <li><I>The Age of Innocence</I>by Edith Wharton -- The wistful regret of having made the wrong decision in life and realized it too late makes this book as heart-wrenchingly relevant today as it was eighty-five years ago. And Wharton's writing style is just as fresh and durable. <p>    I commend to anyone, for example, her astonishing 165-word description of the doyenne of New York society, Mrs. Manson Mingott, beginning with the words, "The immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle life like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump active little woman with a neatly-turned foot and ankle into something as vast and august as a natural phenomenon. She had accepted this submergence as philosophically as all her other trials, and now, in extreme old age, was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost unwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh, in the center of which the traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation...."  Wharton was a master in the art of prose portraiture.  <P>        <li><I>In Patagonia</I> by Bruce Chatwin -- This is travel writing at its best. As a boy, Chatwin was fascinated by a dried-up piece of skin and hair, said to be from a brontosaurus brought back from Patagonia by a distant cousin. Chatwin's musings about the brontosaurus eventually led to a trek through Patagonia described in ninety-seven brief chapters filled with sharp observations and crystal-clear prose. They are gem-like entries in a brilliant diary. The narrative meanders, just as Chatwin did on his journey. Passages describing the stark landscape are side-by-side with profiles of people encountered, nuggets of historical lore, and the details of rugged overland travel. Readers who insist on a traditional narrative thread might be disappointed, even put off.  But for me, Chatwin evokes a serene curiosity that I found captivating.  <P>    <li><I>The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor</I> -- Flannery O'Connor is simply the best.  She enshrines in each of her characters an unforgettable rendition of a basic human flaw: venality, bigotry, pent-up anger, stupidity, jealousy, greed, even innocence. Her dark humor is funniest when she is laying bare some horrible piece of human nastiness. And the writing! She can evoke more from the particulars of a person's face than any other writer I know.  For example: <p>     "His face behind the windshield was sour and froglike; it looked like it had a shout closed up in it, it looked like one of those closet doors in gangster pictures where there is somebody tied to a chair behind it with a towel in his mouth." ("The Heart of the Park")<p>    "He heard the words drag out � �Well, the way I see it, men elect....' He felt them pull out of his mouth like freight cars, jangling, backing up on each other, grating to a halt, sliding, clinching back, jarring, and then suddenly stopping as roughly as they had begun." ("The Barber")<p>    "His neck was thrust forward as if he were trying to smell something that was always being drawn away." ("The Peeler")<p>    "She jumped back and looked as if she were going to swallow her face." ("The Peeler")<p>    "Besides the neutral expression that she wore when she was alone, Mrs. Freeman had two others, forward and reverse, that she used for all her human dealings. Her forward expression was steady and driving like the advance of a heavy truck. Her eyes never swerved to the left or right but turned as the story turned as if they followed a yellow line down the center of it. She seldom used the other expression because it was not often necessary for her to retract a statement, but when she did, her face came to a complete stop. ("Good Country People")<p>    If I were forced to pick my one Flannery O'Connor story above all others, I'd resist, but if pressed I'd say, "Well, okay: 'Revelation.' If you've never read any of her stories, start with that one, and if you aren't compelled to read all the others afterwards, then you'll never have to take my word about anything ever again." <p>    <li><I>Neuromancer</I> by Williams Gibson -- Gibson is the man who invented the term "cyberspace," and this is the book that launched the digital science-fiction genre back in 1984, long before the Internet existed as we know it now. This dark, fast-paced novel is a visionary masterpiece. It's populated by hackers and cyberpunks, Gibson's creations that have since become fixtures in the electronic matrix. I was given the book in the mid-1990s, when the Internet was beginning to wrap itself around all of us, and I read it with increasing excitement -- and not without some difficulty. Gibson doesn't bother to explain his terms or lead the reader by the hand through the puzzling dislocations of his futuristic landscape. <I>Neuromancer</I> is pulp fiction, but it's guided by a hip wisdom about a baffling phenomenon that was only beginning to take shape.    <p>    <li><I>The Alexandria Quartet</I> by Lawrence Durrell -- I read these four books in my late teens and early twenties, which may have had something to do with my having been swept away by them -- by the sheer poetry of the writing, the sensuous atmosphere of Alexandria, the sexual tension, and above all the mystery and ambiguity.  <p>    <li><I>Where I'm Calling From</I> by Raymond Carver -- Carver's stories were a revelation to me when I encountered them for the first time in the early 1980s. His spare, minimalist style serves as a writer's manual for how to get more out of less. In a sentence, or even just a phrase, Carver establishes the mood, the nature of his characters and their predicament. He gives us clues instead of paragraphs of description or lengthy dialogue. I often put people on to Carver, especially when they've shown me something they've written that needs drastic paring down. Carver had something original to show the rest of us, and his early death is a real tragedy. My own copy of this collection (thirty stories arranged chronologically by the date they were written) is well worn.  <p>    <li><I>The Aspern Papers</I> by Henry James -- This psychological thriller is a Jamesian masterpiece and also one of his most accessible novels. It's about ambition, deception, invasion of privacy, and the shameless exploitation of the past. "You publishing scoundrel!" the ancient Juliana Bordereau shouts at the narrator when she catches him rifling through her effects in search of her love letters. James based this exquisite tale on a true story about Claire Clairmont, the former mistress of Lord Byron and mother of his illegitimate daughter, Allegra. Ms. Clairmont, living in Florence in extreme old age, was set upon by an unscrupulous American scholar hoping to lay his hands on her love letters from Bryon. In fictionalizing the story and moving it to Venice, James enriched the it and heightened its dramatic appeal immeasurably.  <p>    <li><I>The Magic Christian</I> by Terry Southern -- I include this quirky novel in my list, because it is a satiric gem and one of the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. Terry Southern was a comic genius (<I>Dr. Strangelove</I>, <I>Candy</I>) who has never really been given his due. The argument of <I>The Magic Christian</I> is a simple one, namely: There is no limit to what you can make people do, given enough money. Everyone has his price. In this slim volume, Southern illustrates his point in a story that becomes increasingly bizarre and culminates in one of the most outrageous scenes in the entire American literary canon.  <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Kind Hearts and Coronets</I> -- Alec Guinness playing eight members of the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family -- male and female, each one dottier than the next -- is a supreme comic tour de force that always delights me. But then I have a soft spot for Guinness.  His Ealing Studio comedies -- <I>The Lady Killers</I>, <I>The Lavender Hill Mob</I>, <I>The Man in the White Suit</I> -- serve up a world of understated British humor that I've always found gently reassuring.  <p>    <li><I>Juliet of the Spirits</I>, directed by Federico Fellini -- I have a weakness for Fellini's fantasies. The music of Nina Rota has a lot to do with the spell this picture casts.<p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  At home, when I listen to music, it's usually jazz. However, when I'm writing I can't listen to any music at all, because the rhythm of the music interferes with the rhythm and flow of the syllables, sentences, and paragraphs. Rhythm is as important to me as the choice of words. It often determines the choice, in fact. Sometimes when I've written a sentence that says precisely what I want it to say with exactly the right words, it still needs an extra syllable or two at a certain place.  Ezra Pound once said that it's easy to imitate another writer's style, but it's impossible to imitate his rhythm.  <p>         <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  <I>The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror</I>, by Bernard Lewis. This is an even-handed discussion of one of the most confounding issues facing the world today. Most of us are dangerously ignorant about Islam and terrorism and have no way of distinguishing between them.  Lewis offers a corrective. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I get the greatest pleasure giving books that I've read and enjoyed, because it means I'm not just giving someone a physical book but a reading experience that I've sampled and approved. It becomes a shared experience. Naturally that's the kind of book I like to receive, too. More than half the books I read are books people have recommended to me -- word of mouth. Well, my approach to gift-giving is word of mouth with the actual book thrown in. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I like to write at a fairly clean desk, but I'm almost never able to do it. I put all my research into loose-leaf notebooks, arranged by topic, character and story, and I line them up on a shelf. That may sound very organized, but somehow it doesn't prevent loose papers from accumulating on my desk anyway, forming heaps and piles over and under the books, magazines, newspapers, pamphlets and jotted-down notes that somehow make their way to my desk despite my efforts to keep them under control.  <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  By the time I decided to write my first book, I had already had a productive, 25-year-long career as a magazine editor and columnist. After graduating from college, where I had been an editor of the <I>Harvard Lampoon</I>, I was hired as an editor by <I>Esquire</I>. Later, I served as the editor of <I>New York</I> magazine and then wrote a monthly column for <I>Esquire</I>. As much as I enjoyed working for magazines, I never had the time to delve deeply into any subject.  I'd work on a column or an article for a month or two and then move on to another topic. I was skimming the surface, and ultimately it was unsatisfying. So, in 1985, while supporting myself with my column and other freelance writing, I moved to Savannah, Georgia and started working on the book that turned out to be <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I>.<p>      My rejection-slip horror story is a very unusual one. I wrote <I>Midnight</I> under my own steam, without a contract, because I didn't want to be held to a deadline and owe a publisher a book or its money back. After seven years, I was finished. I sent the manuscript to my agent, who was one of the better-known agents in New York, and to my surprise, she turned it down. My agent, mind you -- not a publisher. She sent it back to me with a note saying it was "too local" and that she doubted any publisher would want to take a chance on it "in this market," whatever that meant. <p>    The rejection did not upset me as much as it might have, because as an experienced editor I knew the book was at least publishable. So I gave the manuscript to another agent, who read it, loved it, and sent copies to five publishing houses, giving them three days to read it and make an offer if they wanted it. All five submitted bids, and I ended up signing a contract with Random House. I occasionally run into my former agent in New York, and I am cordial. I have no reason not to be. The way things turned out, I'm lucky she rejected it.<p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Keep a diary, but don't just list all the things you did during the day. Pick one incident and write it up as a brief vignette. Give it color, include quotes and dialogue, shape it like a story with a beginning, middle and end -- as if it were a short story or an episode in a novel. It's great practice.  Do this while figuring out what you want to write a book about. The book may even emerge from within this running diary.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty,early morning hours of May 2, 1981.&#160;&#160;Was it murder or self-defense?&#160;&#160;For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares.&#160;&#160;John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction.&#160;&#160;Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.<br><br><br><br>It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters&#58; the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the &quot;soul of pampered self-absorption&quot;; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight.&#160;&#160;These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else. <br><br><br><br><b> Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&#58; A Savannah Story </b> is a sublime and seductive reading experience.&#160;&#160;Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city is certain to become a modern classic.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>It's difficult to categorize this book.

It is also a true-crime tale, the saga of antiques dealer Jim Williams whose 1981 shooting of his sometime lover Danny Hansford in the historic Mercer House obsesses Savannah denizens; they watch as Williams endures four trials and is eventually acquitted, only to die of a heart attack a few months later, haunted (some say) by Hansford's vengeful ghost.

In the early 1980's, Berendt (former editor of <i>New York</i> magazine) realized that for the price of a nouvelle cuisine meal, he could fly to just about any city in the U.S. that intrigued him. In the course of these travels, he fell under the spell of Savannah, and moved there for eight years. Central to his story here is his acquaintance with Jim Williams, a Gatsby-like, newly moneyed antiques dealer, and Williams's sometime lover Danny Hansford, a 'walking streak of sex'&#151;a volatile, dangerous young hustler whose fatal shooting by Williams obsesses the city.<p>Other notable characters include Chablis, a show-stealing black drag queen; Joe Odom, cheerfully amoral impresario and restaurateur; Luther Driggers, inventor of the flea collar, who likes it to be known that he has a supply of poison so lethal that he could wipe out every person in the city if he chose to slip it into the water supply; and Minerva, a black occultist who works with roots and whom Williams hires to help deal with what the antiques dealer believes to be Hansford's vengeful ghost.<p>Showing a talent for penetrating any social barrier, Berendt gets himself invited to the tony Married Women's Club; the rigidly proper Black Debutantes' Ball (which Chablis crashes); the inner sanctum of power-lawyer Sonny Seiler; and one of Williams' fabled Christmas parties (the one for a mixed group; the author opts out of the following evening's 'bachelors-only' feast). The imprisonment and trial of Williams, and his surprising fate, form the narrative thread thatstitches together this crazy-quilt of oddballs, poseurs, snobs, sorceresses, and outlaws.  Stylish, brilliant, hilarious, and coolhearted.<P>

</div><a name="RGG"></a><h3>Reading Group Guide</h3><p>1. John Berendt describes Savannah as inward-turning, a &quot;semitropical terrarium&quot; (p. 28). What effect does this characteristic have on the life of the city and of its inhabitants? In what ways does Savannah differ from other cities or communities you know?</p><p>2. Eccentrics thrive in Berendt's Savannah. Does this mean that the people of Savannah are unusually tolerant? In what ways are they tolerant, and in what instances do they prove to be intolerant? How tolerant are they when it comes to the crossing of sexual, racial, or class lines?</p><p>3. Do you think that people would put up with Joe Odom and his countless misdemeanors in a city with a different character from Savannah? Might he end up in jail if he lived somewhere else?</p><p>4. How would you describe Jim Williams's character? Do you find him amusing? Sinister? How much sympathy do you have for him? Reading the book, did you hope for him to be acquitted? Why, or why not?</p><p>5. Some of Jim Williams' acquaintances think that the Nazi flag episode was insignificant; others do not. &quot;Nazi symbols are not totally bereft of meaning, &quot; says one man. &quot;They still carry a very clear message, even if they're displayed under the guise of `historic relics'&quot; (p. 178). Do you believe that Williams was being deliberately offensive when he displayed this flag? If so, why?</p><p>6. There was a tacit acceptance in Savannah of Jim Williams's homosexuality before the murder. How would you describe the shift in climate after the murder? Were people really surprised to hear about Williams's sexual practices? How did they adjust their attitudes?</p><p>7. After everything you have heard about Lee Adler, do you goalong with the general opinion people have of him in Savannah? Do you think that the reservations so many people hold about him spring from the fact that he is Jewish? Would his actions and behavior be more good-humoredly accepted if he did not happen to be Jewish?</p><p>8. Do you think that Danny's actions and violent scenes indicate that he was following a suicidal course? What were his real feelings towards Jim Williams? What was he trying to get out of him?</p><p>9. Is Chablis as frivolous a person as she likes to present herself as being? What does her argument with Burt at the nightclub tell you about her character?</p><p>10. Talking about the Oglethorpe Club types, Jim Williams says &quot;When people like that see somebody like me, who's never joined their silly pecking order and who's taken great risks and succeeded, they loathe that person. I have felt it many times&quot; (p. 237). Do you think that Williams is correct?</p><p>11. Black and white people's lives &quot;are more intermingled here than in New York, &quot; Berendt has said (USA Today 41594). &quot;I love the banter back and forth among whites and blacks. They don't mix socially that much, but there's a civility that's remarkable&quot; (Washington Post). Do you find that relations between the races in the Savannah that Berendt describes are healthier, or less healthy, than in other parts of America? What might the high black crime rate indicate about the city?</p><p>12. What does the black debutante ball tell you about the black community--or at least that part of the black community--in Savannah? Why is Chablis so scornful of the ball and the people there? Do you sympathize with her feelings?</p><p>13. At the St. Patrick's Day parade, the narrator observes that the wagon following the Confederate marchers contained &quot;a blue-clad Union soldier sprawled motionless on the floor of the wagon. It was a chilling tableau, the more so because it was meant to be surreptitious&quot; (p. 257). What does this say about attitudes in Savannah? Does the scene indicate that the passions roused by the Civil War are still alive there? Why did the marchers keep the tableau surreptitious?</p><p>14. What do you think the narrator's attitude is toward the voodoo that is practiced on Williams's behalf? Does he imply that it is of any value? How would you describe Minerva? Is she the sort of person you would expect to be practicing voodoo?</p><p>15. After the trial, Minerva says &quot;I saw it all: The boy fussed at him that night. Mr. Jim got angry and shot him. He lied to me, and he lied to the court&quot; (p. 380). Do you concur with Minerva's scenario?</p><p>16. How would you describe Savannah's feelings to tradition and to the past? Are these feelings characteristic of the South in general? How do they differ from those in other parts of the country?</p><p>17. One reader from Georgia has said of Berendt, &quot;I think he captured what it is to be Southern. He captured the not-talked-about way of life&quot; (USA Today 41594). If this is true, what would you say it is to be Southern? What does the South Berendt describes represent? Does it differ from stereotypes about the South?</p>
<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P>He was tall, about fifty, with darkly handsome, almost sinister features&#58; a neatly trimmed mustache, hair turning sliver at the temples, and eyes so black they were like the tinted windows of a sleek limousine - he could see out, but you couldn't see in. We were sitting in the living room of his Victorian house. It was a mansion, really, with fifteen-foot ceilings and large, well-proportioned rooms. A graceful spiral stairway rose from the center hall toward a domed skylight.<br>There was a ballroom on the second floor. It was Mercer House, one of the last of Savannah's great houses still in private hands. Together with the walled garden and the carriage house in back, it occupied an entire city block. If Mercer House was not quite the biggest private house in Savannah, it was certainly the most grandly furnished. Architectural Digest had devoted six pages to it. A book on the interiors of the world's great houses featured it alongside Sagamore Hill,<br>Biltmore, and Chartwell. Mercer House was the envy of house-proud Savannah. Jim Williams lived in it alone.<br><br>Williams was smoking a King Edward cigarillo. &quot;What I enjoy most,&quot; he said, &quot;is living like an aristocrat without the burden of having to be one. Blue bloods are so inbred and weak. All those generations of importance and grandeur to live up to. No wonder they lack ambition. I don't envy them. It's only the trappings of aristocracy that I find worthwhile - the fine furniture, the paintings, the sliver&#151;the very things they have to sell when the money runs out. And it always does. Then all they're left with is their lovely manners.&quot;<br><br>He spoke in a drawl as soft as velvet. The walls of his house were hung with portraits of European and American aristocrats - by Gainsborough, Hudson, Reynolds, Whistler. The provenance of his possessions traced back to dukes and duchesses, kings, queens, czars, emperors, and dictators. &quot;Anyhow,&quot; he said, &quot;royalty is better.&quot;<br><br>Williams tapped a cigar ash into a sliver ashtray. A dark gray tiger cat climbed up and settled in his lap. He stroked it gently. &quot;I know I'm apt to give the wrong impression, living the way I do. But I'm not trying to fool anyone. Years ago I was showing a group of visitors through the house and I noticed one man giving his wife the high sign. I saw him mouth the words 'old money!' The man was David Howard, the world's leading expert on armorial Chinese porcelain. I took him aside afterward and said, 'Mr. Howard, I was born in Gordon, Georgia. That's a little town near Macon. The biggest thing in Gordon is a chalk mine. My father was a barber, and my mother worked as a secretary for the mine.<br>My money - what there is of it - is about eleven years old.' Well, the man was completely taken aback. 'Do you know what made me think you were from an old family,' he said, 'apart from the portraits and the antiques? Those chairs over there. The needlework on the covers is unraveling. New money would mend it right away. Old money would leave it just as it is.' 'I know that,' I told him. 'Some of my best customers are old money.'&quot;<br><br>* <br>&bull; *<br><br>I had heard Jim Williams's name mentioned often during the six months I had lived in Savannah. The house was one reason,<br>son, but there were others. He was a successful dealer in antiques and restorer of old houses. He had been president of the Telfair Academy, the local art museum. His by-line had appeared in Antiques magazine, and the magazine's editor,<br>Wendell Garrett, spoke of him as a genius&#58; &quot;He has an extraordinary eye for finding stuff. He trusts his own judgment,<br>and he's willing to take chances. He'll hop on a plane and go anywhere to an auction - to New York, to London,<br>to Geneva. But at heart he's a southern chauvinist, very much a son of the region. I don't think he cares much for Yankees.&quot;<br><br>Williams had played an active role in the restoration of Savannah's historic district, starting in the mid-1950s. Georgia Fawcett, a longtime preservationist, recalled how difficult it had been to get people involved in saving downtown Savannah in those early days. &quot;The old part of town had become a slum,&quot; she said. &quot;The banks had red-lined the whole area. The great old houses were failing into ruin or being demolished to make way for gas stations and parking lots, and you couldn't borrow any money from the banks to go in and save them. Prostitutes strolled along the streets. Couples with children were afraid to live downtown, because it was considered dangerous.&quot; Mrs. Fawcett had been a member of a small group of genteel preservationists who had tried since the 1930s to stave off the gas stations and save the houses.<br>&quot;One thing we did do,&quot; she said. &quot;We got the bachelors interested.&quot;<br><br>Jim Williams was one of the bachelors. He bought a row of one-story brick tenements on East Congress Street, restored the whole row, and sold it. Soon he was buying, restoring, and selling dozens of houses all over downtown Savannah. Stories in the newspapers drew attention to his restorations, and his antiques business grew. He started going to Europe once a year on buying trips. He was discovered by society hostesses. The improvement in Williams'<br>fortunes paralleled the renaissance of Savannah's historic district. By the early 1970s, couples with children came back downtown, and the prostitutes moved over to Montgomery Street.<br><br>Feeling flush, Williams bought Cabbage Island, one of the sea islands that form an archipelago along the Georgia coast. Cabbage Island was a folly. It covered eighteen hundred acres, all but five of which lay under water at high tide.<br>He paid $5,000 for it in 1966. Old salts at the marina told him he had been duped&#58; Cabbage Island had been on the market for half that sum the year before. Five thousand dollars was a lot of money for a soggy piece of real estate you couldn't even build a house on. But a few months later phosphates were discovered under several coastal islands, including Cabbage Island. Williams sold out to Kerr-McGee of Oklahoma for $660,000. Several property owners on neighboring islands laughed at him for jumping at the bait too quickly. They held out for a higher price. Weeks later,<br>the state of Georgia outlawed drilling along the coast. The phosphate deal was dead, and as it turned out, Williams was the only one who had sold in time. His after-tax profit was a half million dollars.<br><br>Now he bought far grander houses. One of them was Armstrong House, a monumental Italian Renaissance palazzo directly across Bull Street from the staid Oglethorpe Club. Armstrong House dwarfed the Oglethorpe Club, and,<br>according to local lore, that was very much its purpose. George Armstrong, a shipping magnate, was said to have built the house in 1919 in response to being blackballed by the club. Although that story was not, in fact, true, Armstrong House was a lion of a house. It gloated and glowered and loomed. It even had a curving colonnade that reached out like a giant paw as if to swat the Oglethorpe Club off its high horse across the street.<br><br>The outrageous magnificence of Armstrong House appealed to Williams and to his growing appetite for grandeur.<br>He was not a member of the Oglethorpe Club. Bachelors from middle Georgia who sold antiques were not likely to be asked to join - not that it bothered him. He installed his antiques shop in Armstrong House for a year and then sold the house to the law firm of Bouhan, Williams and Levy and went on about the business of living like, if not being, an aristocrat. He made more frequent buying trips to Europe&#151;in style now, on the QE2&#151;and sent back whole container loads of important paintings and fine English furniture. He bought his first pieces of Faberge. Williams was gaining stature in Savannah, to the irritation of certain blue bloods. &quot;How does it feel to be nouveau riche?&quot; he was asked on one occasion. &quot;It's the riche that counts,&quot; Williams answered. Having said that, he bought Mercer House.<br><br>Mercer House had been empty for more than ten years. It stood at the west end of Monterey Square, the most elegant of Savannah's many tree-shaded squares. It was an Italianate mansion of red brick with tall, arched windows set off by ornate ironwork balconies. It sat back from the street, aloof behind its apron of lawn and its cast-iron fence, not so much looking out on the square as presiding over it. The most recent occupants of the house, the Shriners, had used it as the Alee Temple. They had hung a neon-lit scimitar over the front door and driven around inside on motorcycles. Williams set about restoring the house to something greater than its original elegance. When work was completed in<br>1970, he gave a black-tie Christmas party and invited the cream of Savannah society. On the night of his party, every window of Mercer House was ablaze with candlelight; every room had sparkling chandeliers. Clusters of onlookers stood outside watching the smart arrivals and staring in amazement at the beautiful house that had been dark for so long.<br>A pianist played cocktail music on the grand piano downstairs; an organist played classical pieces in the ballroom above. Butlers in white jackets circulated with silver trays. Ladies in long gowns moved up and down the spiral stairs in rivers of satin and silk chiffon. Old Savannah was dazzled.<br><br>The party soon became a permanent fixture on Savannah's social calendar. Williams always scheduled it to occur at the climax of the winter season - the night before the Cotillion's debutante ball. That Friday night became known as the night of Jim Williams' Christmas party. It was the Party of the Year, and this was no small accomplishment for Williams.<br>&quot;You have to understand,&quot; a sixth-generation Savannahian declared, &quot;Savannah takes its parties very seriously.<br>This is a town where gentlemen own their own white tie and tails. We don't rent them. So it's quite a tribute to Jim that he has been able to make so prominent a place for himself on the social scene, in spite of not being a native Savannahian and being a bachelor.&quot;<br><br>The food at Williams' parties was always provided by Savannah's most sought-after cateress, Lucille Wright. Mrs.<br>Wright was a light-skinned black woman whose services were so well regarded that Savannah's leading hostesses had been known to change the date of a party if she was not available. Mrs. Wright's touch was easy to spot. Guests would nibble on a cheese straw or eat a marinated shrimp or take a bite of a tomato finger sandwich and smile knowingly.<br>&quot;Lucille . . . !&quot; they would say, and nothing more needed to be said. (Lucille Wright's tomato sandwiches were never soggy. She patted the tomato slices with paper towels first. That was just one of her many secrets.) Her clients held her in high esteem. &quot;She's a real lady,&quot; they often said, and you could tell from the way they said it that they considered that high praise for a black woman. Mrs. Wright admired her patrons in return, although she did confide that Savannah's hostesses, even the rich ones, tended to come to her and say, &quot;Now, Lucille, I want a nice party, but I don't want to spend too much money.&quot; Jim Williams was not like that. &quot;He likes things done in the grand style,&quot; Mrs. Wright said,<br>&quot;and he's very liberal with his money. Very. Very. He always tells me, 'Lucille, I'm having two hundred people and I want low-country food and plenty of it. I don't want to run out. Get what you need. I don't care what it costs.'&quot;<br><br>Jim Williams' Christmas party was, in the words of the <b>Georgia Gazette</b>, the party that Savannah socialites &quot;lived for.&quot; Or lived without, for Williams enjoyed changing his guest list from year to year. He wrote names on file cards and arranged them in two stacks&#58; an In stack and an Out stack. He shunted the cards from one stack to the other and made no secret of it. If a person had displeased him in any way during the year, that person would do penance come Christmas. &quot;My Out stack,&quot; he once told the <b>Gazette</b>, &quot;is an inch thick.&quot;<br><br>* <br>&bull; *<br><br><br><br>An early-evening mist had turned the view of Monterey Square into a soft-focus stage set with pink azaleas billowing beneath a tattered valance of live oaks and Spanish moss. The pale marble pedestal of the Pulaski monument glowed hazily in the background. A copy of the book <b>At Home in Savannah&#151;Great Interiors</b> lay on Williams' coffee table. I had seen the same book on several other coffee tables in Savannah, but here the effect was surreal&#58; The cover photograph was of this very room.<br><br>For the better part of an hour, Williams had taken me on a tour of Mercer House and his antiques shop, which was quartered in the carriage house. In the ballroom, he played the pipe organ, first a piece by Bach, then &quot;I Got Rhythm.&quot; Finally, to demonstrate the organ's deafening power, he played a passage from Cesar Franck's &quot;Piece Heroique.&quot; &quot;When my neighbors let their dogs howl all night,&quot; said Williams,<br>&quot;this is what they get in return.&quot; In the dining room, he showed me his royal treasures&#58; Queen Alexandra's silverware,<br>the Duchess of Richmond's porcelain, and a silver service for sixty that had belonged to a Russian grand duke.<br>The coat of arms from the door of Napoleon's coronation carriage hung on the wall in the study. Here and there around the house lay Faberge objects&#151;cigarette cases, ornaments, jewel boxes - the trappings of aristocracy, nobility,<br>royalty. As we moved from room to room, tiny red lights flickered in electronic recognition of our presence.<br><br>Williams was wearing gray slacks and a blue cotton shirt turned up at the sleeves. His heavy black shoes and thick rubber soles were oddly out of place in the elegance of Mercer House, but practical; Williams spent several hours a day on his feet restoring antique furniture in his basement workshop. His hands were raw and callused, but they had been scrubbed clean of stains and grease.<br><br>&quot;If there's a single trait common to all Savannahians,&quot; he was saying, &quot;it's their love of money and their unwillingness to spend it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then who buys those high-priced antiques I just saw in your shop?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;That's exactly my point,&quot; he said. &quot;People from out town. Atlanta, New Orleans, New York. That's where I most of my business. When I find an especially fine piece furniture I send a photograph of it to a New York dealer.<br>don't waste time trying to sell it here in Savannah. It's not that people in Savannah aren't rich enough. It's just that they're very cheap. I'll give you an example.<br><br>&quot;There's a woman here, a grande dame at the very apex of society and one of the richest people in the Southeast, let alone Savannah. She owns a copper mine. She built a big house in an exclusive part of town, a replica of a famous Louisiana plantation house with huge white columns and curved stairs. You can see it from the water. Everybody goes,<br>'Oooo, look!' when they pass by it. I adore her. She's been like a mother to me. But she's the cheapest woman who ever lived! Some years ago she ordered a pair of iron gates for her house. They were designed and built especially for her. But when they were delivered she pitched a fit, said they were horrible, said they were filth. 'Take them away,' she said, 'I never want to see them again!' Then she tore up the bill, which was for $1,400 - a fair amount of money in those days.<br><br>&quot;The foundry took the gates back, but they didn't know what to do with them. After all, there wasn't much demand for a pair of ornamental gates exactly that size. The only thing they could do was to sell the iron for its scrap value.<br>So they cut the price from $1,400 to $190. Naturally, the following day the woman sent a man over to the foundry with $190, and today those gates are hanging on her gateposts where they were originally designed to go. That's pure Savannah. And that's what I mean by cheap. You mustn't be taken in by the moonlight and magnolias. There's more to Savannah than that. Things can get very murky.&quot; Williams stroked his cat and tapped another ash into the ashtray.<br><br>&quot;We had a judge back in the nineteen-thirties, a member of one of the city's leading families. He lived one square over from here in a big house with tall white columns. His older son was going around town with a gangster's girlfriend. The gangster warned him to stop, but the judge's son kept right at it. One night the doorbell rang and when the judge opened the door, he found his son lying on the porch bleeding to death with his private parts tucked under his lapel.<br>The doctors sewed his genitals back on, but the body rejected them and he died. The next day, the headline in the paper read FALL FROM PORCH PROVES FATAL. Most members of that family still deny the murder ever happened, but the victim's sister tells me it's true. <br><br>&quot;It doesn't end there. The same judge had another son. This one lived in a house on Whitaker Street. He and his wife used to fight. I mean really go at it, throw each other across rooms and that sort of thing. During one of those fights, their three-year-old daughter came downstairs unnoticed, just when the husband was getting ready to fling his wife into a marble-topped table. When the woman hit the table, it overturned and crushed the little girl. They didn't find out about it until an hour later when they were picking up the debris from the fight. As far as the family is concerned,<br>that incident never happened either.&quot;<br><br>Williams picked up the decanter of Madeira And refilled our glasses. &quot;Drinking Madeira is a great Savannah ritual,<br>you know,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a celebration of failure, actually. The British sent whole shiploads of grapevines over from Madeira in the eighteenth century in hopes of turning Georgia into a wine-producing colony. Savannah's on the same latitude as Madeira. Well, the vines died, but Savannah never lost its taste for Madeira. Or any other kind of liquor for that matter. Prohibition didn't even slow things down here. Everybody had a way of getting liquor, even little old ladies. Especially the old ladies. A bunch of them bought a Cuban rumrunner and ran it back and forth between here and Cuba.&quot;<br><br>Williams sipped his Madeira. &quot;One of those ladies died just a few months ago. Old Mrs. Morton. She was a marvel.<br>She did exactly as she pleased all her life, God bless her. Her son came home for Christmas vacation one year and brought his college roommate with him. Mama and the college roommate fell in love; the roommate moved into the master bedroom with her; Daddy moved into the guest bedroom, and the son went back to college and never came home again. From then on, Mr. and Mrs. Morton and the roommate lived in that house under those circumstances until the old man died. They kept up appearances and pretended nothing at all outrageous had happened. Mama's young lover served as her chauffeur. Whenever he dropped her off and picked her up at her bridge parties, the other ladies would peer out at them through the venetian blinds. But they never let on that they were interested, because nobody,<br>nobody ever mentioned his name in her presence.&quot;<br><br>Williams fell silent for a moment, no doubt reflecting upon the recently departed Mrs. Morton. Through the open window, Monterey Square was quiet except for the rasp of a cricket and the passing, now and then, of a car unhurriedly negotiating the turns around the square.<br><br>&quot;What do you suppose would happen,&quot; I asked, &quot;if the tour guides told that sort of story to their busloads of tourists?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not possible,&quot; said Williams. &quot;They keep it very prim and proper.&quot;<br><br>I told Williams that as I was coming up the walk earlier I had heard the guide on one of the tour buses talking about this house.<br><br>&quot;Bless their boring little hearts,&quot; said Williams. &quot;What did the guide say?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She said that the house was the birthplace of the famous songwriter Johnny Mercer, the man who wrote 'Moon River,' 'I Wanna Be Around,' 'Too Marvelous for Words,' and other standards.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wrong, but not completely off base,&quot; said Williams. &quot;What else?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That last year Jacqueline Onassis offered to buy the house and everything in it for two million dollars.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The guide gets C minus for accuracy,&quot; said Williams. &quot;And now, I'll tell you what really happened&#58;<br><br><br><br>&quot;Construction of the house was begun in 1860 by the Confederate general Hugh Mercer, Johnny Mercer's great-grandfather.<br>It was unfinished when the Civil War broke out and after the war, General Mercer was imprisoned and tried for the murder of two army deserters. He was eventually acquitted, largely on the testimony of his son, and released from a jail a broken and very angry man. He sold the house, and the new owners completed it. So none of the Mercers ever lived here, including Johnny. Late in his life, though, Johnny used to drop in when he was in town. In fact, he taped a Mike Douglas show in the front yard. He once offered to buy the house, but I told him, 'Johnny, you don't need it, you'll end up playing houseboy to it just as I have.' And that's as close as he came to ever living here.&quot;<br><br>Williams leaned back and sent a thin stream of cigar smoke ceilingward. &quot;I'll come to Jacqueline Onassis in a moment,&quot;<br>he said, &quot;but first I want to let you in on another piece of history that the tour guides never mention. It's an incident I call 'Flag Day.' It happened a couple of years ago.&quot; <br><br>He stood up and went over to the window. &quot;Monterey Square is lovely,&quot; he said. &quot;In my opinion, it's the most beautiful of all the squares in Savannah. The architecture, the trees, the monument, the way it all fits together. Moviemakers love it. Something like twenty feature films have been shot in Savannah in the past six years, and Monterey Square is one of their favorite shooting locations.<br><br>&quot;Every time filming begins the town goes wild. Everybody wants to be an extra and meet the stars and watch from the sidelines. The mayor and the city councilmen think it's wonderful because the film companies will spend money here,<br>and Savannah will become famous, and that will help tourism.<br><br>&quot;But it really isn't so wonderful at all. The moviemakers pay local extras the minimum wage, and Savannah doesn't get publicity after all, because the audiences usually haven't the vaguest idea where the movies have been shot. In fact, the costs to Savannah turn out to be greater than the return if you add up the overtime pay for sanitation men and police and the disruption of traffic. And the film crews are invari-ably rude. They leave piles of litter. They destroy shrubbery. They trample the grass. One crew even cut down a palm tree across the square, because it didn't happen to suit them.<br><br>&quot;Well, the rudest bunch of all came to town a couple of years ago to film a CBS made-for-TV movie about the assas-sination of Abraham Lincoln. They selected Monterey Square for an important outdoor scene, but naturally we were not consulted. The night before filming was to begin, the police went around and abruptly ordered all of us to move our cars out of the square and not to enter or exit our houses between ten in the morning and five that afternoon. The film crew then dumped eight truckloads of dirt onto the street and spread it around to make it look like the unpaved streets of 1865. The next morning we awoke to find the square full of horses and wagons and ladies in hoopskirts and a thick coating of dust all over everything. It was intol-erable. The cameras were in the middle of the square aimed directly at this house.<br><br>&quot;Several of my neighbors asked me, as a founder and past president of the Downtown Neighborhood Association, to do something about it. I went out and asked the producer to make a thousand-dollar contribution to the Humane Society to show his good intentions. He said he would think it over and get back to me by noon.<br><br>&quot;Noon came and went. The producer never responded. In-stead, the cameras began to roll. I decided to ruin his shot, and this is how I did it.&quot;<br><br>Williams opened a cabinet to the left of the window and took out a bolt of red cloth. He held it up over his head and unfurled it with a snap of his wrist. It was an eight-foot Nazi banner.<br><br>&quot;I draped this over the balcony outside the window,&quot; he said. He held the banner up so I could get a good look at the big black swastika against a circle of white on a field of bright red.<br><br>&quot;I bet that stopped the shooting,&quot; I said.<br><br>&quot;Yes, but only temporarily,&quot; he said. &quot;The cameraman switched to the other side of the house, so I moved the flag to the window in the study. They eventually got the shot they wanted, but at least I made my point.&quot;<br><br>Williams rolled up the banner and put it back in the cab-inet. &quot;The furor it caused was something I hadn't expected. The Savannah Morning News splashed the story across its front page, complete with photographs. They wrote vituper-ative editorials and published angry letters. The wire services picked it up too, and so did the television network evening news.<br><br>&quot;I found myself having to explain that, no, I was not a Nazi and that I had used the flag to create a time warp in or-der to stop some very inconsiderate filmmakers, who were not Jewish as far as I knew. But I did make one terrible over-sight. I had forgotten that the Temple Mickve Israel syna-gogue is located directly across the square. The rabbi wrote me a letter asking how I happened to have a Nazi flag handy. I wrote back saying my uncle Jesse had brought it back as a trophy from the Second World War. I also told him I collected relics of all sorts of fallen empires and that the flag and a few other World War Two items were simply part of that group.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then I wasn't mistaken,&quot; I said. &quot;That was a Nazi dagger I saw on a table in the rear parlor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have several,&quot; said Williams, &quot;plus a few sidearms and a hood ornament from a Nazi staff car. That's about the ex-tent of it, though. Artifacts of Hitler's regime are not popu-lar, but they do have historic value. Most people understand that point and know there was nothing political about my protest. The firestorm abated after a couple of weeks, but every so often I encounter a smoldering ember in the form of glaring eyes or people crossing the street to avoid me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I gather you haven't been ostracized.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not at all. Six months after Flag Day, Jacqueline Onassis came to call.&quot;<br><br>Williams crossed the room and lifted the lid of a slant-top desk. &quot;Twice a year,&quot; he said, &quot;Christie's auction house has Faberg&#233; sales in Geneva. Last year, the star item in the sale was an exquisite little jade box. It had been widely adver-tised, and there was a lot of excitement about it. The man in charge of those sales was Geza von Habsburg; he'd be archduke of the Austro-Hungarian Empire today if it still ex-isted. Geza's a friend of mine. I've attended those sales for years. Naturally, I flew over for this one, and I said, 'Geza, I'm here to buy that little box.' Geza laughed and said, 'Jim, quite a number of people are here to buy that little box.' I had visions of having to bid against Malcolm Forbes and his ilk, but I thought at least I'd have fun driving up the price. So I said, 'Well, Geza, let's put it this way&#58; If somebody out-bids me and buys that box they're gonna, by God, know they bought a box!' The bidding started at the highest esti-mate. I finally bought the box for seventy thousand dollars. Then I flew back over the Atlantic on the Concorde and had a champagne cocktail with the little box sitting on my linen&#151;covered tray.<br><br>&quot;The very next morning, I was down in my basement workshop restoring furniture, jet-lagged and unshaven, when the doorbell rang. I sent one of my assistants, Barry Thomas, up to answer it. He came running back downstairs all out of breath and said a tour guide was at the door and wanted to know if I would show Jacqueline Onassis through the house. I thought, 'This is a bunch of bull,' but I came up anyway and there was the tour guide, and indeed she had Mrs. Onassis waiting in the car.<br><br>&quot;I asked her to drive around the block a few times and give me a chance to shave and get the house pulled together. While she did that, I got myself ready and told the boys to do what we call a tour-of-homes lighting. It's a set routine that takes a full ten minutes of turning on lamps, opening shutters, emptying ashtrays and clearing away newspapers. Just as we were finishing, the doorbell rang again, and there was Mrs. Onassis and her friend Maurice Tempelsman. 'I'm awfully sorry I sent you away before,' I said, 'but I just got back last night from the Faberg&#233; sale in Geneva.' With that, Mr. Tempelsman said, 'Who bought the box?' I said, 'Won't you come in and see?' Without another word, he took Mrs. Onassis by the arm and said, 'There it is. I told you we should have bought it.'&quot;<br><br>Williams handed me the box. It was a rich deep green, about four inches square. The top was covered with a bril-liant latticework of diamonds punctuated with cabochon ru-bies. In the center, a white oval enamel medallion bore the cipher of Nicholas II in diamonds and gold.<br><br>&quot;They were in the house an hour or so,&quot; said Williams. &quot;They looked at everything. We went upstairs, and I played the pipe organ, and then we all played roulette. They were completely charming. Tempelsman had what I call a topside dye job. You take a man and dip him bottom side up in hair dye and stop right at the ears. He was an interesting man, very knowledgeable about antiques. In fact, they both were. They'd been traveling down the coast on his yacht, but Mrs. Onassis was very down-to-earth. She was wearing a white linen suit and didn't even bother brushing the dust off her chair when we sat down in the garden. She invited me to come visit her in her 'hovel' the next time I came to New York. When they left, she asked how to get to the nearest Burger King.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What about offering to buy the house for two million dollars?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;She did nothing as crass as that, but she apparently told Tempelsman in front of the tour guide&#151;who reported it to the newspapers, of course&#151;that she wished she owned the house and everything in it. 'But not Jim Williams,' she said, 'I couldn't afford him.'&quot;<br><br>I ran my hands over the Faberg&#233; box. The lid swung smoothly on its hinges. The gold clasp fastened with a muted click. As I gazed at this dazzling object, I was only half-aware of a key turning in the front door of Mercer House and of footsteps approaching in the entrance hall. Suddenly, a sharp voice cut the air. <br><br>&quot;Goddammit! Goddamn bitch!&quot;<br><br>A blond boy stood in the doorway. He appeared to be about nineteen or twenty. He was wearing blue jeans and a sleeveless black T-shirt with the words FUCK YOU printed in white across the front. He was trembling with barely con-trolled fury. His sapphire-blue eyes were blazing.<br><br>&quot;What seems to be the problem, Danny?&quot; Williams asked calmly, without rising from his chair.<br><br>&quot;Bonnie! Goddamn bitch. She stood me up! She's runnin' around at all the southside bars. Dammit! I ain't takin' her shit no more!&quot;<br><br>The boy grabbed a vodka bottle from the table and filled a crystal glass to the brim. He gulped it down. His arms were tattooed&#151;a Confederate flag on one arm, a marijuana plant on the other.<br><br>&quot;Get hold of yourself now, Danny,&quot; Williams said, speak-ing deliberately. &quot;Just tell me what happened.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe I was a few minutes late! I got throwed off in my timing. So what! Shit! Her girlfriend said she left 'cause I wasn't there when I said I'd be.&quot; He glared at Williams. &quot;Gimme twenty dollars! I need the money. I'm pissed off!&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you need it for?&quot;<br><br>&quot;None of your goddamn business! I need to get fucked up tonight, if you really wanna know. That's what!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think you've already accomplished that, Sport.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I ain't anywhere near fucked up enough yet!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now, Danny, don't go doing that and driving your car. You'll get arrested for sure if you do. You've already got charges against you from the last time you got, quote, fucked up. They're really gonna nail you this time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don't give a goddamn about you or Bonnie or the god-damn police!&quot;<br><br>With that, the boy turned and abruptly left the room. The front door slammed. Outside, a car door opened and closed. A sharp, prolonged squeal of tires pierced the evening still-ness. There was another squeal as the car rounded the cor-ner of Monterey Square, then another as it turned again and sped down Bull Street. Then all was quiet.<br><br>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; said Williams. He got up and poured himself a drink, not Madeira this time but straight vodka. Then si-lently, almost imperceptibly, he released a sigh and allowed his shoulders to relax.<br><br>I looked down and saw that I was still holding the Faberg&#233; box. I was clutching it so tightly I was afraid for a moment I might have dislodged a jewel or two from the top. It seemed intact. I handed it back to Williams.<br><br>&quot;That was Danny Hansford,&quot; he said. &quot;He works for me part-time refinishing furniture in my workshop.&quot;<br><br>Williams studied the end of his cigar. He was calm, controlled.<br><br>&quot;This is not the first time something like this has hap-pened,&quot; he said. &quot;I have an idea how it will end up. Later to-night, about three-thirty, the telephone will ring. It'll be Danny. He'll be charming and sweet-natured. He'll say, 'Hey, Jim! This is Danny. I'm real sorry to wake you up. Boy, did I fuck up tonight! Ma-a-a-an, did I make some big mis-takes!' And I'll say, 'Well, Danny, what happened this time?' And he'll say, 'I'm callin' from the jailhouse. Yeah, they put me in here again. But I ain't done nothin' wrong. I was goin' down Abercorn Street, see if I could find Bonnie, and I burned a little rubber and turned left real quick, and there was this goddamn police car! Blue lights, sirens. Man, I'm in trouble. Hey, Jim? Think you could come down and get me out?' And I'll say, 'Danny, it's late, I'm tired of this. Why don't you just cool it and relax yourself tonight. In jail.'<br><br>&quot;Now, Danny won't like this one bit, but he won't lose his cool. Not now. He'll keep it calm. He'll say, 'I know what you mean, and you're right. I oughta stay in here the rest of my goddamn life. It's been a messed-up life anyhow.' He'll be working on my sympathy now. 'It's okay, Jim,' he'll say. 'Just leave me here. Don't worry about it. Hell, I don't even care. I hope I didn't get you upset. Hope you can get back to sleep all right. See you later.'<br><br><br><br>&quot;Inside, Danny will be seething because I won't come right down there. He won't show it, though, because he knows I'm the only one who'll help him. He knows I'll call the bonds-man and tell them to go get him out, and they will. But I won't do that until morning, after the drugs have worn off.&quot;<br><br>Williams gave no outward sign that he was at all embar-rassed by the human tornado that had just passed through his house.<br><br>&quot;Danny has two distinct personalities,&quot; he said. &quot;He can switch from one to the other like turning the pages of a book.&quot; Williams was speaking about Danny with calm de-tachment, just as he had spoken earlier about the Waterford crystal chandelier in the dining room, the portrait by Jere-miah Theus in the parlor, and the judge's son and the gang-ster's moll. But he did not address the most curious question of all&#58; Danny's presence in Mercer House and the fact that he apparently had the run of it. The incongruity was star-tling. Perhaps it registered on my face, because Williams of-fered something of an explanation.<br><br>&quot;I have hypoglycemia,&quot; he said, &quot;and lately I've been blacking out. Danny stays here sometimes to baby-sit me when I'm not feeling well.&quot;<br><br>It may have been the Madeira, or the atmosphere of frank-ness that Williams had inspired with his stories&#151;at any rate, I felt free to observe that blacking out alone might be pref-erable to having this person running loose in the house. Wil-liams laughed. &quot;Actually, I think Danny may be improving a little.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Improving? Over what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Two weeks ago, we had a similar scene, but it ended a bit more dramatically. Danny was agitated that time because his best friend had made a disparaging remark about his car, and his girlfriend had refused to marry him. Danny came back to the house and carried on about it, and before I knew what was happening, he had stomped a small table, thrown a bronze lamp against the wall, and slammed a cut-glass wa-ter pitcher on the floor with so much force it made a perma-nent imprint on the heart-pine floorboards. But he wasn't through yet. He took one of my German Lugers and fired a bullet into the floor upstairs. Then he ran out the front door and fired another shot into Monterey Square, trying to knock out a streetlight.<br><br>&quot;Naturally, I called the police. But when Danny heard the sirens, he tossed the gun into the bushes, ran indoors, flew up the stairs, and jumped into bed with all his clothes on. The cops were no more than a minute behind him, but by the time they got upstairs, Danny was pretending to be fast asleep. When they 'woke' him, he put on an act of confusion and denied he'd broken anything or shot any guns. But the police noticed tiny drops of blood on his arms from the little splinters of glass that had shot up when he smashed the pitcher on the floor. So they took him off to jail. I figured the longer I left him there the madder he'd get, so the next morning I dropped the charges and got him out.&quot; <br><br>I did not ask the obvious question&#58; Why do you have any-thing to do with him? Instead, I asked a question of more immediate concern&#58; &quot;You said Danny had fired 'one of' your German Lugers. How many do you have?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Several,&quot; said Williams. &quot;I need them for security. I'm here by myself a lot, and I've had a couple of robberies. The second robbery was pulled off by a man who was armed with a submachine gun, and I was asleep upstairs at the time. That's when I installed the alarm system. It works fine when I'm out of the house or upstairs, but I can't throw the switch when I'm walking around down here on the main floor, because it'll summon the police. So I keep pistols in strategic places. There's a Luger in the rear library, another in a desk drawer in my office, a third in the Irish linen press in the hall, and a Smith and Wesson in the living room. I've also got a shotgun and three or four rifles upstairs. The pistols are loaded.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That's four loaded pistols,&quot; I said.<br><br>&quot;There's a risk, I know. But I'm a gambler. I have been all my life. You have to be if you deal in antiques and restore houses and go into debt for all of it as I have. But when I gamble I know how to improve the odds. Come, I'll show you.&quot;<br><br>Williams led me over to a small backgammon table. He removed the backgammon board and replaced it with an-other plain board lined with green felt.<br><br>&quot;I believe in mind control,&quot; he said. &quot;I think you can influ-ence events by mental concentration. I've invented a game called Psycho Dice. It's very simple. You take four dice and call out four numbers between one and six&#151;for example, a four, a three, and two sixes. Then you throw the dice, and if any of your numbers come up, you leave those dice stand-ing on the board. You continue to roll the remaining dice until all the dice are sitting on the board, showing your set of numbers. You're eliminated if you roll three times in suc-cession without getting any of the numbers you need. The object is to get all four numbers in the fewest rolls.&quot;<br><br>Williams was sure he could improve the odds by sheer concentration. &quot;Dice have six sides,&quot; he said, &quot;so you have a one-in-six chance of getting your number when you throw them. If you do any better than that, you beat the law of av-erages. Concentration definitely helps. That's been proved. Back in the nineteen-thirties, Duke University did a study with a machine that could throw dice. First they had it throw dice when nobody was in the building, and the num-bers came up strictly according to the law of averages. Then they put a man in the next room and had him concentrate on various numbers to see if that would beat the odds. It did. Then they put him in the same room, still concentrat-ing, and the machine beat the odds again, by an even wider margin. When the man rolled the dice himself, using a cup, he did better still. When he finally rolled the dice with his bare hand, he did best of all.&quot;<br><br>From the few rounds we played, I could not say whether Psycho Dice really worked. Williams had no doubt that it did. He saw proof of it at every turn. When I needed a five and rolled a two, he proclaimed, &quot;Aha! You know what's on the other side of a two, don't you? Five!&quot;<br><br>I could not let this pass. &quot;If we'd been betting, I would have lost anyway, wouldn't I?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but look how close you came. You see, the same concentration that makes Psycho Dice work can make most things in life work. I've never been sick a day in my life ex-cept for a common cold once in a while. I just can't be both-ered. I don't have the time. Being sick is a luxury. I concentrate on being well. Danny didn't do more than let off steam tonight, because I cooled him down. I was concentrating on that.&quot;<br><br>I was tempted not to let that remark pass, either. But it was late. I rose to leave. &quot;Isn't it possible that other people will turn their mental energy on you?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;They try to all the time,&quot; Williams said with a wry smile. &quot;I'm told a lot of people pray fervently night after night that I'll invite them to my Christmas parties.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can understand that,&quot; I said. &quot;From what I've heard, it's the best party in Savannah.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'll invite you to the next one, and you can judge for yourself.&quot; Williams fixed me with an impenetrable look. &quot;You know I have two Christmas parties, not just one. Both are black-tie. The first party is the famous one. It's the one that gets written up in the newspapers, the one the high and mighty of Savannah come to. The second party is the next night. It's the one the papers never write about. It's . . . for gentlemen only. Which party would you like to be invited to?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The one,&quot; I said, &quot;least likely to involve gunfire.&quot;<br><br><br><a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><P>
                AN EVENING
              IN MERCER HOUSE
<P>
He was tall, about fifty, with darkly handsome, almost sinister
features: a neatly trimmed mustache, hair turning sliver
at the temples, and eyes so black they were like the tinted
windows of a sleek limousine - he could see out, but you
couldn't see in. We were sitting in the living room of his Victorian
house. It was a mansion, really, with fifteen-foot ceilings
and large, well-proportioned rooms. A graceful spiral
stairway rose from the center hall toward a domed skylight.
There was a ballroom on the second floor. It was Mercer
House, one of the last of Savannah's great houses still in private
hands. Together with the walled garden and the carriage
house in back, it occupied an entire city block. If Mercer
House was not quite the biggest private house in Savannah,
it was certainly the most grandly furnished. Architectural Digest
had devoted six pages to it. A book on the interiors of
the world's great houses featured it alongside Sagamore Hill,
Biltmore, and Chartwell. Mercer House was the envy of
house-proud Savannah. Jim Williams lived in it alone.
<P>
   Williams was smoking a King Edward cigarillo. "What I
enjoy most," he said, "is living like an aristocrat without the
burden of having to be one. Blue bloods are so inbred and
weak. All those generations of importance and grandeur to
live up to. No wonder they lack ambition. I don't envy
them. It's only the trappings of aristocracy that I find
worthwhile - the fine furniture, the paintings, the sliver - the
very things they have to sell when the money runs out. And
it always does. Then all they're left with is their lovely
manners."
<P>
   He spoke in a drawl as soft as velvet. The walls of his
house were hung with portraits of European and American
aristocrats - by Gainsborough, Hudson, Reynolds, Whistler.
The provenance of his possessions traced back to dukes and
duchesses, kings, queens, czars, emperors, and dictators.
"Anyhow," he said, "royalty is better."
<P>
   Williams tapped a cigar ash into a sliver ashtray. A dark
gray tiger cat climbed up and settled in his lap. He stroked
it gently. "I know I'm apt to give the wrong impression, living
the way I do. But I'm not trying to fool anyone. Years
ago I was showing a group of visitors through the house and
I noticed one man giving his wife the high sign. I saw him
mouth the words 'old money!' The man was David Howard,
the world's leading expert on armorial Chinese porcelain. I
took him aside afterward and said, 'Mr. Howard, I was born
in Gordon, Georgia. That's a little town near Macon. The
biggest thing in Gordon is a chalk mine. My father was a
barber, and my mother worked as a secretary for the mine.
My money - what there is of it - is about eleven years old.'
Well, the man was completely taken aback. 'Do you know
what made me think you were from an old family,' he said,
'apart from the portraits and the antiques? Those chairs over
there. The needlework on the covers is unraveling. New
money would mend it right away. Old money would leave it
just as it is.' 'I know that,' I told him. 'Some of my best customers
are old money.'"
<P>
I had heard Jim Williams's name mentioned often during the
six months I had lived in Savannah. The house was one reason,
son, but there were others. He was a successful dealer in antiques
and restorer of old houses. He had been president of
the Telfair Academy, the local art museum. His by-line had
appeared in Antiques magazine, and the magazine's editor,
Wendell Garrett, spoke of him as a genius: "He has an extraordinary
eye for finding stuff. He trusts his own judgment,
and he's willing to take chances. He'll hop on a plane
and go anywhere to an auction - to New York, to London,
to Geneva. But at heart he's a southern chauvinist, very
much a son of the region. I don't think he cares much for
Yankees."
<P>
   Williams had played an active role in the restoration of
Savannah's historic district, starting in the mid-1950s. Georgia
Fawcett, a longtime preservationist, recalled how difficult
it had been to get people involved in saving downtown Savannah
in those early days. "The old part of town had become
a slum," she said. "The banks had red-lined the whole
area. The great old houses were failing into ruin or being demolished
to make way for gas stations and parking lots, and
you couldn't borrow any money from the banks to go in and
save them. Prostitutes strolled along the streets. Couples
with children were afraid to live downtown, because it was
considered dangerous." Mrs. Fawcett had been a member of
a small group of genteel preservationists who had tried since
the 1930s to stave off the gas stations and save the houses.
"One thing we did do," she said. "We got the bachelors
interested."
<P>
   Jim Williams was one of the bachelors. He bought a row
of one-story brick tenements on East Congress Street, restored
the whole row, and sold it. Soon he was buying, restoring,
and selling dozens of houses all over downtown
Savannah. Stories in the newspapers drew attention to his
restorations, and his antiques business grew. He started going
to Europe once a year on buying trips. He was discovered
by society hostesses. The improvement in Williams'
fortunes paralleled the renaissance of Savannah's historic district.
By the early 1970s, couples with children came back
downtown, and the prostitutes moved over to Montgomery
Street.
<P>
   Feeling flush, Williams bought Cabbage Island, one of the
sea islands that form an archipelago along the Georgia
coast. Cabbage Island was a folly. It covered eighteen hundred
acres, all but five of which lay under water at high tide.
He paid $5,000 for it in 1966. Old salts at the marina told
him he had been duped: Cabbage Island had been on the
market for half that sum the year before. Five thousand dollars
was a lot of money for a soggy piece of real estate you
couldn't even build a house on. But a few months later
phosphates were discovered under several coastal islands, including
Cabbage Island. Williams sold out to Kerr-McGee
of Oklahoma for $660,000. Several property owners on
neighboring islands laughed at him for jumping at the bait
too quickly. They held out for a higher price. Weeks later,
the state of Georgia outlawed drilling along the coast. The
phosphate deal was dead, and as it turned out, Williams
was the only one who had sold in time. His after-tax profit
was a half million dollars.
<P>
   Now he bought far grander houses. One of them was
Armstrong House, a monumental Italian Renaissance palazzo
directly across Bull Street from the staid Oglethorpe
Club. Armstrong House dwarfed the Oglethorpe Club, and,
according to local lore, that was very much its purpose.
George Armstrong, a shipping magnate, was said to have
built the house in 1919 in response to being blackballed by
the club. Although that story was not, in fact, true, Armstrong
House was a lion of a house. It gloated and glowered
and loomed. It even had a curving colonnade that reached
out like a giant paw as if to swat the Oglethorpe Club off its
high horse across the street.
<P>
   The outrageous magnificence of Armstrong House appealed
to Williams and to his growing appetite for grandeur.
He was not a member of the Oglethorpe Club. Bachelors
from middle Georgia who sold antiques were not likely to be
asked to join - not that it bothered him. He installed his antiques
shop in Armstrong House for a year and then sold the
house to the law firm of Bouhan, Williams and Levy and
went on about the business of living like, if not being, an
aristocrat. He made more frequent buying trips to Europe - in
style now, on the QE2 - and sent back whole container
loads of important paintings and fine English furniture. He
bought his first pieces of Faberge. Williams was gaining stature
in Savannah, to the irritation of certain blue bloods.
"How does it feel to be nouveau riche?" he was asked on one
occasion. "It's the riche that counts," Williams answered.
Having said that, he bought Mercer House.
<P>
   Mercer House had been empty for more than ten years. It
stood at the west end of Monterey Square, the most elegant
of Savannah's many tree-shaded squares. It was an Italianate
mansion of red brick with tall, arched windows set off by
ornate ironwork balconies. It sat back from the street, aloof
behind its apron of lawn and its cast-iron fence, not so much
looking out on the square as presiding over it. The most recent
occupants of the house, the Shriners, had used it as the
Alee Temple. They had hung a neon-lit scimitar over the
front door and driven around inside on motorcycles. Williams
set about restoring the house to something greater
than its original elegance. When work was completed in
1970, he gave a black-tie Christmas party and invited the
cream of Savannah society. On the night of his party, every
window of Mercer House was ablaze with candlelight; every
room had sparkling chandeliers. Clusters of onlookers stood
outside watching the smart arrivals and staring in amazement
at the beautiful house that had been dark for so long.
A pianist played cocktail music on the grand piano downstairs;
an organist played classical pieces in the ballroom
above. Butlers in white jackets circulated with silver trays.
Ladies in long gowns moved up and down the spiral stairs in
rivers of satin and silk chiffon. Old Savannah was dazzled.
<P>
   The party soon became a permanent fixture on Savannah's
social calendar. Williams always scheduled it to occur at the
climax of the winter season - the night before the Cotillion's
debutante ball. That Friday night became known as the
night of Jim Williams' Christmas party. It was the Party of
the Year, and this was no small accomplishment for Williams.
"You have to understand," a sixth-generation Savannahian declared, 
"Savannah takes its parties very seriously.
This is a town where gentlemen own their own white tie and
tails. We don't rent them. So it's quite a tribute to Jim that
he has been able to make so prominent a place for himself
on the social scene, in spite of not being a native Savannahian
and being a bachelor."
<P>
   The food at Williams' parties was always provided by
Savannah's most sought-after cateress, Lucille Wright. Mrs.
Wright was a light-skinned black woman whose services
were so well regarded that Savannah's leading hostesses had
been known to change the date of a party if she was not
available. Mrs. Wright's touch was easy to spot. Guests
would nibble on a cheese straw or eat a marinated shrimp or
take a bite of a tomato finger sandwich and smile knowingly.
"Lucille . . . !" they would say, and nothing more
needed to be said. (Lucille Wright's tomato sandwiches were
never soggy. She patted the tomato slices with paper towels
first. That was just one of her many secrets.) Her clients held
her in high esteem. "She's a real lady," they often said, and
you could tell from the way they said it that they considered
that high praise for a black woman. Mrs. Wright admired
her patrons in return, although she did confide that Savannah's
hostesses, even the rich ones, tended to come to her
and say, "Now, Lucille, I want a nice party, but I don't want
to spend too much money." Jim Williams was not like that.
"He likes things done in the grand style," Mrs. Wright said,
"and he's very liberal with his money. Very. Very. He always
tells me, 'Lucille, I'm having two hundred people and I want
low-country food and plenty of it. I don't want to run out.
Get what you need. I don't care what it costs.'"
<P>
   Jim Williams' Christmas party was, in the words of the
Georgia Gazette, the party that Savannah socialites "lived
for." Or lived without, for Williams enjoyed changing his
guest list from year to year. He wrote names on file cards
and arranged them in two stacks: an In stack and an Out
stack. He shunted the cards from one stack to the other and
made no secret of it. If a person had displeased him in any
way during the year, that person would do penance come
Christmas. "My Out stack," he once told the Gazette, "is an
inch thick."
<P>
An early-evening mist had turned the view of Monterey
Square into a soft-focus stage set with pink azaleas billowing
beneath a tattered valance of live oaks and Spanish moss.
The pale marble pedestal of the Pulaski monument glowed
hazily in the background. A copy of the book At Home in
Savannah - great Interiors lay on Williams' coffee table. I
had seen the same book on several other coffee tables in Savannah,
but here the effect was surreal: The cover photograph
was of this very room.
<P>
   For the better part of an hour, Williams had taken me on
a tour of Mercer House and his antiques shop, which was
quartered in the carriage house. In the ballroom, he played
the pipe organ, first a piece by Bach, then "I Got Rhythm."
Finally, to demonstrate the organ's deafening power, he
played a passage from Cesar Franck's "Piece Heroique."
"When my neighbors let their dogs howl all night," said Williams,
"this is what they get in return." In the dining room,
he showed me his royal treasures: Queen Alexandra's silverware,
the Duchess of Richmond's porcelain, and a silver service
for sixty that had belonged to a Russian grand duke.
The coat of arms from the door of Napoleon's coronation
carriage hung on the wall in the study. Here and there
around the house lay Faberge objects - cigarette cases, ornaments,
jewel boxes - the trappings of aristocracy, nobility,
royalty. As we moved from room to room, tiny red lights
flickered in electronic recognition of our presence.
<P>
   Williams was wearing gray slacks and a blue cotton shirt
turned up at the sleeves. His heavy black shoes and thick
rubber soles were oddly out of place in the elegance of Mercer
House, but practical; Williams spent several hours a day
on his feet restoring antique furniture in his basement workshop.
His hands were raw and callused, but they had been
scrubbed clean of stains and grease.
<P>
   "If there's a single trait common to all Savannahians," he
was saying, "it's their love of money and their unwillingness
to spend it."
<P>
   "Then who buys those high-priced antiques I just saw in
your shop?" I asked.
<P>
   "That's exactly my point," he said. "People from out
town. Atlanta, New Orleans, New York. That's where I
most of my business. When I find an especially fine piece
furniture I send a photograph of it to a New York dealer.
don't waste time trying to sell it here in Savannah. It's not
that people in Savannah aren't rich enough. It's just that
they're very cheap. I'll give you an example.
<P>
   "There's a woman here, a grande dame at the very apex of
society and one of the richest people in the Southeast, let
alone Savannah. She owns a copper mine. She built a big
house in an exclusive part of town, a replica of a famous
Louisiana plantation house with huge white columns and
curved stairs. You can see it from the water. Everybody goes,
'Oooo, look!' when they pass by it. I adore her. She's been
like a mother to me. But she's the cheapest woman who ever
lived! Some years ago she ordered a pair of iron gates for her
house. They were designed and built especially for her. But
when they were delivered she pitched a fit, said they were
horrible, said they were filth. 'Take them away,' she said, 'I
never want to see them again!' Then she tore up the bill,
which was for $1,400 - a fair amount of money in those
days.
<P>
   "The foundry took the gates back, but they didn't know
what to do with them. After all, there wasn't much demand
for a pair of ornamental gates exactly that size. The only
thing they could do was to sell the iron for its scrap value.
So they cut the price from $1,400 to $190. Naturally, the
following day the woman sent a man over to the foundry
with $190, and today those gates are hanging on her gateposts
where they were originally designed to go. That's pure
Savannah. And that's what I mean by cheap. You mustn't be
taken in by the moonlight and magnolias. There's more to
Savannah than that. Things can get very murky." Williams
stroked his cat and tapped another ash into the ashtray.
<P>
   "We had a judge back in the nineteen-thirties, a member
of one of the city's leading families. He lived one square over
from here in a big house with tall white columns. His older
son was going around town with a gangster's girlfriend. The
gangster warned him to stop, but the judge's son kept right
at it. One night the doorbell rang and when the judge
opened the door, he found his son lying on the porch bleeding
to death with his private parts tucked under his lapel.
The doctors sewed his genitals back on, but the body rejected
them and he died. The next day, the headline in the
paper read FALL FROM PORCH PROVES FATAL. Most members of
that family still deny the murder ever happened, but the victim's
sister tells me it's true.
<P>
   "It doesn't end there. The same judge had another son.
This one lived in a house on Whitaker Street. He and his
wife used to fight. I mean really go at it, throw each other
across rooms and that sort of thing. During one of those
fights, their three-year-old daughter came downstairs unnoticed,
just when the husband was getting ready to fling his
wife into a marble-topped table. When the woman hit the
table, it overturned and crushed the little girl. They didn't
find out about it until an hour later when they were picking
up the debris from the fight. As far as the family is concerned,
that incident never happened either."
<P>
   Williams picked up the decanter of Madeira And refilled
our glasses. "Drinking Madeira is a great Savannah ritual,
you know," he said. "It's a celebration of failure, actually.
The British sent whole shiploads of grapevines over from
Madeira in the eighteenth century in hopes of turning Georgia
into a wine-producing colony. Savannah's on the same
latitude as Madeira. Well, the vines died, but Savannah
never lost its taste for Madeira. Or any other kind of liquor
for that matter. Prohibition didn't even slow things down
here. Everybody had a way of getting liquor, even little old
ladies. Especially the old ladies. A bunch of them bought a
Cuban rumrunner and ran it back and forth between here
and Cuba."
<P>
   Williams sipped his Madeira. "One of those ladies died
just a few months ago. Old Mrs. Morton. She was a marvel.
She did exactly as she pleased all her life, God bless her. Her
son came home for Christmas vacation one year and brought
his college roommate with him. Mama and the college
roommate fell in love; the roommate moved into the master
bedroom with her; Daddy moved into the guest bedroom,
and the son went back to college and never came home
again. From then on, Mr. and Mrs. Morton and the roommate
lived in that house under those circumstances until the
old man died. They kept up appearances and pretended
nothing at all outrageous had happened. Mama's young
lover served as her chauffeur. Whenever he dropped her off
and picked her up at her bridge parties, the other ladies
would peer out at them through the venetian blinds. But
they never let on that they were interested, because nobody,
nobody ever mentioned his name in her presence."
<P>
   Williams fell silent for a moment, no doubt reflecting
upon the recently departed Mrs. Morton. Through the open
window, Monterey Square was quiet except for the rasp of a
cricket and the passing, now and then, of a car unhurriedly
negotiating the turns around the square.
<P>
   "What do you suppose would happen," I asked, "if the
tour guides told that sort of story to their busloads of
tourists?"
<P>
   "Not possible," said Williams. "They keep it very prim
and proper."
<P>
   I told Williams that as I was coming up the walk earlier I
had heard the guide on one of the tour buses talking about
this house.
<P>
   "Bless their boring little hearts," said Williams. "What did
the guide say?"
<P>
   "She said that the house was the birthplace of the famous
songwriter Johnny Mercer, the man who wrote 'Moon
River,' 'I Wanna Be Around,' 'Too Marvelous for Words,' and
other standards."
<P>
  "Wrong, but not completely off base," said Williams.
"What else?"
<P>
   "That last year Jacqueline Onassis offered to buy the
house and everything in it for two million dollars."
<P>
   "The guide gets C minus for accuracy," said Williams
"And now, I'll tell you what really happened:
<P>
   "Construction of the house was begun in 1860 by the
Confederate general Hugh Mercer, Johnny Mercer's great-grandfather.
It was unfinished when the Civil War broke out
and after the war, General Mercer was imprisoned and tried
for the murder of two army deserters. He was eventually acquitted,
largely on the testimony of his son, and released
from a jail a broken and very angry man. He sold the house,
and the new owners completed it. So none of the Mercers
ever lived here, including Johnny. Late in his life, though,
Johnny used to drop in when he was in town. In fact, he
taped a Mike Douglas show in the front yard. He once offered
to buy the house, but I told him, 'Johnny, you don't
need it, you'll end up playing houseboy to it just as I have.'
And that's as close as he came to ever living here."
<P>
   Williams leaned back and sent a thin stream of cigar
smoke ceilingward. "I'll come to Jacqueline Onassis in a moment,"
he said, "but first I want to let you in on another
piece of history that the tour guides never mention. It's an
incident I call 'Flag Day.' It happened a couple of years ago."
He stood up and went over to the window. "Monterey
Square is lovely," he said. "In my opinion, it's the most beautiful
of all the squares in Savannah. The architecture, the
trees, the monument, the way it all fits together. Moviemakers
love it. Something like twenty feature films have been
shot in Savannah in the past six years, and Monterey Square
is one of their favorite shooting locations.
<P>
   "Every time filming begins the town goes wild. Everybody
wants to be an extra and meet the stars and watch from the
sidelines. The mayor and the city councilmen think it's wonderful
because the film companies will spend money here,
and Savannah will become famous, and that will help
tourism.
