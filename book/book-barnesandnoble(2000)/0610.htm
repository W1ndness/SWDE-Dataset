Now the much-hyped television show Morgue has begun shooting in Manhattan, and just as Bailey starts reminiscing about her fling with the show&rsquo;s gorgeous star, Chris Wickersham, he phones her. But Chris isn&rsquo;t calling to rekindle their flame. His friend Tom, who plays a small role on the show, has gone missing, and while nobody seems to be alarmed, Chris can&rsquo;t believe his friend would just take off before the show premieres.<P>Bailey starts to investigate Tom&rsquo;s disappearance as a favor to Chris, and she soon realizes there is more going on than meets the eye. Delving deeper into the glamorous yet crazy world of TV, she finds herself in the middle of a killer story &ndash; literally - and also in the line of fire. As the missing person case gets hotter, so does the action between the sheets for Bailey - especially the moment her crush Beau Regan hits town again.<P>When mysterious phone calls turn ominous and it&rsquo;s clear she&rsquo;s being stalked, Bailey becomes determined to solve the case in less time than the length of a Hollywood marriage. Unless she unearths the truth, she could become the inspiration for Morgue&rsquo;s next episode.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>In this stylish, funny fifth caper (after 2005's <I>Over Her Dead Body</I>) from <I>Cosmopolitan</I>magazine editor-in-chief White, <I>Buzz</I>gossip mag reporter Bailey Weggins takes a moment off from tracking celebrity crime to hunt down a missing actor. Her one-time hunky fling, Chris Wickersham, calls on her for help finding his friend Tom Fain, who appears with Chris on the TV show <I>Morgue</I>, a <I>C.S.I.</I>-type drama shooting in New York City. Bailey and Chris learn that Tom had been having an affair with the producer's girlfriend and that he withdrew $7,000 in cash before he disappeared. Bailey's dogged pursuit of Tom's trail leads to his family home in upstate New York, where she discovers his rotting remains. Even when another member of the <I>Morgue</I>cast is murdered and Bailey also becomes a target of a very theatrical killer, her lively love life continues with a renewed flirtation with Chris and lingering attraction to another fling, documentary filmmaker Beau Regan. White's flair for pop culture and affection for single career women make this trendy romantic suspense cocktail an addictive read. <I>(May 23)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information

											I have read all the books in this series, but this one was slightly disappointing.  I enjoyed the mystery but was left with a bit of &quot;killer out of left field&quot; feeling. Frankly, I thought some of the more personal scenes were somewhat overdone; seemed more blatant that in previous books and without necessity. Overall, I like Bailey Weggins as a character and plan to continue to read Kate White's books.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/49740000/49741295.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Kate White</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>New York, New York</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.KateWhite.com">* Kate White's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>As the editor-in-chief of famed magazine <I>Cosmopolitan</I>, Kate White knows women inside and out. She knows what women like, and she especially knows what they like to read. So it's no surprise that her deliciously decadent mystery novels are such a hit with the ladies. <p>    White came from a strong background in the magazine world. Since getting her foot in the door at <I>Glamour</I> magazine by winning their Top Ten College Women contest, she has worked as an editorial assistant at <I>Glamour</I>, later becoming a feature writer and columnist for the magazine. Following her stint at <I>Glamour</I>, she worked her way up to editor-in-chief for <I>Child</I>, then <I>Working Woman</I>, <I>McCall's</I>, and <I>Redbook</I>. In 1998, White became editor-in-chief of <I>Cosmopolitan</I>. <p>  Since joining the ranks of <I>Cosmo</I>, White has spear-headed a spin-off magazine called <I>Cosmo Style</I>, started a channel called Cosmo Radio on Sirius Radio, and published books such as <I>Cosmo Kama Sutra</I> through the magazine's Cosmo Books. She is also responsible for driving <I>Cosmopolitan's</I> readership through the roof. Since taking control of the magazine, she has increased its circulation by over 500,000. So, how can a woman with such a full plate find time to also launch a successful fiction-writing career? Well, as she says on her web site, "I don't really have any other hobbies other than cooking. I can't sing, play a musical instrument, excel at sports, draw, quilt, knit or decoupage. So writing mysteries is my hobby." <p>  That hobby has led White to create sultry true-crime reporter Bailey Weggins, who has sashayed her way through three novels since <I>If Looks Could Kill</I> was published in 2002. The following year, Weggins reappeared in White's second perfect-for-the-beach mystery. <I>A Body to Die For</I> is rife with White's trademark wit and sexiness and became another big seller. The book not only pleased White's readers but also garnered her some well-deserved praise from the press. <I>Publishers Weekly</I>, which was critical of <I>If Looks Could Kill</I>, applauded <I>A Body to Die For</I>, saying that "fans will find Bailey's sassy wit as engaging as ever and are sure to admire the skill with which White pulls together all the threads." <p>  In 2005, White published her third Bailey Weggins novel, <I>Over Her Dead Body</I>. This time out, Bailey loses her job at <I>Gloss</I> magazine (no doubt a fictional stand-in for <I>Cosmo</I>). However, things get hotter than ever when she begins covering celebrity crime for <I>Buzz</I> magazine and her new boss is murdered. Again, White is pleasing fans and critics alike. <p>  White's most recent release is a brief break from Weggins's exploits, but it certainly isn't a break from the kind of sly blend of humor and sex that readers have come to expect from her. <I>How to Set His Thighs on Fire: 86 Red-Hot Lessons on Love, Life, Men, and (Especially) Sex</I> is a slightly satirical, high-spirited take on the kinds of self-help guides found in women's mags such as, well, <I>Cosmopolitan</I>. But fans of Bailey Weggins should not fear -- White is currently working on the next installment of her hit series.<p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>White is not the only lady in her family with a knack</b> for mystery writing.

It was the first Nancy Drew I read, and not only made me see that I could be addicted to reading, but also that I <I>loved</I> mysteries.<p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li><I>All the King's Men</I> by Robert Penn Warren -- Brilliant, beautiful and a fabulous glimpse into a part of U.S. history. <p>  <li><I>MacBeth</I> by William Shakespeare -- I know it's a play, but I love it. I love to just read it. <p>  <li><I>The Year of Living Dangerously</I> by Christopher J. Koch -- A fabulous coming-of-age novel about a foreign correspondent in Jakarta in the �60s. <p>  <li><I>A Thousand Acres</I> by Jane Smiley -- It was so compelling, I couldn't read another book for weeks. <p>  <li><I>Tender Is The Night</I> by F. Scott Fitgerald -- I still remember how moved I was the first time I read it. <p>  <li><I>The Sun Also Rises</I> by Ernest Hemingway -- I just reread it, and it holds up even now. <p>  <li><I>Atigone</I> -- Another play, but I mean the one by Anouilh, not Sophocles. It always makes me cry when I read it. <p>  <li><I>The Dubliners</I> by James Joyce -- I reread "The Dead" over and over. <p>  <li>All the novels by John Fowles, especially <I>The Magus</I>, which you should read at 19, all full of longing. <p>  <li>A tie between <I>The White Hotel</I> by D. M. Thomas, a haunting mystery of sorts, and Camille Paglia's book on the best poems ever written -- It gave me a whole new appreciation of poetry. God, there are so many others. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>The Year of Living Dangerously</I> -- Great drama, with a historical backdrop.<p>  <li><I>Anne of the Thousand Days</I><p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I do like rock and country western, but I prefer classical -- especially opera. I listen to that when I write. I just fell in love with Carmina Burana, and play it constantly when I write. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  <I>All the King's Men</I> -- I'd love to discuss it before the new movie comes out. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I love to give the book <I>Jacqueline Kennedy's Favorite Poems</I> to new mothers; I love to get bird books from my kids. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I love to write early, in a small office, with a breeze blowing and a hot cup of tea. <p>    <b>What are you working on now?</b><br>  The next Bailey Weggins mystery, <I>Drop Dead Gorgeous</I>. <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I was lucky. My <I>Cosmo</I> job gave me entr�e. <p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be?</b><br>  My mom: Anne White.<p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Don't set up unnecessary hurdles for yourself. If no one is responding to your letters, maybe you need to re-craft it. If no one is liking your book, maybe it needs a whole new beginning. Since I work with a lot of writers, I see that they are often very resistant to "hearing" criticism. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Celebrity snoop Bailey Weggins is back.

Not one of those totally creepy   coincidences that make you feel as if someone has just walked across   your grave. In fact, later I could see that the phone call I got   that late summer night wasn't all that unexpected-but at the time it   made me catch my breath. And, of course, it was the start of   everything horrible that happened....  <p>  I'd decided to stop by the office that day, something I rarely do on   Tuesdays. It was crazy hot for the middle of September, and it would   have been nice to just hang on the brick terrace of my apartment in   Greenwich Village, chugging a few iced teas. But a new deputy editor   had started recently-Valerie Crowe, a hyper, edgy chick who left you   overwhelmed with an urge to shoot a tranquilizer dart into her   ass-and I thought it would be smart to give her some face time. My   copy goes through the executive editor, but it's one of the deputy   editors who assigns me most of my stories and often suggests leads   for me to follow up on. Since Tuesday is the day after closing, I   knew she'd probably have a few minutes to spare. Most of the staff   never even gets in before noon that day.  <p>  My name is Bailey Weggins, and I'm a reporter for <i>Buzz</i>, one of the   weekly celebrity gossip magazines that have become like crack   cocaine for women under thirty-five these days. Unlike most of the   staff, Idon't cover the botched marriages and bulimic ordeals of   the stars. Instead, I report on celebrity crime-like when an   A-lister hurls a phone at a hotel desk clerk or hires a hit man to   shoot his wife.  <p>  It's not something I'd ever imagined myself doing. I was a straight   crime writer for the ten years after college graduation, but when   the job opened up early in the summer, curiosity and the need for a   regular gig prodded me to take it.  <p>  "Celebrity crime reporter-are you saying it's some sort of   specialized area of journalism?" my mother had asked at the time, as   if it were on a par with becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon or   astrophysicist.  <p>  Initially, I was at a disadvantage because I didn't know-excuse the   expression-jackshit about celebrities. Oh, I'd picked up tidbits   about the really major stars-you know, like Brad and Angelina and   Gwyneth and TomKat-from listening to friends dish as well as   perusing gossip magazines during pedicures. But I was clueless about   most of the other stars in the celebrity universe. In fact, until   two weeks into my job at <i>Buzz</i>, I'd thought Jake Gyllenhaal and   Orlando Bloom were the <i>same person</i>. But I caught on pretty quickly,   and to my surprise, I grew to really enjoy my   two-to-three-day-a-week arrangement. Celebrities not only live   large, they misbehave large, too. Covering their crimes, I   discovered, could be awfully entertaining.  <p>  One more plus. In November, a small publishing house was releasing a   collection of my crime pieces, <i>Bad Men and Wicked Women</i>, and the job   would be leverage for PR.  <p>  The <i>Buzz</i> offices were practically tomblike when I stepped off the   elevator, though it was mercifully cool, as if the low body count   had prevented the air from rising above 65 degrees that day. I   nodded to a few people as I walked through the huge cube   farm/bullpen that constitutes a major chunk of our offices. I'm in a   part of that area nicknamed the Pod, which abuts the art and   production departments and houses many of the writers and junior   editors. The senior editors are in glass-fronted offices that rim   the area. My workstation is right next to that of a senior writer   named Jessie Pendergrass and behind Leo Zern, a photo editor they   couldn't find room for in the photo department.  <p>  "Hey," I said to Leo as I tossed my purse and tote bag onto my desk.   He was the only one in the general vicinity. He tore his eyes off   his computer screen and swiveled just his head in my direction.  <p>  "To what do we owe this honor?" he asked. "I thought you weren't   coming in today."  <p>  "I had a few things I wanted to take care of. Jessie around?"  <p>  "She's not in yet. I heard her tell someone on the phone yesterday   that her bikini line was a disaster, so maybe she's having it   administered to."  <p>  "Anything going on here?"  <p>  "Not really. Oh, there was a little bit of a dustup this morning.   You know how we said Britney Spears looked like a Smurf?"  <p>  "No. Okay, I'll take your word for it."  <p>  "Nash got a phone call today, and the fur was flying." He was   talking about Nash Nolan, the editor in chief.  <p>  "From Britney's publicist?"  <p>  "No, it was from a <i>Smurf</i> representative. They don't want to be   compared to her."  <p>  "Very funny. So what are you working on?" I sidled over to his desk   and checked out the computer screen. There was a grainy shot of a   blond starlet type I didn't recognize sitting at an outdoor   restaurant, jamming half a dozen French fries into her mouth as if   she were stuffing dirty clothes into an overfilled hamper. "God, the   paparazzi don't let these chicks alone, do they," I said.  <p>  "The ones who take these shots don't consider themselves paparazzi,"   he said. "They're <i>snackarazzi</i>."  <p>  "You're kidding, right?"  <p>  "Not at all. These are the real money shots these days. They're   almost as good as one of a star scratching her ass."  <p>  "Remind me not to order a double bacon cheeseburger the next time   I'm at a sidewalk caf&eacute;."  <p>  "I think <i>you're</i> safe, Bailey," he said, smirking.  <p>  I checked my e-mail and then a bunch of Web sites to see if any   A-listers had landed themselves in hot water that day, but things   seemed fairly quiet. After grabbing a cup of coffee, I wandered down   to the office of the new deputy editor.  <p>  "Hi, Val," I said, poking my head in the door and forcing a smile.   I've always wished I were good at office politics, but fawning and   bullshitting just don't come easily to me, particularly if the   person at the other end is a real jerk, which I suspected Valerie   was. A guy I used to work with at the <i>Albany Times Union</i>, when I was   a newspaper reporter right out of college, said that I butt-kissed   about as well as a blowtorch.  <p>  "What can I do for you?" Valerie asked without enthusiasm. Her dark   hair was slicked off her face today, accentuating the large sharp   nose she sported between brown eyes. She reminded me of how our   family dog used to look when he emerged sopping wet from a pond.  <p> "Just thought I'd check in-see if you needed me for anything," I   told her.  <p>  "What are you working on now?" she asked, a thin layer of impatience   coating her question.  <p>  Gosh, I thought, you just don't like me, do you? But I couldn't tell   why. She'd arrived at the magazine not long after the previous   editor in chief, Mona Hodges, had been killed in her office by   several blows to the head. It had been a tumultuous time,   particularly for me, for not only had I found Mona that night, but I   also had later figured out who had murdered her, nearly getting   killed myself in the process. Nash, the number two at the time, had   been named editor in chief shortly afterward; a deputy editor had   taken over for Nash, and now Valerie had the deputy job. I sometimes   wondered if she resented the fact that Nash and I were tight and   that I had plenty of autonomy.  <p>  "Nothing major at the moment," I told her. "Just following a few   leads. I probably won't come in again this week unless something   breaks."  <p>  "Just let Aubrey know," she said, referring to the managing editor.   Then she glanced over at her computer screen as if she were dying to   get back to work.  <p>  "Sure," I said, and walked off. How nice that I'd bothered to take   the subway up from the Village.  <p>  As long as I was at the office, I followed up with staffers on a few   matters and polished off another cup of coffee. And then, with   nothing more to do, I stood up to go.  <p>  "Oh, Bailey, I know what your favorite TV show is going to be this   season," Leo said as I was shutting off my computer. "Have you seen   the fall lineup?"  <p>  "No, but let me guess. <i>Survivor-The New York Singles Scene</i>?" <p>  "Nope. A new show called <i>Morgue</i>. It's about investigators from the   medical examiner's office. Sounds perfect for someone with your   grisly interests."  <p>  "Aren't there a million shows like that already?" I asked.  <p>  "I guess the public can't get enough of them."  <p>  Just to humor Leo, I sauntered over to his desk and glanced down at   his computer screen. Along with the description of the show, there   were a few shots from episodes and a group photo of the ensemble   cast, all perfectly coiffed and smileless, their eyes burning with   desire to see justice done and have the show win its time slot in   the ratings. Suddenly I felt my jaw drop. One of the actors I was   staring at in the ensemble cast was Chris Wickersham. He was a model   and actor I'd had a short fling with last winter.  <p>  "Oh, wow," I said.  <p>  "What-you think you're really gonna like it?"  <p>  "No, the guy on the far left. I know him."  <p>  "Really?" he said as he glanced back at the screen. "You mean-Chris   Wickersham, who plays Jared Hanson, the sometimes moody but   brilliantly intuitive investigator? Is he straight?"  <p>  "Very. It says it's about the New York City Morgue. Does that mean   it's shooting here?"  <p>  "Not necessarily. Lemme see ... Yes, shot entirely in New York   City. Was this guy your boyfriend?"  <p>  "Sort of. For about four seconds. Is there anything else?"  <p>  "No, just that it premieres in two weeks."  <p>  "Look, I'd better fly. Tell Jessie hi for me, will you?"  <p>  I grabbed my purse and tote bag and headed out of the building. My   mind was racing, thinking of what I'd just learned about Chris. The   last time I had laid eyes on him was right before he'd struck out   for L.A. last March, hoping like millions of other guys with dreamy   eyes and perfect jawlines to be cast in a pilot for the fall. We   hadn't promised each other anything about staying in touch (though   early on he'd sent two e-mails and one goofy postcard of the   Hollywood sign), and I'd just assumed he hadn't met with any real   success yet. But he had. And based on the public love of carnage and   corpses, there was every chance the show would be a success. I felt   happy for Chris; he deserved fame and fortune. But at the same time,   there was something vaguely disconcerting about the whole thing that   I couldn't put my finger on. Maybe it was knowing that a guy I'd   locked lips with was now poised to become the kind of hottie women   across America drooled over and dished about the next day at the   watercooler.  <p>  I took the subway to 8th and Broadway, hit the gym for thirty   minutes, grabbed a few supplies at the deli, and then headed to my   apartment at 9th and Broadway. Though I'd left home only a few hours   earlier, my place was stifling hot. I turned on the AC, fixed an ice   water, and flopped on the couch. As I took the first sip of my   drink, I let memories of Chris Wickersham run roughshod around my   brain. I had met him a year ago April, at a wedding, where he had   worked as one of the bartenders, supplementing the money he made   from modeling and small acting gigs. He was absolutely gorgeous, the   kind of guy it almost hurt to look at.  <p>  Though he took my number and called me, I'd blown him off. He was   ten years younger than me, and though that kind of age gap hadn't   bothered Cameron Diaz or Demi Moore, I just couldn't imagine having   a boyfriend I was old enough to have baby-sat for. Then, nine months   later, we'd reconnected when I'd needed his help during a murder   investigation. I was dating a guy named Jack steadily by then, and I   tried not to send any of the wrong messages to Chris, but one night   he had kissed me and I'd felt it all the way to my tippy toes. It   was the beginning of my doubts about my relationship with Jack. Soon   afterward I was single again. Chris and I had a few dates and some   serious make-out sessions, but I'd been unable to take the   relationship-sexually and otherwise-beyond that. One of the last   things Chris had said to me was, "Jeez, Bailey, what is it with   you-yes or no?" In the end, it had been no. In hindsight, I thought   my doubts might have been due to guilt. I always associated Chris   with my breakup.  <p>  If I met him today, would I still feel those doubts? I wondered.   What would it be like to date a guy millions of people watched on   TV? Christ, Bailey, I thought, you're starting to sound like a star   fucker.  <p>  I drained the last of my water. I'd planned to stay in tonight to   work on a freelance article. Plus, ever since I'd had my heart   bruised during the summer by a guy named Beau Regan, I'd been lying   low. But thanks to the heat wave, the idea now held nada appeal. I   wondered who I might be able to drum up for companionship on short   notice. My seventy-year-old next-door neighbor, Landon, who I   sometimes palled around with, had said he was heading over to the   Film Forum on West Houston Street to see a German flick. A college   pal of mine from Brown had recently split with her husband, and she   was game for anything that provided escape from her apartment, but an evening in her company could be exhausting. She tended to ask an   endless series of borderline-hostile questions that were impossible   for me to answer-like "Are all men dickheads or just the ones I   meet?" "Who would <i>drink</i> a prickly pear martini, do you know?" and   "Do <i>you</i> think I'm brimming with anger?"  <p>  Maybe I would just head out alone and eat a quiet dinner outdoors at   one of the restaurants over on MacDougal. As I padded toward my   bedroom to change, my cell phone buzzed from my purse, making me   jump.  <p>  "Hello," I said after digging it out.  <p>  "Bailey?"  <p>  "Yes."  <p>  "Hi, it's Chris Wickersham."  <p>  For a moment, I thought it was Leo playing a practical joke. But he   wouldn't have been familiar with that deep, smooth voice-so I knew   for certain it had to be Chris. I caught my breath, stunned by the   eeriness of the timing.  <p>  "Oh, my gosh," I said. "I-I was just reading about you two hours   ago. Congratulations-I, er, heard about the show." God, Bailey, this   is why you <i>write</i> professionally, I thought. You shouldn't be allowed   to open your mouth.  <p>  "Thanks," he said. "The opportunity kind of came out of nowhere.   I've been planning to call you-I mean, just to say hello."  <p>  "So you're back in New York?"  <p>  "Yeah-I've got a studio in TriBeCa. I don't want to overextend   myself until I know if the show is going to take off or not."  <p>  "Is the shooting schedule as brutal as you hear?"  <p>  "Fourteen-hour days, sometimes. But this is what I wanted, and I've   got no complaints. The show kicks off in a couple of weeks, and then   we play the ratings game."  <p>  "It sounds like a super idea for a show-I'm sure it will be a hit."  "Kind of your type of show, huh?"  <p>  "You're the second person who said that today."  <p>  "Well, look, the reason I called ... I mean, I wanted to say hi,   but-is there any chance you could meet me for a drink? There's   something I need to talk to you about."  <p>  "Sure," I said. His tone didn't suggest a man who'd been pining for   me for months and had decided to make one last stab at winning my   heart, but I was still curious. "When were you thinking?"  <p>  "I know this is short notice, but I was wondering if you could do it   now. It's really pretty urgent. You're the one person I can turn to   on this."  <p>  "What is it? Are you in some kind of trouble?"  <p>  "No, no. But a friend of mine may be. I need your advice."  <p>  "Can you give me a hint?" I asked, though I figured that if a guy he   knew was in trouble, it had to involve drugs or money or both.  <p>  "It-Look, would you mind talking about it in person? I hate the   idea of starting to get into it on the phone and then having to   cover the same ground again when we meet."  <p>  "Well, I <i>could</i> do it now, actually," I admitted. "I was planning to   stay in and work tonight, but it can wait."  <p>  "That's terrific," he said. He suggested we meet in an hour and   asked me to recommend a place near me. I threw out the name of a bar   on Second Avenue between 9th and 10th. It would take me less than   five minutes to walk there.  <p>  After signing off, I walked distractedly into the bathroom and   splashed cool water on my face and in my armpits. I couldn't believe   what had just happened. Maybe it was my destiny that Chris   Wickersham would pop into my life every nine months or so. I   wondered if there was any chance that he was using a so-called   problem with a friend as an excuse to make contact with me. It had   been hard to tell on the phone. And I wasn't at all sure how I'd   feel when I saw him. I had never once stopped finding him   staggeringly attractive. Perhaps now that I was no longer guilt   stricken-and my love life was currently in the Dumpster with a   capital D-I would feel the urge to go for it this time.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'> Excerpted from <b>Lethally Blond</b> by <b>Kate White </b>  Copyright &copy 2007   by Kate White.
