											Loved this book from beginning to end.  Before I'd read the book, I'd seen the movie a hundred times and loved it also.  I always figured I'd read the book one day and I did.  Louis was made a vampire by Lestat and regrets that decision for the rest of his life.  When Louis finally decides that he'll leave Lestat, Lestat makes a child that Louis almost killed a vampire to keep him with him.  Claudia and Louis eventually leave Lestat to look for other vampires.  But once they find them, they find out that they were not what they were looking for.  Louis tells all of this to a guy who records his story.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>ok<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=silky">silky</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-2"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1344114_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780345337665_BK_1_1344114" href="#previewReview_1344114" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>March 27, 2010:

Rice recast the undead as a secret society of decadent aesthetes, alternately entranced by the world's beauty and haunted by spiritual despair. Set largely in the author's home city of New Orleans, the book created a fantasy underworld rich and compelling enough to sustain its writer and readers through nine sequels, known collectively as The Vampire Chronicles.  <p>  Rice wrote <I>Interview with the Vampire</I>, she said later, "without ever realizing I was writing about loss. I was writing about my daughter's loss [Rice's daughter died in 1972]. And I was writing about my loss of Catholic faith long before that, because I had lost my faith in the year 1960, when I first went to college."  <p>  After her first book, Rice continued to write about loss -- and about vampires, witches and demons -- for more than 25 years. She also wrote, under the pen name A.N. Roquelaure, the Beauty series, an erotic retelling of the story of Sleeping Beauty; writing as Anne Rampling, she published two other novels, <I>Exit to Eden</I> and <I>Belinda</I>.  <p>  But it is as the queen of gothic fiction that Anne Rice's fans know her best. Her fans are passionate about her, and she returns the sentiment, e-mailing tirelessly with them and occasionally posting on their blogs. She also adores communing with them in person on book tours: "They give me personal, priceless and unforgettable feedback and verification of what I have achieved for them in my books," she once explained in a <I>Salon</I> interview.  <p>  After <I>Blood Canticle</I> was released in 1993, her readers, accustomed to an output of one book a year, kept asking her what was coming next. "And I've told them, 'You may not want what I'm doing next'," she said in a <I>Newsweek</I> interview.  <p>  They were in for a surprise. In 1998, Rice had returned to the Roman Catholic Church, and in 2005 she published <I>Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt</I>, a novel about the childhood of Jesus, narrated by himself.   <p>  "It's the most startling public turnaround since Bob Dylan's <I>Slow Train Coming</I> announced that he'd been born again," wrote David Gates in <I>Newsweek</I>.  <p>  But as Rice sees it, <I>Christ the Lord</I> represents the fulfillment of a longing that has been in her books, and in her soul, all along.  <p>  "This subject is in no way a departure from that of my previous works; no one who knows my work could possibly think so," she said in a Q&A on her publisher's Web site. "The whole theme of <I>Interview with the Vampire</I> was Louis's quest for meaning in a godless world. He searched to find the oldest existing �immortal' simply to ask �What is the meaning of what we are?' I was always compelled to seek the �big answers.'"  <p>  <I>Christ the Lord</I> received mixed reviews, but many critics were as impressed with the book's style as its ambitious subject matter. "Rice's book is a triumph of tone -- her prose lean, lyrical, vivid -- and character," noted <I>Kirkus Reviews</I>. Janet Maslin wrote in <I>The New York Times Book Review</I>: "Even in biblical times and in the Holy Land, Rice retains her obsessions with ritual and purification, with lavish detail and gaudy decor. But she writes this book in a simpler, leaner style, giving it the slow but inexorable rhythm of an incantation. The restraint and prayerful beauty of <I>Christ the Lord</I> is apt to surprise her usual readers and attract new ones."  <p>  Some of those usual readers, of course, are now wondering whether she will write any more vampire novels. Will the vampire Lestat ever return?  <p>  Anne's response, from her publisher's Web site: "I can't see myself doing that. My vampires were metaphors for the outsiders, the lost, the wanderers in the darkness who remembered the warmth of God's light but couldn't find it. My wish to explore that is gone now. I want to meet a much bigger challenge."<p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>In our exlusive interview, Rice shared some fascinating stories with us: </I> <p>    <b>"My first job was as a cafeteria waitress</b> at a Walgreen's cafeteria over the drugstore on Canal and Baronne Street in New Orleans when I was sixteen years old. What a plunge into reality. Canal Street was then the only downtown in town. And I was in fact a boarding school student and unbeknownst to the principal, Sr. Felix, took this job on weekends. When she found out, she did not approve of a St. Joseph's Academy girl being a waitress. I was undeterred. I had discovered that I could turn time into money. I never forgot that lesson. The crashing boredom of childhood was over!" <p>    <b>"I was employed from then on a shocking variety of low level jobs</b>, including grill cook at a huge downtown cafeteria in San Francisco. I had to be there at 5:00 a.m., and once while I was en route on a bus, a drunken man fell asleep against me. The conductor had to wake him up for me to get off, poor guy. I think he'd staggered out of an after hours club. I was a crack waitress, a receptionist, a claims examiner, a theatre usherette in a big Cinerama house, and must have seen <I>It's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</I> over one hundred times while standing there with a flashlight. My last job in the straight world -- after motherhood -- was that of proofreader for a law book company. I hated it. Then my devoted husband Stan, who was already teaching and had been for some time, said, 'Stay home and write, I believe in you.' And I wrote <I>Interview with the Vampire</I>." <p>     <b>"I was a painfully slow reader.</b> Never really read a novel for pure pleasure until I was 35. It was <I>Ordinary People</I> by Judith Guest. Thought it very good." <p>    <b>"How do I unwind? There are different levels to unwind.</b> The primo way for me is to read history or some form of involving scholarship. A good book on an obscure subject. The recent bestseller <I>Krakatoa</I> by Simon Winchester was a wonderful example! That's a delicious unwind book. And there are others out there like that. The British writers seem especially good at it. But I can't get enough on how or why the Roman Empire fell. That's my idea of a good evening. To be in Florida with the deck door open to the roar of the waves, and a good book open to pages on the decline of paganism."  <p>    <b>"But! There is another kind of unwind.</b> The gripping fiction bestseller that takes two days. <I>The Da Vinci Code</I> is a good example. Every now and then I have time for that. I was smiling all the way through it. At one time in my life, I had read everything I could find on the Knights Templar (see First Way to Unwind, above), and on Opus Dei, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and so I was just tickled by what the author did with the material. And of course, I couldn't stop reading. Such cleverness, such a puzzle and right up to the last page." <p>    <b>"Interest and hobbies: well, my interests</b> are pretty much literary, except for maintaining two pre-Civil War houses in New Orleans (both family homes, one used for Mardi Gras season entertaining), and then I do devote some attention to my doll collection, which includes a small assortment of French antique dolls -- but this part of my life is drawing to a close. I am divesting myself of possessions rather than acquiring them. I am decorating, yes, and redecorating, but cutting down on the area, and the amount of things I have to maintain. I've let go of my huge property, St. Elizabeth's Orphanage -- a monster building which used to house my doll collection and so many other things. It was the fulfillment of dreams for about 10 years for me and so many other people. Weddings, book signings, book parties, benefits, fundraisers -- all kinds of events were held there. We even hosted President Clinton there. But that chapter of my life is over. For those ten years I asked 'what if?' many times. And I found out and as the result I am a satisfied person and a happy one. But it's over." <p>    <b>"I guess you could call my cats a hobby.</b> I have five of them, all Siberians and very lovable and demanding and sweet. They are keepers certainly. Other than that, I don't know that I have hobbies so much as passions, and my passions center around my writing." <p>    <b>"My only other diversion of late is seeing that <I>The Witching Hour</I></b> will soon be made into a television limited series -- that is, a mini-series that will extend over 10 hours. The scripts that have been written by writer-producer John Wilder are very simply wonderful -- profoundly faithful to the material and the characters. Our producer, Mark Wolper, is extraordinarily dedicated and we have the network behind us. It looks very good."<p>    <b>"Other news looming is that Elton John and Rob Roth are making a musical</b> based on the Vampire Chronicles for Broadway. I've talked to Elton John several times. He's absolutely charming. I've heard the first five songs, performed by him, and they were great. Bernie Taupin wrote the lyrics, and will write the lyrics for all. The other people involved have top credits. The treatment I read was a wonder -- very true to the books, quite terrific. My conversation with Rob Roth was very exciting." <p>    <b>"What I've learned from both these experiences so far --</b> the television series and the Broadway production -- is that the passion of people makes all the difference in the world. And sometimes it is the passion of a few key people that moves a project forward. Sometimes one person alone goes to the hard work of getting everybody else together, and making the studio that owns the underlying rights respond. People who love the work, who want to make something of it, can be brought together by that one key person. That one key person has to believe that past disappointments or failed connections don't mean anything. When you have that sort of person, something can happen."<p>    <b>"I've also learned that the author of the books</b> usually can't do it. Not unless she wants to stop being an author altogether and move to L.A. or N.Y. and become a producer."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2003, Anne Rice took some time to talk with us about her favorite books, authors, and interests</I>. <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>    I find that answers to this question change with the season. Right now, I would say that <I>Jane Eyre</I> by Charlotte Bronte and <I>Great Expectations</I> by Charles Dickens were the two books that most powerfully influenced me to write. <p>    But at other times I come up with other answers. I can't underestimate the enormous power of Hemingway's writing on me when I was a young woman, or of Virginia Woolf or of what an effect Shakespeare had on me once I was able to wallow in his writing for pleasure. One whole summer of my life was given over to reading <I>Anna Karenina</I> out loud, and that was an immense influence. <I>On the Road</I> by Jack Kerouac greatly empowered me. I can't isolate one single book. Each book broke down walls for me. Nabokov's <I>Speak, Memory</I> and <I>Lolita</I> swept me off my feet. All of this went into the brew before I really hit my stride. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>    Bear in mind that this is an "As of the Moment" list: <p>     <li><I>Anna Karinena</I> by Leo Tolstoy -- Because he wrote of women in the same way he wrote about men -- with the same devotion and detail. He was utterly impartial. He wrote of the domestic and the spiritual with the same dignity. He wrote of the sensual and the spiritual with the same clarity. I was enthralled. <p>    <li><I>The Old Curiosity Shop</I> by Charles Dickens -- I am convinced it's a piece of madness. It rambles on and on, transfixing one as Little Nell and her grandfather wander, sometimes in near hallucinatory language, describing one detailed scene after another, one comic, another tragic, all riveting. It is a spell, not a book. The writing is masterly. It is a dream. <p>    <li><I>Great Expectations</I> by Charles Dickens -- A masterpiece about the life of one character, a book greater than the author ever knew, creating a character greater than the author ever realized, in Pip, and Pip's dreams and what he learned about life through his ambitions. Beautifully crafted, and full of pain, and enduring images such as that of Mrs. Havisham in her rotted wedding dress and with her rotted wedding cake upon its cobwebbed table. <p>    <li><I>The Brothers Karamazov</I> by Fodor Dostoevsky -- Characters of immense spirit, dashing to and fro, disclaiming madly from their souls, the plot whirling -- the whole so spiritually beyond the ambitions of our American novels as to leave us utterly shaken after we read it. A goad, a conflagration. <p>    <li><I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> by Ernest Hemingway -- A complete fantasy presented as reality; exquisitely crafted, perhaps the highest achievement of Hemingway's novels, and one of the most engulfing. You can slip into its world. I learned much from it. <p>    <li><I>Jane Eyre</I> by Charlotte Bronte -- The character of Jane leads, grips, and holds you as you travel through the levels of darkness, abuse, and humiliation; a book of stunning loneliness and suffering. The effect of it is probably mutated entirely by each passing score of years as we get farther and farther away from the time in which it was written and the great country house of Mr. Rochester becomes more and more fantastic. But the underlying theme remains the same: that Jane can survive what she has to survive if she holds to her principles. <p>    <li><I>Sons and Lovers</I> by D. H. Lawrence -- A shocking novel because it dips right into the raw world of the coal minors and their limited family existence and elevates it to the level of Shakespearean drama, full of wondrous passion, boldly and generously written. I loved it. And the ending was brutal and unforgettable. <p>    <li><I>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</I> by Carson McCullers -- A graceful, beautifully paced book which taught me to think about different points of view in a novel, and how to weave them together with respect for all, and to take my time to bring them in contact with each other, a book about alienation and loneliness, and a book full of the author's love for her characters and their predicament, a book full of particularly southern generosity and sensitively. Very lovely. Very instructive. <p>    <li><I>The Member of the Wedding</I> by Carson McCullers -- Unforgettable story of one little girl growing up in a southern town and going through an awkward stage in her life, told in the simplest words, yet so beautifully, with the characters of the black housekeeper and the little boy next door exquisitely drawn, all part of a drama that talks of love and need and hope so tenderly. Wonderful, wonderful book. Sad. Terrific. <p>    <li>The Fourth Gospel by John -- "I am the Way, the Truth and the Life." Unparalleled poetry. Strange language. Enthralling.You go back and back to it. At first you don't know why, and then you start to think about all kinds of thing, like the man who wrote it, and when and how. You realize what it contains that the other gospels don't. But the language, that's the thing. In the beginning was the Word. Yes, it was a common concept, but where do you remember reading it? In the Fourth Gospel.  <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Evita</I>, because it told the full life of a character, her rise, her demise. Madonna's performance was magical. Antonio Banderas was remarkable also. <p>    <li><I>La Dolce Vita</I> -- A life-changing film, the type of film that shakes you out of all your presumptions, cracks the frame of your existence.<p>     <I>The Godfather</I> -- Of course, the beginning of an era of American masterpieces that were equal to the earlier foreign films of the sixties. <p>    <li><I>Raging Bull</I> -- A tour-de-force for DeNiro, a symphony of violent language. <p>    <li><I>The Red Shoes</I> -- The kind of classic that sustains you through the most arid and repressive parts of your life.  <p>    <li>Kenneth Branagh's <I>Hamlet</I> -- A masterpiece. So was his <I>Henry V</I>. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I like many kinds of music, particularly baroque and classical, rock, and country and western. I never listen to music when writing. I have to hear the rhythm of my sentences. Music is too intoxicating for me to have it on most of the time. When I listen I surrender. I'm a huge fan of Beethoven, of Vivaldi, of Elvis. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  Dickens, of course, because he's too neglected now, and Kafka because more people need to know his short stories, and Hemingway's short stories because each and every one is genius, and people have forgotten that. <p>         <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  Art books -- big lush books with full color illustrations, like books on Medieval altar pieces or on the works of Sodoma, or Cranach, or Andrea del Sarto or lesser known masters; books with big richly produced illustrations of the miniatures in medieval prayer books, books that deliver works of enduring value right into your hands and into your home, books that can lie on your desk, bedside table, etc. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have open books in archaeological layers, and it takes a digger to get through them, I tell you. What a mess, but it's the way I work, searching and piling, and compiling. I'm a writer who uses books, and I love allusions. There are lots of allusions in my work, and lots of thorough research. I have fun with it, always have. <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I developed slowly and in secret. My rejection slip period lasted nine months with the manuscript of <I>Interview with the Vampire</I> and involved five rejection slips, some of which were just hilariously negative. I just went right on pushing. I think I was fortunate. But I didn't really try to be published until I was thirty-four, and had a complete book in my hands. And then that complete book was rewritten and greatly expanded after its acceptance by Knopf. <p>    My apprenticeship was really a private affair, during the years of my wandering from course to course as an unclassified graduate, reading widely and bumping into subjects at random, and typing away into the night, searching for my voice, and then "discovering" it in the character of my vampire hero, Louis. It was an eccentric path. <p>     <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Live and write as if you were already discovered. Demand respect and time for yourself as a writer as if you were already published and famous. Consider yourself a consummate professional even if you moonlight in a garage or at a kitchen table. This is how great writers are made. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>The time is now.<br><br>We are in a small room with the vampire, face to face, as he speaks&#151;as he pours out the hypnotic, shocking, moving, and erotically charged confessions of his first two hundred years as one of the living dead. . . <br><br>He speaks quietly, plainly, even gently . . . carrying us back to the night when he departed human existence as heir&#151;young, romantic, cultivated&#151;to a great Louisiana plantation, and was inducted by the radiant and sinister Lestat into the other, the &quot;endless,&quot; life . . . learning first to sustain himself on the blood of cocks and rats caught in the raffish streets of New Orleans, then on the blood of human beings . . . to the years when, moving away from his final human ties under the tutelage of the hated yet necessary Lestat, he gradually embraces the habits, hungers, feelings of vampirism&#58; the detachment, the hardened will, the &quot;superior&quot; sensual pleasures.<br><br>He carries us back to the crucial moment in a dark New Orleans street when he finds the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her, struggling against the last residue of human feeling within him . . .<br><br>We see how Claudia in turn is made a vampire&#151;all her passion and intelligence trapped forever in the body of a small child&#151;and how they arrive at their passionate and dangerous alliance, their French Quarter life of opulence&#58; delicate Grecian statues, Chinese vases, crystal chandeliers, a butler, a maid, a stone nymph in the hidden garden court . . . night curving into night with their vampire senses heightened to the beauty of the world, thirsting for the beauty of death&#151;a constant stream of vulnerable strangers awaiting them below . . . <br><br>We see them joined against the envious, dangerous Lestat, embarking on a perilous search across Europe for others like themselves, desperate to discover the world they belong to, the ways of survival, to know what they are and why, where they came from, what their future can be . . .<br><br>We follow them across Austria and Transylvania, encountering their kind in forms beyond their wildest imagining . . . to Paris, where footsteps behind them, in exact rhythm with their own, steer them to the doors of the Th&#233;&#226;tre des Vampires&#151;the beautiful, lewd, and febrile mime theatre whose posters of penny-dreadful vampires at once mask and reveal the horror within . . . to their meeting with the eerily magnetic Armand, who brings them, at last, into intimacy with a whole brilliant and decadent society of vampires, an intimacy that becomes sudden terror when they are compelled to confront what they have feared and fled . . . <br><br>In its unceasing flow of spellbinding storytelling, of danger and flight, of loyalty and treachery, <b>Interview with the Vampire</b> bears witness of a literary imagination of the first order.</p><h3>Philadelphia Inquirer</h3><p><P>"A supernatural thriller raised to the level of literature."</p><h3>Boston Globe</h3><p>"If you surrender, you will find that you have surrender to enchantment, as if in a voluptuous dream."</p><h3>Chicago Tribune</h3><p>"A magnificent, compulsively readable thriller. . . .

</div><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P>&quot;I see&#151;&quot; said the vampire thoughtfully, and slowly he walked across the room towards the window. For a long time he stood there against the dim light from Divisadero Street and the passing beams of traffic. The boy could see the furnishings of the room more clearly now, the round oak table, the chairs. A wash basin hung on one wall with a mirror. He set his briefcase on the table and waited. <br><br>&quot;But how much tape do you have with you?&quot; asked the vampire, turning now so the boy could see his profile. &quot;Enough for the story of a life?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure, if it's a good life. Sometimes I interview as many as three or four good people a night if I'm lucky. But it has to be a good story. That's only fair, isn't it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Admirably fair,&quot; the vampire answered. &quot;I would like to tell you the story of my life, then. I would like to do that very much.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great,&quot; said the boy. And quickly he removed a small tape recorder from his brief case, making a check of the cassette and batteries. &quot;I'm really anxious to hear why you believe this, why you&#151;&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; said the vampire abruptly. &quot;We can't begin that way. Is your equipment ready?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the boy.<br><br>&quot;Then sit down. I'm going to turn on the overhead light.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I thought vampires didn't like the light,&quot; said the boy. &quot;If you think the dark adds atmosphere&#151;&quot; But then he stopped. The vampire was watching him with his back to the window. The boy could make out nothing of his face now, and something about the still figure there distracted him. He started to say something again but he said nothing. And then he sighed with relief when the vampire moved towards the table and reached for the overhead cord. <br><br>At once the room was flooded with a harsh yellow light. And the boy, staring up at the vampire, could not repress a gasp. His fingers danced backwards on the table to grasp the edge. &quot;Dear God!&quot; he whispered, and then he gazed, speechless, at the vampire.<br><br>The vampire was utterly white and smooth, as if he were sculpted from bleached bone, and his face was as seemingly inanimate as a statue, except for two brilliant green eyes that looked down at the boy intently like flames in a skull. But then the vampire smiled almost wistfully, and the smooth white substance of his face moved with the infinitely flexible but minimal lines of a cartoon. &quot;Do you see?&quot; he asked softly?<br><br>The boy shuddered, lifting his hand as if to shield himself from a powerful light. His eyes moved slowly over the finely tailored black coat he'd only glimpsed in the bar, the long folds of the cape, the black silk tie knotted at the throat, and the gleam of the white collar that was as white as the vampire's flesh. He stared at the vampire's full black hair, the waves that were combed back over the tips of the ears, the curls that barely touched the edge of the white collar.<br><br>&quot;Now, do you still want the interview?&quot; the vampire asked.<br><br>The boy's mouth was open before the sound came out. He was nodding. Then he said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>The vampire sat down slowly opposite him and, leaning forward, said gently, confidentially, &quot;Don't be afraid. Just start the tape.&quot;<br><br>And then he reached out over the length of the table. The boy recoiled, sweat running down the sides of his face. The vampire clamped a hand on the boy's shoulder and said, &quot;Believe me, I won't hurt you. I want this opportunity. It's more important to me than you can realize now. I want you to begin.&quot; And he withdrew his hand and sat collected, waiting.<br><br>It took a moment for the boy to wipe his forehead and his lips with a handkerchief, to stammer that the microphone was in the machine, to press the button, to say that the machine was on.<br><br>&quot;You weren't always a vampire, were you?&quot; he began.<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; answered the vampire. &quot;I was a twenty-five-year-old man when I became a vampire, and the year was seventeen ninety-one.&quot;<br><br>The boy was startled by the preciseness of the date and he repeated it before he asked, &quot;How did it come about?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There's a simple answer to that. I don't believe I want to give simple answers,&quot; said the vampire. &quot;I think I want to tell the real story&#151;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; the boy said quickly. He was folding his handkerchief over and over and wiping his lips now with it again.<br><br>&quot;There was a tragedy&#151;&quot; the vampire started. &quot;It was my younger brother&#151;. He died.&quot; And then he stopped, so that the boy could clear his throat and wipe at his face again before stuffing the handkerchief almost impatiently into his pocket.<br><br>&quot;It's not painful, is it?&quot; he asked timidly.<br><br>&quot;Does it seem so?&quot; asked the vampire. &quot;No.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;It's simply that I've only told this story to one other person. And that was so long ago. No, it's not painful&#151;.<br><br>&quot;We were living in Louisiana then. We'd received a land grant and settled two indigo plantations on the Mississippi very near New Orleans&#151;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, that's the accent&#151;&quot; the boy said softly.<br><br>For a moment the vampire stared blankly. &quot;I have an accent?&quot; He began to laugh.<br><br>And the boy, flustered, answered quickly. &quot;I noticed it in the bar when I asked you what you did for a living. It's just a slight sharpness to the consonants, that's all. I never guessed it was French.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's all right,&quot; the vampire assured him. &quot;I'm not as shocked as I pretend to be. It's only that I forget it from time to time. But let me go on&#151;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Please&#151;&quot; said the boy.<br><br>&quot;I was talking about the plantations. They had a great deal to do with it, really, my becoming a vampire. But I'll come to that. Our life there was both luxurious and primitive. And we ourselves found it extremely attractive. You see, we lived far better there than we could have ever lived in France. Perhaps the sheer wilderness of Louisiana only made it seem so, but seeming so, it was. I remember the imported furniture that cluttered the house.&quot; The vampire smiled. &quot;And the harpsichord; that was lovely. My sister used to play it. On summer evenings, she would sit at the keys with her back to the open French windows. And I can still remember that thin, rapid music and the vision of the swamp rising beyond her, the moss-hung cypresses floating against the sky. And there were the sounds of the swamp, a chorus of creatures, the cry of the birds. I think we loved it. It made the rosewood furniture all the more precious, the music more delicate and desirable. Even when the wisteria tore the shutters off the attic windows and worked its tendrils right into the whitewashed brick in less that a year&#151; Yes, we loved it. All except my brother. I don't think I ever heard him complain of anything, but I knew how he felt. My father was dead then, and I was head of the family and I had to defend him constantly from my mother and sister. They wanted to take him visiting, and to New Orleans for parties, but he hated these things. I think he stopped going altogether before he was twelve. Prayer was what mattered to him, prayer and his leatherbound lives of the saints.<br><br>&quot;Finally, I built him an oratory removed from the house, and he began to spend most of every day there and often the early evening. It was ironic, really. He was so different from us, so different from everyone, and I was so regular! There was nothing extraordinary about me whatsoever.&quot; The vampire smiled.<br><br>&quot;Sometimes in the evening I would go out to him and find him in the garden near the oratory, sitting absolutely composed on a stone bench there, and I'd tell him my troubles, the difficulties I had with the slaves, how I distrusted the overseer or the weather or my brokers&#151; all the problems that made up the length and breadth of my existence. And he would always listen, making only a few comments, always sympathetic, so that when I left him I had the distinct impression he had solved everything for me. I didn't think I could deny him anything, and I vowed that no matter how it would break my heart to lose him, he could enter the priesthood when the time came. Of course, I was wrong.&quot; The vampire stopped.<br><br>For a moment the boy only gazed at him and then he started as if awakened from a deep thought, and he floundered, as if he could not find the right words. &quot;Ah&#151; he didn't want to be a priest?&quot; the boy asked. The vampire studied him as if trying to discern to meaning of his expression. Then he said&#58; <br><br>&quot;I meant that I was wrong about myself, about my not denying him anything.&quot; His eyes moved over the far wall and fixed on the panes of the window. &quot;He began to see visions.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Real visions?&quot; the boy asked, but again there was hesitation, as if he were thinking of something else.<br><br>&quot;I don't think so,&quot; the vampire answered. &quot;It happened when he was fifteen. He was very handsome then. He had the smoothest skin and the largest blue eyes. He was robust, not thin as I am now and was then&#151; but his eyes&#151; it was as if when I looked into his eyes I was standing alone on the edge of the world&#151; on a windswept ocean beach. There was nothing but the soft roar of the waves. <br><br>Well,&quot; he said, his eyes still fixed on the window panes, &quot;he began to see visions. He only hinted at this at first, and he stopped taking his meals altogether. He lived in the oratory. At any hour of day or night, I could find him on the bare flagstones kneeling before the altar. And the oratory itself was neglected. He stopped tending the candle or changing the altar clothes or even sweeping out the leaves. One night I became really alarmed when I stood in the rose arbor watching him for one solid hour, during which he never moved from his knees and never once lowered his arms, which he held outstretched in the form of a cross. The slaves all thought he was mad.&quot; The vampire raised his eyebrows in wonder. &quot;I was convinced that he was only... overzealous. That in his love for God, he had perhaps gone too far. Then he told me about the visions. Both St. Dominic and the Blessed Virgin Mary had come to him in the oratory. They had told him he was to sell all our property in Louisiana, everything we owned, and use the money to do God's work in France. My brother was to be a great religious leader, to return the country to its former fervor, to turn the tide against atheism and the Revolution. Of course, he had no money of his own. I was to sell the plantations and our town houses in New Orleans and give the money to him.&quot;<br><br>Again the vampire stopped. And the boy sat motionless regarding him, astonished. &quot;Ah&#151; excuse me,&quot; he whispered. &quot;What did you say? Did you sell the plantations?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; said the vampire, his face calm as it has been from the start. &quot;I laughed at him. And he&#151; he became incensed. He insisted his command came from the Virgin herself. Who was I to disregard it? Who indeed?&quot; he asked softly, as if he were thinking of this again. &quot;Who indeed? And the more he tried to convince me, the more I laughed. It was nonsense, I told him, the product of an immature and even morbid mind. The oratory was a mistake, I said to him; I would have it torn down at once. He would go to school in New Orleans and get such inane notions out of his head. I don't remember all that I said. But I remember the feeling. Behind all this contemptuous dismissal on my part was a smoldering anger and a disappointment. I was bitterly disappointed. I didn't believe him at all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But that's understandable,&quot; said the boy quickly when the vampire paused, his expression of astonishment softening. &quot;I mean, would anyone have believed him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is it so understandable?&quot; The vampire looked at the boy. &quot;I think perhaps it was vicious egotism. Let me explain. I loved my brother, as I told you, and at times I believed him to be a living saint. I encouraged him in his prayer and mediations, as I said, and I was willing to give him up to the priesthood. And if someone had told me of a saint in Arles or Lourdes who saw visions, I would have believed it. I was a Catholic; I believed in saints. I lit tapers before their statues in churches; I know their pictures, their symbols, their names. But I didn't, I couldn't believe my brother. Not only did I not believe he saw visions, I wouldn't entertain the notion for a moment. Now, why? Because he was my brother. Holy he might be, peculiar most definitely; but Francis of Assisi, no. Not my brother. No brother of mine could be such. That is egotism. Do you see?&quot;<br><br>The boy thought about it before he answered and then he nodded and said that yes, he thought that he did.<br><br>&quot;Perhaps he saw the visions,&quot; said the vampire.<br><br>&quot;Then you&#151; you don't claim to know&#151; now&#151; whether he did or not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, but I do know that he never wavered in his conviction for a second. That I know now and knew then the night he left my room crazed and grieved. He never wavered for an instant. And within minutes, he was dead.&quot;</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="product-related"><div class="btb-dsl-tc"><div class="btb-dsl-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-tc-acc"><div class="pr-width"><div class="wrap2lt"><h3 class="pr-selected accord-default-open"><a name="relatedAcc" href="#categoryTitle_Acc" data-cmelementid="Related Subjects_Accordion">Related Subjects</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on"><ul><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=13">Literary Styles &amp; Movements - Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=1492914">Books at the Movies</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=716215">Teen Fiction - Horror &amp; Suspense</a></li></ul></div><div class="wrap2lt booksByThisAuthor"><h3 class="pr-selected"><a name="booksByThisAuthorAcc" href="#booksByThisAuthor_Acc" data-cmelementid="BooksByThisAuthor_Accordion" onclick="WebService.initialize({url:'http://services.barnesandnoble.com/v02_00/ProductSearch?Contributor=Anne+Rice&amp;ProductType=Book&amp;ProductSort=Relevance&amp;ProductDetail=Brief&amp;Start=1&amp;Size=6&amp;AppId=bntemp&amp;bnoutput=jsonstring&amp;bncallback=webservicecallback', outputNode:document.getElementById('obbta'), StyleSheet:genericStyleSheet, moreLink:'http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Anne+Rice', isBTOB:'false', ean:'9780345337665'});">More by This Author</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on" id="obbta"><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif" alt="loading animation"> loading...
