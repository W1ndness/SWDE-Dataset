											In Montana, Eve Reynolds knows that when she was a human she was a doormat; but now as a Chanku she has become a strong female.  Her soulmate Adam ells her he loves her though both are upset that she remains non-pregnant.  Eve drives to town but loses track of the road and crashes.  Her last thought was a cry to Adam.  Anton informs Adam Eve died.  Adam blames himself for not going with her.  <p/><p/>Eve wakes up to see the Goddess Liana and asks why she failed her, but gets no response.  There is room for one Goddess and the Mother has selected Eve.  She visits Adam while he sleeps and tells she has a new purpose and he must move on.  Adam tries to commit suicide but Eve and Liana save his life.  Eve tells Adam to teach Liana how to live as a mortal.  Liana knows the pack loath her; she regrets not looking out for the Chanku.  <p/><p/>Adam rages at everyone even his best friends Mei and Oliver before attacking her only to be assaulted and raped by him.  Liana knows she failed Eve and deserves Adam's hatred though she loves him.  The Chandu begin to see Liana's failures in new light.  All forgive her except Adam.   However, they work together as healers to include helping Igmutaka the spirit guide cougar.  When Liana and Adam have sex she realizes she cannot stay with the Chanku any longer even as an inferno bears down on the lodge.<p/><p/>The story line refreshes the entire saga as a prime star dies with a super twist.  As always the ensemble cast comes across as always as different fully developed characters in and out of the sex scenes; of which there are plenty of diverse trysts.  Although the suspense is somewhat limited for what is expected of the Wolf Pack Big Sky romantic fantasy, readers will enjoy the latest entry in a strong saga.<p/><p/>Harriet Klausner</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>A Life For A Life<P>The Chanku are gifted with more power&#151;of mind, body, and soul&#151;than the most superior of humans.

Who needed handcuffs  when there was hard iron to wrap her fingers around?  <p>     And a gorgeous guy ready and willing to have his evil  way with her?  <p>     She had to bite back the giggles, but damn this was  great.  <p>     It was so rarely just the two of them. She'd almost forgotten  what it was like to be the entire focus of Adam's attention,  but Mei was working in the garden with Keisha,  and she'd last seen Oliver heading across the driveway to  the main house to talk to Anton.  <p>     But why was she wasting her time, thinking of them?  <p>     Not now. Not when she was naked and quivering with  need and Adam was still partially dressed, wearing nothing  but faded jeans and a sexy grin. She licked her lips, admiring  him. Letting him know exactly what it did to her to  see him this way.  <p>     Powerful muscles rippled over his chest and arms. His  belly was flat and hard, the sharply defined six-pack accented  by a trail of dark blond hair that grew darker, as it  followed a line from between his copper-colored nipples,  down the center of that gorgeous belly to disappear beneath  the half-opened placket of his worn Levis.  <p>     He knelt between her thighs and ran his strong, callused  hands from her knees to her hipbones. She whimpered  with the pleasure of his touch, loving the way his  work-roughened hands glided over her sensitive skin, the  strength in his long fingers, the energy that always seemed  to arc between the two of them when they touched.  <p>     Adam might be a powerful healer, one who fixed what  was broken, but damn, he was an even more powerful  lover. Especially now, in the bright morning light while the  rest of the pack went about their normal morning routines.  <p>     There was something decidedly decadent about lying  here naked on the bed with sunlight streaming through the  windows and such a gorgeous man between her legs. Soft  denim over his hard muscles rubbed against her inner  thighs and sent shivers through her body. Dark blond hair  curling out above the unfastened steel buttons of his fly  teased her with the hint of what lay beyond.  <p>     Adam tugged at the blond curls between her legs. Eve  twisted her hips, silently begging for more.  <p>     He flashed her a knowing smile as he slipped his warm  palms beneath her butt and raised her up until her legs  dangled over his forearms. Raised her closer to that smile,  those lips, that amazing tongue.  <p>     He nuzzled the blond curls covering her mons, inhaled  deeply and mentally shared the rich scent of her arousal.  The connection was always there, that amazing mind link  they'd forged when they finally mated as wolves. As sensual,  as familiar as their shared arousal had become, she  wondered if she would ever grow used to such a powerful  union, to the sense that she was in him, a part of him even  as he was part of her.  <p>     His tongue touched her clitoris, a quick little lick that  still managed to send a strike of lighting straight to her  womb.  <p>     She could have been growing a baby there, but it hadn't  happened. Not the one time they'd tried to conceive-that  magical night late in the spring when Tia's babies were  born-but she refused to let her disappointment ruin this  glorious fall morning. She focused on Adam, on his magical  touch and the deep sense of his love.  <p>     Arousal blossomed. Desire primed the quick rush of her  fluids. Adam groaned when he licked her, taking long,  slow strokes with the flat of his tongue that quickly had  her quivering in his grasp. His lips circled her clit, swollen  now and slick with cream.  <p>     <i>Close.</i> Dear Goddess, she was so close, but he stopped  and lowered her butt to the bed, leaned over and kissed  her mouth. She ran her tongue over his lower lip, then the  upper, tasting Adam. Tasting herself. Her fingers tightened  on the iron bars.  <p>     He backed away, grinning like the amber-eyed devil he  was. Eve returned his knowing look with one of her own.  She might have been a doormat for most of her life, but  not anymore. Not now. Now she was a Chanku bitch, more  powerful than she'd ever imagined. Self-assured, confident,  complete.  <p>     If she wanted to open the rest of that button fly on his  jeans, she could. If she wanted to turn the tables and  mount him, it was her call, but she loved this game, this  playful lovemaking that took her higher than she'd ever  imagined. So instead of calling the shots and taking what  she wanted, Eve clutched the iron bars in almost desperate  need, arched her back and whimpered.  <p>     He laughed. The deep joy in his voice, the sparkle in his  eyes forged an even stronger bond between them. He used  both hands to shove his tangled, dark blond hair out of his  eyes. "Eve, my beautiful Eve. What would I ever do without  you?"  <p>     He stared at her a moment as if he didn't dare even contemplate  such a thought. Why should he? She was his. She  would always be his. Teasing, she bucked her hips against  him. He shucked his jeans in a heartbeat, grabbed the  thick length of his erection in his hand and pressed between  her legs.  <p>     The slick mushroom head forced her swollen lips apart.  She arched her hips just so, taking him deep. Thick and  long and hot-so amazingly hot-he filled her. Pressing  closer, deeper, until the dark blond hairs at the base of his  cock meshed with her lighter thatch.  <p>     She groaned and tightened her fingers around the iron  bars until her hands ached, but it was good. So damned  good. So much better than she'd ever imagined. Than  she'd ever dreamed.  <p>     "I love you, Eve." His lips moved along her jaw, over  the curve of her ear, kissing her gently while he drove into  her with almost painful force. Claiming her.  <p>     Owning her.  <p>     "You're mine," he whispered. "Forever."  <p>     A chill raced along her spine, cold and unwelcome. She  shrugged it off, arched her hips and hung on to love for all  she was worth.  <p>  <p>     Eve wiped steam off the bathroom mirror, shoved her  wet hair over her shoulders and frowned at her image. The  face of a contented, well-loved, <i>pregnant</i> woman should  be staring right back at her.  <p>     <i>Definitely well-loved.</i> Just thinking of how she and  Adam had spent the morning made all her feminine muscles  clench in response, but as far as being pregnant?  <p>     <i>Maybe tonight.</i> Her heat was due.  <p>     <i>Maybe this time I'll get it right ...</i>  <p>     Lisa Quinn had gotten it right. She'd popped out an egg  right on time and now she and Tinker were expecting their  very first baby in just four more months. Even Tala had  figured it out, though how that tiny little thing was going  to bear twins to two big bruisers like Mik and AJ boggled  the mind.  <p>     But Eve? Nope, not her. She shrugged and grinned at  her reflection. Typical. If anyone was going to blow it, she  was the one, though she still wasn't quite sure where she'd  gone wrong. Everything had felt right. The sex as wolves  that night in the forest, her body ripe with her heat and  Adam so emotionally high after helping Tia deliver, had  been amazing. Her hormones were certainly pumping and  her heart had felt so full after Tia's babies were born,  things couldn't have been more perfect. And, as always,  Adam had left her smiling.  <p>     She just wished he'd left her pregnant. Thank the goddess  Adam wasn't upset. In fact, if anything, he'd acted  more relieved than disappointed when she'd told him they  hadn't conceived, but with both Tala and Lisa expecting  their babies around the same time, he probably figured  he'd have enough on his hands helping Logan with deliveries.  <p>     The last thing he'd want was his own mate pregnant  and needy at the same time as Tala and Lisa, especially  now that Anton had built the clinic here in Montana. Both  women had already said they'd be coming here to deliver,  the same as Tia had last April.  <p>     Which was why Eve hadn't brought it up again through  the long, busy summer. Logan and Adam had certainly  had their hands full delivering Tia's twins. Adam could be  so damned focused at times, so busy taking care of everyone  else Eve sometimes wondered if he even remembered  he had a mate. Not that he didn't love her. He did. She  knew she was in his head and his heart most of the time,  especially when they made love. When they linked, his  love was strong and true, and she never had cause to  doubt him.  <p>     But she'd learned to accept the man as he was, and  Adam was, first and foremost, a healer.  <p>     It hadn't taken Eve long to realize that if she wanted his  attention, she'd just have to reach out and take it. If she  wanted his baby, she figured she'd have to take control  there, too. After a lifetime of abuse, it was an empowering  thing, to know she could take control without losing her  man's love.  <p>     All her adult life she'd been attracted to the bad boys.  Whether it was her conviction that they somehow needed  her to love them, that she could find their warmer, nurturing  side, or what, she'd ended up as a doormat and punching  bag for every single one of them.  <p>     <i>Until Adam.</i> He was a bad boy, all right, and sometimes  rough around the edges, but good where it counted. She  never had to fear him, never had to wonder if he was  going to hurt her. That alone was empowering.  <p>     Eve checked her lipstick, grabbed her purse off the big  bed and headed down the hallway to the front door.  <p>     A scream stopped her. Primal. Agonizing.  <p>     <i>Male.</i>  <p>     Eve jerked to a stop with her hand on the door. <i>Adam?</i>  <p>     Her heart pounded. She spun around and raced through  the living room to the media room beyond. Terrified of  what she'd find, she burst through the door into the darkened  room.  <p>     Adam lay flat on his back on the floor, arms spread  wide, a video game controller clutched in his fingers.  <p>     Oliver stood beside him, doubled over with his hands  on his knees, laughing hysterically.  <p>     Adam moaned.  <p>     "No!" Oliver barely got the word out. "You can't moan.  You're dead."  <p>     "Good Goddess!" Eve leaned against the door jamb with  her hand pressed to her thundering heart. "You scared me  half to death! I heard you scream and thought something  terrible had happened."  <p>     Adam raised his head and grinned at her. "Something  terrible did happen. That's the third time in a row the bastard's  killed me. I'm getting tired of always being the one  who dies."  <p>     "And does dishes," Oliver added. "That's three nights  you owe me." He held out a hand. Adam grabbed hold  and Oliver tugged the larger man to his feet. "It works for  me."  <p>     "You up for another game?" Adam palmed the controller  and aimed it at Oliver.  <p>     "Always. I love a good loser."  <p>     Eve took a deep, controlling breath and slung her purse  over her shoulder. "Don't ever do that to me again! You  scared me half to death. Look, I promised Xandi I'd make  a run to town. She's low on diapers for Alex, plus she  needs a few things for dinner. Adam, you want to go with  me?"  <p>     He shook his head. "Are you kidding? With my honor  on the line?" He strolled across the room, his tall, lanky  frame taking her breath as only Adam could. Leaning  down, he kissed her. His fingers traced the line of her jaw  as his lips melded perfectly to hers.  <p>     Eve felt the kiss all the way to her toes, though as always,  it settled in that ever-needy spot between her legs.  <p>     After an entire morning of sex, she still wanted more.  <p>     "You sure you have to go to town?" His question was  nothing more than a breathy whisper against her mouth.  <p>     "Yes." She smiled against his lips and ended the kiss,  even though her body cried out to stay and see just what  else Adam had in mind. Oliver, too, for that matter. She  shook her head in mock dismay. "Far be it from me to interfere  with the reclamation of your honor." She turned to  leave, but glanced over her shoulder at Oliver. "Oliver, be  gentle with him. His ego can't take much more."  <p>     "You're kidding, right?" Oliver jabbed Adam with his  elbow.  <p>     Both men were laughing when she closed the door behind  her. With Xandi's grocery list tucked in her pocket,  Eve crossed the driveway to the little red convertible Volkswagen  bug she shared with Mei. A soft breeze lifted her  hair and the hazy late September sun made her squint. She  plucked her dark glasses out of her purse and put them on  as she slipped into the driver's seat.  <p>     The morning had been cool, but now the leather upholstery  felt warm against her legs and back. Cicadas hummed  in the trees along the drive. She sat there for a moment in  the driveway, just listening to the familiar sounds that always  gave her such pleasure&#58; Keisha's laughter and Lily's  giggles, Xandi's soft voice as she sang the Barney song to  Alex. A phone rang in the big house. Eve's sensitive Chanku  hearing caught Anton's deep voice as he answered. A raven  flew overhead, its long, black wings sounding almost mechanical  in flight.  <p>     She heard a rustle in the grass to her right, and looked  up just in time to see a fox carefully picking its way  through the dry weeds along the forest edge. A large doe  with two speckled fawns at her side grazed in the strip of  greenery between the houses and the deep woods.  <p>     The sense of peace that settled over Eve brought tears  to her eyes. After so many years with abusive men, so  many lost years when she'd barely managed to survive-this  life, this beautiful home and this amazing group, this  pack of Chanku shapeshifters that welcomed her as one of  them, who loved her unconditionally-was more than  she'd ever hoped for.  <p>     More than she'd even known to want, yet now all of it  was hers. Life was good. So good, in fact, that sometimes  it made her nervous for things to feel so perfect.  <p>     Which was downright stupid. She needed to be more  like Tala and learn to live in the moment, because this moment,  right now, was great. Smiling with the conviction  that life just couldn't get any better, Eve started the car and  followed the curve of the long driveway. She loved driving  into town, especially when it was warm enough to drive  with the top down on the bug.  <p>     It was especially nice being able to go by herself.  <p>     Not that she didn't love the pack. No, she loved them  all. Adam, of course, but Anton and Keisha, Stefan and  Xandi, Jazzy and Logan, and Mei and Oliver as well. They  were the family she'd dreamed of having one day, friends  and lovers who accepted her for who and what she was.  <p>     Even so, loving and being loved, she still needed time by  herself. Time when she could count her blessings and think  of all that she had as much as all she'd escaped.  <p>     Sometimes she ran alone as the wolf, but that always  made Adam nervous, especially since she'd once been so  badly injured by a grizzly that still roamed the area. Adam  had saved her life then. Saved her and loved her and made  her love him back.  <p>     At least when she went into town on errands, Adam  didn't worry. Didn't feel as if he needed to be with her  every moment. Now that the attacks against the Chanku  had ended, these shopping runs saved her sanity.  <p>     Togetherness was good, but a girl needed her space.  <p>     She sped down the highway toward town. The breeze  was cool and fresh, the sun warm on her head and shoulders.  It was late enough in the year that the tourists had  mostly gone home, so the traffic was light. The day couldn't  be more perfect.  <p>     Smiling as her hair whipped around her shoulders, Eve  reached for the radio and flipped it on. Loud heavy metal  blared out of the speakers.  <p>     Laughing, she fiddled with the channel. Obviously Mei  had been the last one to drive the bug. She was the only  one in the pack who really liked the stuff. Eve glanced at  the radio to check the station. A horn blared. She looked  up.  <p>     Directly into the grillwork of a huge truck.  <p>     She'd drifted into oncoming traffic.  <p>     Eve jerked the wheel to the right, but the Freightliner  barreling down on her clipped the left front panel of the  bug, spinning it out of control. She slammed her foot  down on the brake. Tires squealed. The little car skidded,  hit the berm at the right side of the road and flipped, end  over end.  <p>     Light and color spun. Sound and time compressed into  a kaleidoscope of sensation. For Eve, time ceased to exist.  <p>     She was going to die. She knew it with a deep, soulful  regret. She'd never been so happy. Had never known such  peace.  <p>     If only she could have held on to it just a little longer.  <p>     Time resurfaced. The ground rushed up to meet her. She  screamed a single word, her final word before death reached  out to claim her. A word powered with love.  <p>     His name.  <p>     "Adam!"  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Wolf Tales 10</b> by <b>KATE DOUGLAS</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Kate Douglas.
