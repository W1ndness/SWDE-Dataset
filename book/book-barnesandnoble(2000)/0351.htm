She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness.<p>In nineteenth-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication&#58; nu shu ("women�s writing"). Some girls were paired with laotongs, "old sames," in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.<p>With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become "old sames" at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion...</p><h3>The New York Times - 
												Janet Maslin</h3><p><i>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</i> is written with a stately but unremarkable prettiness; it is not a book that will make its mark for reasons of style. But Ms. See has worked enough joy, pain and dramatic weepiness ("Oh, how I wanted to dip a cloth into that water and wipe away the cares that played across my laotong's features") to give it a quiet staying power. It's liable to be read by women's groups and valued for its quaintness. ("All people cherish the hair on their moles, but Uncle Lu's were splendid.") But what will work best for this book is its own secret message: cultures vary, but old sames and same-olds don't change.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>Lisa See may not appear to fit the standard conception of a Chinese-American woman, but her deep roots in her Chinese background have set her on a path leading her to being one of the most significant Asian-American voices in contemporary writing.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><div id="flashcontent"></div><SCRIPT language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://natalie.feedroom.com/fr_embed.js"></SCRIPT><SCRIPT type="text/javascript">

											I was amazed at how much I loved this book! I admit I was reluctant to read it at first. However, from page 1 - I was HOOKED. It was so compelling and absorbing, I found myself staying up into the wee hours because I couldn't put it down. This is one of those stories that has characters that stay with you for a very long time. It is so moving and powerful in its depiction of Chinese culture and tradition, but most of all it opens your eyes to the power of beliefs, love, family and a special friendship that warms your heart.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Help/Kathryn-Stockett/e/9780399155345/?pv=y">The Help</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>SHOCKING!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Lannie">Lannie</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1404551_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780812968064_BK_24_1404551" href="#previewReview_1404551" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 14, 2010: 
											Lily's words detail experiences in her life that will break your heart. The excruciating pain of foot-binding, the secluded life hidden away from men, and the necessity of creating their own secret language, were endured by the women in this culture. This is shocking how women are so devalued in this 19th century Chinese culture!! It reveals a culture that makes you shake your head with disbelief and makes you feel blessed to be living in America in the 21st century!! So much pain and heartbreak and so eye-opening!

Although she is only 1/8 Chinese, her upbringing provided her with a powerful connection to that fraction of herself. "I really grew up in this very traditional, old Chinese family," she revealed in an interview with Barnes & Noble.com. "It was very traditional, but also quite magical in a lot of ways, because I really was in a very different culture then how I looked." <p>    See's Chinese background was not the only aspect of her family that affected the course her life has taken. She also comes from a long line of writers and novelists. Her somewhat morose relatives initially led her to believe that writing must be the result of suffering and pain, which turned her off from literary pursuits at first. Ironically, despite her strong family roots, See only decided to try her hand at writing as a means of embarking on a lifestyle without roots. "I knew three things," See said, "I never wanted to get married, I never wanted to have children, and I only wanted to live out of a suitcase. How am I gonna do it? And I was really thinking about it, and then one morning, I woke up, and it was truly like a light bulb went off -- �Oh, I could be a writer!' Many, many years later, here I am, married, I have children, [and] I am a writer." <p>    In the wake of this unexpected epiphany, Lisa See began work on her first book <I>On Gold Mountain: The One-Hundred-Year Odyssey of My Chinese-American Family</I>. This highly detailed family history charted the events that led her great-grandfather Fong See to become the godfather of her Chinatown neighborhood and the 100-year-old patriarch of her family. See interviewed close to 100 of her relatives while researching the book that both gave her a clearer portrait of how her racially mixed family developed and broke her into the publishing business. <p>    See then went on to explore other aspects of both Chinese and American culture via fiction. She followed her debut with a series of popular political thrillers set in China and featuring American attorney David Stark. Her novel <I>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</I> abandons Stark and his pursuit of justice for the time being with a tale that reaches much further back into Chinese culture, and more specifically, the subordinate role women have traditionally played in that culture. This more personal novel scored See accolades from <I>The Washington Post</I>, <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Publisher's Weekly</I>, and <I>The School Library Journal</I>, while also further solidifying her role as a significant Chinese-American writer. And See's <I>Peony in Love</I> (2007) is a jarring historical novel set against the backdrop of an early-17th-century Chinese opera<p>    See's position in the Chinese-American community has also extended beyond her writing. She was honored by the Organization of Chinese American Women as National Woman of the Year in 2001 and is also responsible for designing a walking tour of her Chinatown home in L.A. Her devotion to that apparently-small, but actually-vast, 1/8 of her ethnicity proves that well-worn adage about never judging a book by looking at its cover. <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>In our interview, See shared lots of fun facts and anecdotes about herself, including: </I> <p>    <b>"I asked my husband what he thought was an interesting fact about me</b>, and he said that he always thought it was strange that when we first met I had to drink three cups of coffee before I got out of bed, but that after I got pregnant I never ever had another cup of coffee again. That didn't seem terribly exciting, so I asked my sister. She said that I take perverse pleasure in grossing people out, which I do. But this didn't seem very interesting either. I asked my mother and she remembered that I'd been a demon crawler and had once crawled away from the house, down to a busy boulevard, and was rescued by a couple of barbers. So I was a demon crawler and probably took ten years off my mother's life that day, but was it a fun fact? I've even asked some other people and they all have talked about my desire to travel and the scary places I have traveled alone. While I know that I'm a compulsive traveler, a lot of other people love to travel, so it still doesn't seem that unusual to me." <p>    <b>"I never wanted to be a writer</b>. My mother and my grandfather were both writers. When I was a kid, they both took the position that writing was about suffering and pain, so you can see why I didn't want to be a writer. There came a time when I was about twenty and living in Greece, and I knew three things: I didn't want to get married, I didn't want to have children, and I only wanted to live out of a suitcase. But how was I going to support myself and how was this ever going to happen? One morning I woke up and it was like a light bulb went off: �Ah, I could be a writer.' Within twenty-four hours of returning back to the States I had my first two magazine assignments. But if you've been reading this at all closely, you know that I got married and had children. And thank God, because I would have been a pretty boring person and not a very good writer if I didn't have those three people in my life. But I still do love to live out of a suitcase and have been writing most of these answers on a plane from Shanghai to San Francisco."<p>    <b>"I think one of the strangest things about me is the way I read books</b>. This dates back to when I started reading chapter books as a kid and continues to this day. I read the first 20 pages, then the last 20 pages. After that, the second 20 pages and the penultimate 20 pages. I read from front to back and from back to front until I meet in the middle. Why? I can't stand not knowing what happens to the characters. Will they be okay? Will they live? Will they get together? It doesn't take away from the suspense or ruin the story for me in any way. Not doing it would ruin the story because I would have to rush and I'd be so anxious that I wouldn't be able to do anything else until I was done." <p>    <b>"I'm a movie fanatic. I see more than 100 movies a year</b>. Sometimes I'll see two or three movies in a day. Between this and reading books the way I do, I have a very good sense of plot.  I can watch the first five minutes of any television show and the first ten minutes of just about any movie and tell you everything that will happen. It's very rare that I'm taken by complete surprise. But to me it isn't about the surprise. I'm just curious to see how things have been structured, if the right clues have been doled out, and if the right people will get together."    <p>    <b>"I like to eat, but I don't like to cook. I'll eat anything and have</b> -- a low point would have to be the stir-fried pig penis in China -- but there are only three things I won't eat: lima beans, brains, and kidneys. I hate exercise, but I love to play tennis, walk, and hike. I love stories in any form: film, books, song, and TV. Yes, I'm a real couch potato! I'm a nut for reality shows like �Survivor' and �American Idol.' My three favorite shows this season are �The OC,' �Lost,'and �Battlestar Gallactica.' And I'm a not-so-closet Trekkie. (Yes, I've even been to Star Trek conventions, but I blame that on my sons.) For so long I would say I hated sci-fi, and then I finally realized that it was one of my favorite genres. Go figure. My favorite way to unwind? That would have to be sleeping, hands down. I love to sleep and I take it very seriously. We recently got a Temperpedic mattress and it's my favorite purchase ever. I long to go to bed and feel enveloped."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3>In 2005, Lisa See took some time out to answer some of our questions: </I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  <I>Angle of Repose</I> by Wallace Stegner. I read this novel just before I started writing <I>On Gold Mountain</I>. I loved the way Stegner combined family story with history. I know that this book has come under severe criticism in recent years for possible plagiarism. Nevertheless, it inspired and continues to inspire me. In fact, I used a quote from the book as the epigraph for <I>On Gold Mountain</I>. "Fooling around in the papers my grandparents, especially my grandmother, left behind, I get glimpses of lives close to mine, related to mine in ways I recognize but don't completely comprehend. I'd like to live in their clothes a while..." Even now, those words resonate with me, since I too spent many years in the papers and photographs that my grandmother left behind. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li><I>The Handyman</I> by Carolyn See -- Carolyn's my mom and this is my favorite novel that she's written. It's about a young man who wants to be an artist but is killing time by being a handyman until he can start art school. Along the way he discovers Los Angeles, love, what his subject should be in art, and what it means to be an artist. I feel that I've been on that journey myself. It's a great story for anyone who wants to be an artist or wants to know more about what it takes to become an artist. <p>    <li><I>The Jungle Book</I> series, by Rudyard Kipling -- Many of my favorite books are those I read as a child.  Every Saturday morning, I used to treat myself by reading "Rikki-Tikki Tavi," the first of the short stories in Volume II. I loved the way Kipling played with the fragility of life and the bravery of the mongoose, but I have to say I was entranced by all of the characters in both volumes. I think my feelings had a lot to do with being transported to another land. I always hated the Disney version, though. <p>    <li><I>Howard's End</I> by E. M. Forster -- Probably the greatest novel in the English language ever written: "Only connect." With those two simple words Forster got to the heart of human need and desire. He wrote, "Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height." I've tried to live this way myself, and with my new novel I tried to show it in the characters of Lily and Snow Flower. <p>    <li><I>The Kitchen God's Wife</I> by Amy Tan -- I know Amy and love all of her books. This one I listened to on tape. Amy read it. There's a place in the story where the main character is talking about her little boy dying. As Amy read, her voice broke. Later she told me she was really surprised when that happened and was even more surprised that the producers left it in. But I'm glad they did. I didn't cry at all when I was writing <I>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</I>, but when I read it to my husband I cried. The same had happened with Amy. I don't know what that means about the writing process. Maybe we're so involved in the story and are working from such a deep place that the tears don't come. But later it's surprising when the emotions break through -- sometimes at places that I never expect. It's as though I lived the moment of Snow Flower dying. <p>    <li><I>Ameliaranne and the Magic Ring</I> by Eleanor Farjeon (with pictures by Susan Beatrice Pearse) -- My grandmother picked up this children's book at a thrift store many, many years ago, so it was old and very used when she gave it to me. It's about a little girl who longs to own a special doll from the local toy store but can't possibly afford it. Ameliaranne wins a toy ruby ring from a grab bag run by gypsies. Then she finds out that the old woman who runs the toyshop mistakenly gave her life savings away to the gypsies, who also deal in rags. Ameliaranne finds the daughter of the gypsies and trades her ruby ring for the old sock with the money. Grateful to have her life savings returned, the old woman gives Ameliaranne the doll as a reward. I loved this story! Then my sister lost it. Spring forward about thirty years. My sister did a search on the Internet, found a copy, and just gave it to me for my birthday. (It turns out that while there is an entire series of Ameliaranne books, only 2,000 copies were printed of <I>Ameliaranne and the Magic Ring</I>.) It's amazing how clearly I had remembered the story and even whole sections of text, but what really struck me was that in many ways I had modeled my life on Ameliaranne. Not only that, the title for my new novel bears a striking resemblance to this book. The subconscious works in mysterious ways. <p>    <li><I>The Saturdays</I> by Elizabeth Enright -- Here's another children's book -- actually the first in a series -- that I loved and that really inspired me. My mother also loved this book when she was a girl and she had recommended it to me. All the children in the family pool their allowances, which allows one child each Saturday to go out and have an adventure. I'm a big believer in adventures for kids and adults. <p>    <li><I>My Year of Meats</I> by Ruth Ozeki -- I had this book sitting on my nightstand for a couple of years before I finally picked it up. I don't know if it's truly one of my all-time favorites, but it has really stayed with me. I loved the way Ozeki was able to take a controversial topic like hormones in meat and turn it into a fabulous and deeply emotional story. <p>    <li><I>Eiger: Wall of Death</I> by Arthur Roth -- This is one of the first of the adventure-disaster books to be published and it's recently been re-released in a new edition. In it, the author recounts every ascent on Eiger. What I loved was that you just couldn't tell which expedition was going to make it to the summit and which was going to fail or end in death. So much has to do with the fickleness of nature combined with man's persistent belief that somehow he will be able to bend nature to his will. So foolhardy! But also so human. So obviously I also loved <I>Into Thin Air</I> and <I>Into the Wild</I>. To me there's something very compelling about what people will do in the worst circumstances. Will they rise to the occasion or fail miserably through some particular human weakness? Quite apart from all that, I think these books helped me focus on the characters of Lily and Snow Flower. They both live under such harsh and difficult conditions, yet again the question for me was who would persist and triumph and who would fail. <p>    <li><I>Chronicles: Volume 1</I> by Bob Dylan -- In many ways, Bob Dylan, as a songwriter, has been the greatest influence on my writing.  He knows how to tell a story in just a few minutes with gorgeous language, full emotion, and great pacing. I found that he was able to convey that same sense of storytelling in this first volume of his autobiography. He doesn't care too much about keeping things linear, which I think is brilliant and refreshing. Of course we're born, live, then die -- that's linear -- but within that, life doesn't necessarily follow in a straight line. I can't wait to see what he writes next. <p>    <li><I>The Interpreter of Maladies</I> by Jhumpa Lahiri -- I usually don't like short stories, but I loved these. In my own work I've been interested in dislocation and disruption, especially for Chinese and Chinese immigrants. Reading Lahiri, I saw, once again, that everyone in this country shares in the immigrant experience. Certain emotions and life experiences are universal: falling in love, the death of a marriage, worry over children, infidelity, a life unfulfilled. The only real differences we have are in the particulars. She writes beautifully about food too!   <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>The Gay Divorcee</I>, <I>Flying Down to Rio</I>, <I>Top Hat</I> -- any Fred and Ginger film, actually. He has such grace, but he's a bit funny looking. She's so light and luscious on her feet, but she has a sly way with him that I've always admired. The music, the dancing, the silly dialogue, the stock characters are all so wonderful. I've seen some of these films dozens of times, but I can watch them dozens more. They transport me out of everyday life. <p>    <li><I>Jules and Jim</I> -- My mother took me to see this film when I was a little kid. I didn't get everything that happened in it until later, but even as a child I seemed to understand the idea of a triangle and how harmful and hurtful it could be. Even after all these years, there are certain images that have stuck with me.<p>  <p>  <li><I>The Matrix</I> -- The first time I saw it I was blown away -- just like everyone else, I guess. I found it visually exciting. It's so rare that we ever get to witness something completely fresh, and <I>The Matrix</I> was just that. My favorite part was when Neo wins the last battle, and then pulls everything within himself in such a calm, settled, and centered way. It's such an interesting way of looking at energy in the universe.  <p>  <li><I>Aliens</I> -- This is my all-time favorite movie. I went through a long period of terrible insomnia, which happened to coincide with the release of <I>Aliens</I> on cable. I could flip from channel to channel in the middle of the night and watch my favorite parts over and over again. I have whole scenes memorized! One night my husband woke up and called from the bedroom, "That's it. I'm getting you knitting lessons!" He thought knitting would make me calm and I'd have something to show for it at the end of the day (or night). He didn't know that I would continue to watch <I>Aliens</I> and knit, too. Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is a true adventure heroine. I wish there were more female characters in books and film like her. And the movie has one of the great lines of all time: "Get away from her, you bitch!"     <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I listen to all types of music -- opera, hip hop, Mexican jarocho, norteno, and mariachi music, Indian tabla, South African township, soundtracks, everything, really. I love the Beach Boys, Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Bonnie Raitt, and lots of stuff from the sixties; on the other side of the spectrum, I think 50 Cent, Eminem, and Outkast are great. They all know how to tell stories through song, and they're funny too.  <p>    I often find that words are distracting when I'm writing, so my favorite CDs to work to are <I>Puccini without Words</I>, which has, obviously, Puccini's opera scores minus the words, the soundtrack to <I>Monsoon Wedding</I>, and Mitsuko Uchida playing Mozart sonatas. For my new book, I've been writing a lot to <I>Very Be Careful</I> -- the first CD by a local Los Angeles band called El Grizz. It starts with some music from a palleta (popiscle) cart and has a great homey feeling. <p>    Not to work to, but I do love Dylan. I realize his voice isn't as melodious as it could be, but I still think the guy's a genius. And while I would never listen to opera when I'm writing, I've learned a lot about storytelling through opera, specifically how to tell a story through the pure emotion of music. The language is gorgeous too. In fact, I'd have to say that music has probably been a greater influence on me as a writer than books.     <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  <I>In the Absence of Sun</I>, by Helie Lee. Helie's first book, <I>Still Life with Rice</I>, is a Korean counterpart to my book, <I>On Gold Mountain</I>. But the book I think would be fun to read in a book group is <I>In the Absence of Sun</I>. Helie once again is telling a family story. After her first book came out, she received a letter from her "lost" great-uncle back in North Korea. Her family had thought he was long dead. Helie and her very old grandmother went to China and then to the border with North Korea to try and get the uncle and his family out. It's a true-life story of courage, adventure, and family love. I've gotten to know Helie in recent years and I still can't believe that such a sweet little thing could be so brave and sometimes reckless. So often when I was reading the book, I thought, "Oh, Helie, don't do that!" She has tremendous personal courage, a wonderful ability to show what someone will do for the love of family, and a lovely way of telling a story -- all attributes that I admire tremendously.     <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I love to get certain types of coffee table books, especially those about old China. I love to open the pages and be transported to another place and time. I love looking at the details of the clothes and the scenery, but most important I love to look at the faces. I rarely give books as Christmas or birthday gifts. However, if there's a book I think someone will really love or has a particular resonance at a particular moment, then I'll order a copy online and send it as a little surprise. <p>    For example, a couple of years ago a friend had a bad rafting accident in Colorado. I sent her a copy of Lisa Michael's <I>Grand Ambition</I>, which is about the first husband and wife team to try to go down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. The mystery of their disappearance has captivated people's imagination for seventy-plus years. Or my stepmother is African-American and spends a lot of time in Africa. I got a copy of the English edition of <I>The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency</I> about two years before it came out here and gave it to Anne because I knew she'd enjoy it. Similarly, I was at a book show and was able to pick up two advance copies of <I>Ender's Shadow</I>, the sequel to <I>Ender's Game</I>. My sons were both fanatics for the first book and were ecstatic to have early copies of the sequel. Books are wonderful little treats to have arrive unexpectedly, and the Internet has made it much easier to find them and give them. <p>           <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I don't have any special rituals other than starting early so I don't get distracted by the day and drinking lots and lots of decaffeinated tea. On my desk I have photos of my sons, Chinese wind-up toys (a goose, a pecking chick, and a little blue bird), a pencil holder my youngest son made me, a clay duck my other son made me, a photo of a dim sum lunch I made that was really gorgeous (if I do say so myself), a dictionary of Chinese street language, and the notebooks I've used to keep notes on each book I've written. <p>    To my right, I have a set of shelves with all of the projects I'm currently working on: the boards I sit on, reports from the commission I sit on, two big writing projects, and two small writing projects. To my left is another shelf with folders and stacks that have to do with projects that have to be done pronto. To my right, on the floor, are two piles of notes, articles, and books for the new book I'm working on. I like to keep my desk relatively clean but I also like to be able to keep everything that I'm working on very handy, which means that there are stacks of papers everywhere!   <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  No one would ever describe me as an overnight success, although I have had a lot of successes.  My first article was published about 30 years ago. (Yikes! That's a very long time ago. See what I mean about not being an overnight success?) But as I said, I've had things happen along the way that in the moment I thought made me think I was a "success." One of my proudest moments was when I was asked to be a judge for the Miss Chinatown Pageant. I don't think this would have meant anything to anyone else, but it was a big deal to me. In my family, the Miss Chinatown Pageant was huge! This made me feel like I'd arrived but also that I'd finally been accepted in Chinatown. <p>    Another high point was when <I>Flower Net</I> was optioned to be a film. I found myself one day having lunch with the producer, Alan Ladd Jr. -- Alan Ladd's son, and I can tell you that if you ever meet him you're supposed to call him Laddie -- in the commissary at Paramount Studios. He had won the Academy Award for Best Picture the night before for <I>Braveheart</I>. Everyone was coming up and congratulating him. It was all very exciting. At one point he leaned across the table and asked, "Who do you see as David (the main character in my mystery series), Mel or Harrison?" Well, the film was never made, but on that one day I felt like I'd really made it. <p>    But I can honestly say I have never written with success in mind. Maybe I should have and I would be more of a household name today. I've tried to write from my heart and I've always started from the position of being a reader first. What I love about books is when I open the pages, fly to a different world, time or culture, and connect to the characters and by extension to the human condition. So when I sit down to write, what I hope is that readers will open the pages, enter my world, come on a journey with me, connect to my characters -- whether real or imagined -- and then think about their own lives. <p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be?</b><br>  I think Joy Nicholson, who wrote <I>The Tribes of Palos Verdes</I>, is a very interesting writer.  I'm very much looking forward to her new novel, <I>The Road to Esmerelda</I>. She's a big environmentalist, very political, and really knows how to tell a story. <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Write a thousand words a day, no matter what. That's only four typed pages, not much. At the end of the week, you will have 20 pages. At the end of the month, if you worked every day, you will have 80 pages.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>In nineteenth-century China, in a remote Hunan county, a girl named Lily, at the tender age of seven, is paired with a laotong, an &#8220;old same,&#8221; in an emotional match that will last a lifetime. The laotong, Snow Flower, introduces herself by sending Lily a silk fan on which she&#8217;s written a poem in nu shu, a unique language that Chinese women created in order to communicate in secret, away from the influence of men. As the years pass, Lily and Snow Flower send messages on the fan and compose stories on handkerchiefs, reaching out of isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. Together they endure the agony of footbinding and reflect upon their arranged marriages, their loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace in their friendship, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their relationship suddenly threatens to tear apart.<br><br><b>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan </b>is a captivating journey back to an era of Chinese history that is as deeply moving as it is sorrowful. Now in a deluxe paperback edition complete with an expanded Random House Reader&#8217;s Circle guide and an exclusive conversation between Lisa See and her mother, fellow writer Carolyn See, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel is, as the Seattle Times says, &#8220;a beautifully drawn portrait of female friendship and power.&#8221;
</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Janet Maslin</h3><p><i>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</i> is written with a stately but unremarkable prettiness; it is not a book that will make its mark for reasons of style. But Ms. See has worked enough joy, pain and dramatic weepiness ("Oh, how I wanted to dip a cloth into that water and wipe away the cares that played across my laotong's features") to give it a quiet staying power. It's liable to be read by women's groups and valued for its quaintness. ("All people cherish the hair on their moles, but Uncle Lu's were splendid.") But what will work best for this book is its own secret message: cultures vary, but old sames and same-olds don't change.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Judy Fong Bates</h3><p>The wonder of this book is that it takes readers to a place at once foreign and familiar -- foreign because of its time and setting, yet familiar because this landscape of love and sorrow is inhabited by us all. <i>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</i> is a triumph on every level, a beautiful, heartbreaking story.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>See's engrossing novel set in remote 19th-century China details  the deeply affecting story of lifelong, intimate friends  (laotong, or "old sames") Lily and Snow Flower, their  imprisonment by rigid codes of conduct for women and their  betrayal by pride and love. While granting immediacy to Lily's  voice, See (Flower Net) adroitly transmits historical background  in graceful prose. Her in-depth research into women's ceremonies  and duties in China's rural interior brings fascinating  revelations about arranged marriages, women's inferior status in  both their natal and married homes, and the Confucian proverbs  and myriad superstitions that informed daily life. Beginning  with a detailed and heartbreaking description of Lily and her  sisters' foot binding ("Only through pain will you have beauty.  Only through suffering will you have peace"), the story widens  to a vivid portrait of family and village life. Most impressive  is See's incorporation of nu shu, a secret written phonetic code  among women-here between Lily and Snow Flower-that dates back  1,000 years in the southwestern Hunan province ("My writing is  soaked with the tears of my heart,/ An invisible rebellion that  no man can see"). As both a suspenseful and poignant story and  an absorbing historical chronicle, this novel has bestseller  potential and should become a reading group favorite as well.  Agent, Sandra Dijkstra.

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Foot binding; nu shu, a secret language used exclusively by the  women of Hunan Province for 1000 years; and laotong, the  arranged friendship between little girls meant to last a  lifetime, provide the framework for See's (Dragon Bones)  riveting look at a little-known chapter in 19th-century Chinese  history. In 1903, 80-year-old Lily looks back on her life, which  was anchored by her laotong relationship with the beautiful Snow  Flower. As little girls, the two communicated in nu shu, writing  of their mutual devotion on a fan they passed between each other  over the years. Raised according to the traditional restrictions  of the times, they lived most of their lives confined to the  upstairs women's chamber in their homes, enduring the relentless  societal insistence that women are worthless except for their  value in producing sons. The laotong bonds of Lily and Snow  Flower endure through family tragedies, a typhoid-fever  epidemic, and the Taiping Rebellion of 1851-64, but it is a  misunderstood message in nu shu, the language that held them  together for decades, that ultimately tears them apart. See's  meticulous research and exquisite language deliver a story that  is haunting, powerful, and, at times, almost too painful to  bear. Highly recommended. [See Prepub Alert, LJ 3/1/05.]-Beth E.

</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p>Adult/High School-Lily at 80 reflects on her life, beginning  with her "daughter days" in 19th-century rural China.  Foot-binding was practiced by all but the poorest families, and  the graphic descriptions of it are not for the fainthearted. Yet  women had nu shu, their own secret language. At the instigation  of a matchmaker, Lily and Snow Flower, a girl from a larger town  and supposedly from a well-connected, wealthy family, become  laotong, bound together for life. Even after Lily learns that  Snow Flower is not from a better family, even when Lily marries  above her and Snow Flower beneath her, they remain close,  exchanging nu shu written on a fan. When war comes, Lily is  separated from her husband and children. She survives the winter  helped by Snow Flower's husband, a lowly butcher, until she is  reunited with her family. As the years pass, the women's  relationship changes; Lily grows more powerful in her community,  bitter, and harder, until at last she breaks her bond with Snow  Flower. They are not reunited until Lily tries to make the dying  Snow Flower's last days comfortable. Their friendship, and this  tale, illustrates the most profound of human emotions: love and  hate, self-absorption and devotion, pride and humility, to name  just a few. Even though the women's culture and upbringing may  be vastly different from readers' own, the life lessons are much  the same, and they will be remembered long after the details of  this fascinating story are forgotten.-Molly Connally, Chantilly  Regional Library, VA   Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A nuanced exploration of women's friendship and women's writing in a remote corner of Imperial China. At the end of her life, Lady Lily Lu, the 80-year-old matriarch of Tongkou village, sits down to write her final memoir-one that will be burned at her death. Using nu shu, a secret script designed and kept by women, Lily spends her final years recounting her training as a woman, her longing for love and the central friendship of her life. Born, in 1823, into an ordinary farming family, Lily might not have ended up as a wealthy matriarch. Her earliest memories are of running through the fields outside with her cousin Beautiful Moon in the last days before her foot-binding. But in childhood, Lily's middle-class fate changed dramatically when the local diviner suggested that her well-formed feet made her eligible for a high-status marriage and for a special ceremonial friendship with a laotong (sworn bosom friend). Accordingly, Lily became laotong with Snow Flower, a charming girl from an upper-class household. Together, the two begin a friendship and intimate nu shu correspondence that develops with them through years of house training, marriages, childbirths and changes in social status. See (Dragon Bones, 2003, etc.) is fascinated by imagining how women with constrained existences might have found solace-and poetry-within the unexpected, little known writing form that is nu shu. Occasionally, in the midst of notes about childbirth and marriages, Lily and Snow Flower wonder how to understand the value of their secret writing in relation to the men's "outside world." The question is left delicately open. As the Taiping Rebellion (1851-64) approaches the villages around them, threatening todisrupt the social order, Lily and Snow Flower's private intimacy changes, stretches and is strained. Taut and vibrant, the story offers a delicately painted view of a sequestered world and provides a richly textured account of how women might understand their own lives. A keenly imagined journey into the women's quarters.

1. Lily endures excruciating pain in order to have her feet bound. What reasons are given for this dangerous practice?<p>

2. Did See's descriptions of footbinding remind you of any Western traditions?<p>

3. If some men in 19th-century China knew about nu shu and �old same� friendships, why do you think they allowed these traditions to persist?<p>

4. Reflecting on her first few decades, Lily seems to think her friendship with Snow Flower brought her more good than harm. Do you agree?<p>

5. Lily's adherence to social customs can seem controversial to us today. Pick a scene where you would have acted differently. Why?<p>

6. Lily defies the wishes of her son in order to pair her grandson with Peony. Does she fully justify her behavior?<p>

7. Lily sometimes pulls us out of the present moment to reflect--as an old woman--on her youthful decisions. What does this device add to the story?<p>

8. How would you film these moments of reflection?<p>

9. If Lily is writing her story to Snow Flower in the afterworld, what do you think Snow Flower's response would or should be?<p>

10. Did you recognize any aspects of your own friendships in the bond between Lily and Snow Flower?<a name="PRF"></a><h3>Forewords &amp; Introductions</h3><P><p>1. 1. In your opinion, is Lily, who is the narrator, the heroine or the villain?&#160;What are her flaws and her strengths?<br><br>&#160;2. Do you think the concept of &#8220;old sames&#8221; exists today? Do you have&#160;an &#8220;old same,&#8221; or are you part of a sworn sisterhood? In what ways are&#160;those relationships similar or different from the ones in nineteenthcentury&#160;China?&#160;<br><br>3. Some men in nineteenth-century China apparently knew about <i>nu&#160;shu</i>, the secret women&#8217;s writing described in <b>Snow Flower</b>. Why do&#160;you think they tolerated such private communication?&#160;<br><br>4. Lily writes her story so that Snow Flower can read it in the afterworld.&#160;Do you think she tells her story in a convincing way so that&#160;Snow Flower can forgive and understand? Do you think Snow&#160;Flower would have told the story differently?&#160;<br><br>5. When Lily and Snow Flower are girls, they have one intimate&#8211;&#160;almost erotic&#8211;moment together. Do you think their relationship&#160;was sexual or, given the times, were they simply girls who saw this&#160;only as an innocent extension of their friendship?&#160;<br><br>6. Having a wife with bound feet was a status symbol for men, and,&#160;consequently, having bound feet increased a woman&#8217;s chances of&#160;marriage into a wealthier household. Women took great pride in&#160;their feet, which were considered not only beautiful but also their&#160;best and most important feature. As a child, would you have fought&#160;against having your feet bound, as Third Sister did, knowing you&#160;would be consigned to the life of a servant or a &#8220;littledaughter-inlaw&#8221;?&#160;As a mother, would you have chosen to bind your daughter&#8217;s&#160;feet?&#160;<br><br>7. The Chinese character for &#8220;mother love&#8221; consists of two parts: one&#160;meaning &#8220;pain,&#8221; the other meaning &#8220;love.&#8221; In your own experience,&#160;from the perspective of a mother or a daughter, is there an element&#160;of truth to this description of mother love?&#160;<br><br>8. The author sees <b>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan </b>as a novel about love&#160;and regret, but do you think there&#8217;s also an element of atonement in&#160;it as well?&#160;<br><br>9. In the story, we are told again and again that women are weak and&#160;worthless. But were they really? In what ways did Lily and Snow&#160;Flower show their strength and value?&#160;<br><br>10. The story takes place in the nineteenth century and seems very far removed&#160;from our lives&#8211;for instance, we don&#8217;t have our feet bound,&#160;and we&#8217;re free and mobile. Do you think we&#8217;re still bound up in other&#160;ways: by career, by family obligations, by conventions of feminine&#160;beauty, or even by events beyond our control (war, the economy, and&#160;natural disasters)?&#160;<br><br>11. Because of its phonetic nature, <i>nu shu </i>could easily be taken out of&#160;context and be misunderstood. Today, many of us communicate&#160;though e-mail or instant-messaging. Have you ever had an experience&#160;where one of your messages was misunderstood because of lack&#160;of context, facial or body gestures, and tone of voice? Or have you&#160;ever received a message that you misinterpreted and had your feelings&#160;hurt?&#160;<br><br>12. Madame Wang, the matchmaker, is a foot-bound woman and yet she&#160;does business with men. How is she different from the other women&#160;in the story? Do you think she is considered a woman of status or is&#160;she merely a necessary evil?&#160;</p>
<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P>Chapter 1<br><br>Milk Years<br><br>My name is Lily. I came into this world on the fifth day of the six month of the third year of Emperor Daoguang&#8217;s reign. Puwei, my home village, is in Yongming County, the county of Everlasting Brightness. Most people who live here are descended from the Yao ethnic tribe. From the storytellers who visited Puwei when I was a girl, I learned that the Yao first arrived in this area twelve hundred years ago during the Tang dynasty, but most families came a century later, when they fled the Mongol armies who invaded the north. Although the people of our region have never been rich, we have rarely been so poor that women had to work in the fields.<br><br>We were members of the Yi family line, one of the original Yao clans and the most common in the district. My father and uncle leased seven mou of land from a rich landowner who lived in the far west of the province. They cultivated that land with rice, cotton, taro, and kitchen crops. My family home was typical in the sense that it had two stories and faced south. A room upstairs was designated for women&#8217;s gathering and for unmarried girls to sleep. Rooms for each family unit and a special room for our animals flanked the downstairs main room, where baskets filled with eggs or oranges and strings of drying chilies hung from the central beam to keep them safe from mice, chickens, or a roaming pig. We had a table and stools against one wall. A hearth where Mama and Aunt did the cooking occupied a corner on the opposite wall. We did not have windows in our main room, so we kept open the door to the alley outside our house for light and air in the warm months. The rest of our rooms were small,our floor was hard-packed earth, and, as I said, our animals lived with us.<br><br>I&#8217;ve never thought much about whether I was happy or if I had fun as a child. I was a so-so girl who lived with a so-so family in a so-so village. I didn&#8217;t know that there might be another way to live, and I didn&#8217;t worry about it either. But I remember the day I began to notice and think about what was around me. I had just turned five and felt as though I had crossed a big threshold. I woke up before dawn with something like a tickle in my brain. That bit of irritation made me alert to everything I saw and experienced that day.<br><br>I lay between Elder Sister and Third Sister. I glanced across the room to my cousin&#8217;s bed. Beautiful Moon, who was my age, hadn&#8217;t woken up yet, so I stayed still, waiting for my sisters to stir. I faced Elder Sister, who was four years older than I. Although we slept in the same bed, I didn&#8217;t get to know her well until I had my feet bound and joined the women&#8217;s chamber myself. I was glad I wasn&#8217;t looking in Third Sister&#8217;s direction. I always told myself that since she was a year younger she was too insignificant to think about. I don&#8217;t think my sisters adored me either, but the indifference we showed one another was just a face we put on to mask our true desires. We each wanted Mama to notice us. We each vied for Baba&#8217;s attention. We each hoped we would spend time every day with Elder Brother, since as the first son he was the most precious person in our family. I did not feel that kind of jealousy with Beautiful Moon. We were good friends and happy that our lives would be linked together until we both married out.<br><br>The four of us looked very similar. We each had black hair that was cut short, we were very thin, and we were close in height. Otherwise, our distinguishing features were few. Elder Sister had a mole above her lip. Third Sister&#8217;s hair was always tied up in little tufts, because she did not like Mama to comb it. Beautiful Moon had a pretty round face, while my legs were sturdy from running and my arms strong from carrying my baby brother.<br><br>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; Mama called up the stairs to us.<br><br>That was enough to wake up the others and get us all out of bed. Elder Sister hurriedly got dressed and went downstairs. Beautiful Moon and I were slower, because we had to dress not only ourselves but Third Sister as well. Then together we went downstairs, where Aunt swept the floor, Uncle sang a morning song, Mama&#8212;with Second Brother swaddled on her back&#8212;poured the last of the water into the teapot to heat, and Elder Sister chopped scallions for the rice porridge we call congee. My sister gave me a tranquil look that I took to mean that she had already earned the approval of my family this morning and was safe for the rest of the day. I tucked away my resentment, not understanding that what I saw as her self-satisfaction was something closer to the cheerless resignation that would settle on my sister after she married out.<br><br>&#8220;Beautiful Moon! Lily! Come here! Come here!&#8221;<br><br>My aunt greeted us this way each and every morning. We ran to her. Aunt kissed Beautiful Moon and patted my bottom affectionately. Then Uncle swooped in, swept up Beautiful Moon in his arms, and kissed her. After he set her back down, he winked at me and pinched my cheek.<br><br>You know the old saying about beautiful people marrying beautiful people and talented people marrying talented people? That morning I concluded that Uncle and Aunt were two ugly people and therefore perfectly matched. Uncle, my father&#8217;s younger brother, had bowlegs, a bald head, and a full shiny face. Aunt was plump, and her teeth were like jagged stones protruding from a karst cave. Her bound feet were not very small, maybe fourteen centimeters long, twice the size of what mine eventually became. I&#8217;d heard wicked tongues in our village say that this was the reason Aunt&#8212;who was of healthy stock, with wide hips&#8212;could not carry a son to term. I&#8217;d never heard these kinds of reproaches in our home, not even from Uncle. To me, they had an ideal marriage; he was an affectionate rat and she was a dutiful ox. Every day they provided happiness around the hearth.<br><br>My mother had yet to acknowledge that I was in the room. This is how it had been for as long as I could remember, but on that day I perceived and felt her disregard. Melancholy sank into me, whisking away the joy I had just felt with Aunt and Uncle, stunning me with its power. Then, just as quickly, the feeling disappeared, because Elder Brother, who was six years older than I was, called me to help him with his morning chores. Having been born in the year of the horse, it is in my nature to love the outdoors, but even more important I got to have Elder Brother completely to myself. I knew I was lucky and that my sisters would hold this against me, but I didn&#8217;t care. When he talked to me or smiled at me I didn&#8217;t feel invisible.<br><br>We ran outside. Elder Brother hauled water up from the well and filled buckets for us to carry. We took them back to the house and set out again to gather firewood. We made a pile, then Elder Brother loaded my arms with the smaller sticks. He scooped up the rest and we headed home. When we got there, I handed the sticks to Mama, hoping for her praise. After all, it&#8217;s not so easy for a little girl to lug a bucket of water or carry firewood. But Mama didn&#8217;t say anything.<br><br>Even now, after all these years, it is difficult for me to think about Mama and what I realized on that day. I saw so clearly that I was inconsequential to her. I was a third child, a second worthless girl, too little to waste time on until it looked like I would survive my milk years. She looked at me the way all mothers look at their daughters&#8212;as a temporary visitor who was another mouth to feed and a body to dress until I went to my husband&#8217;s home. I was five, old enough to know I didn&#8217;t deserve her attention, but suddenly I craved it. I longed for her to look at me and talk to me the way she did with Elder Brother. But even in that moment of my first truly deep desire, I was smart enough to know that Mama wouldn&#8217;t want me to interrupt her during this busy time when so often she had scolded me for talking too loudly or had swatted at the air around me because I got in her way. Instead, I vowed to be like Elder Sister and help as quietly and carefully as I could.<br><br>Grandmother tottered into the room. Her face looked like a dried plum, and her back bent so far forward that she and I saw eye to eye.<br><br>&#8220;Help your grandmother,&#8221; Mama ordered. &#8220;See if she needs anything.&#8221;<br><br>Even though I had just made a promise to myself, I hesitated. Grandmother&#8217;s gums were sour and sticky in the mornings, and no one wanted to get near her. I sidled up to her, holding my breath, but she waved me away impatiently. I moved so quickly that I bumped into my father&#8212;the eleventh and most important person in our household.<br><br>He didn&#8217;t reprimand me or say anything to anyone else. As far as I knew, he wouldn&#8217;t speak until this day was behind him. He sat down and waited to be served. I watched Mama closely as she wordlessly poured his tea. I may have been afraid that she would notice me during her morning routine, but she was even more mindful in her dealings with my father. He rarely hit my mother and he never took a concubine, but her caution with him made us all heedful.<br><br>Aunt put bowls on the table and spooned out the congee, while Mama nursed the baby. After we ate, my father and my uncle set out for the fields, and my mother, aunt, grandmother, and older sister went upstairs to the women&#8217;s chamber. I wanted to go with Mama and the other women in our family, but I wasn&#8217;t old enough. To make matters worse, I now had to share Elder Brother with my baby brother and Third Sister when we went back outside.<br><br>I carried the baby on my back as we cut grass and foraged for roots for our pig. Third Sister followed us as best she could. She was a funny, ornery little thing. She acted spoiled, when the only ones who had a right to be spoiled were our brothers. She thought she was the most beloved in our family, although nothing showed her that this was true.<br><br>Once done with our chores, our little foursome explored the village, going up and down the alleys between the houses until we came across some other girls jumping rope. My brother stopped, took the baby, and let me jump too. Then we went home for lunch&#8212;something simple, rice and vegetable only. Afterward, Elder Brother left with the men, and the rest of us went upstairs. Mama nursed the baby again, then he and Third Sister took their afternoon naps. Even at that age I enjoyed being in the women&#8217;s chamber with my grandmother, aunt, sister, cousin, and especially my mother. Mama and Grandmother wove cloth, Beautiful Moon and I made balls of yarn, Aunt sat with brush and ink, carefully writing her secret characters, while Elder Sister waited for her four sworn sisters to arrive for an afternoon visit.<br><br>Soon enough we heard the sound of four pairs of lily feet come quietly up the stairs. Elder Sister greeted each girl with a hug, and the five of them clustered together in a corner. They didn&#8217;t like me intruding on their conversations, but I studied them nevertheless, knowing that I would be part of my own sworn sisterhood in another two years. The girls were all from Puwei, which meant that they could assemble often, and not just on special gathering days such as Catching Cool Breezes or the Birds Festival. The sisterhood had been formed when the girls turned seven. To cement the relationship, their fathers had each contributed twenty-five jin of rice, which was stored at our house. Later, when each girl married out, her portion of rice would be sold so her sworn sisters could buy gifts for her. The last bit of rice would be sold on the occasion of the last sworn sister&#8217;s marriage. That would mark the end of the sisterhood, since the girls would have all married out to distant villages, where they would be too busy with their children and obeying their mothers-in-law to have time for old friendships.<br><br>Even with her friends, Elder Sister did not attempt to grab attention. She sat placidly with the other girls as they embroidered and told funny stories. When their chatter and giggles grew loud, my mother sternly hushed them, and another new thought popped into my head: Mama never did that when my grandmother&#8217;s late-life sworn sisters came to visit. After her children were grown, my grandmother had been invited to join a new group of five sworn sisters in Puwei. Only two of them plus my grandmother, all widows, were still alive, and they visited at least once a week. They made each other laugh and together they shared bawdy jokes that we girls didn&#8217;t understand. On those occasions, Mama was too afraid of her mother-in-law to dare ask them to stop. Or maybe she was too busy.<br><br>Mama ran out of yarn and stood up to get more. For a moment she stayed very still, staring pensively at nothing. I had a nearly uncontrollable desire to run into her arms and scream, See me, see me, see me! But I didn&#8217;t. Mama&#8217;s feet had been badly bound by her mother. Instead of golden lilies, Mama had ugly stumps. Instead of swaying when she walked, she balanced herself on a cane. If she put the cane aside, her four limbs went akimbo as she tried to maintain her balance. Mama was too unsteady on her feet for anyone ever to hug or kiss her.<br><br>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it time for Beautiful Moon and Lily to go outside?&#8221; Aunt asked, cutting into my mother&#8217;s daydream. &#8220;They could help Elder Brother with his chores.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t need their help.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Aunt admitted, &#8220;but it&#8217;s a nice day&#8212;&#8221;<br><br><br><i></i>
