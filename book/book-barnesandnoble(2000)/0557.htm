Although the show has made her face recognizable, there�s another part of Kate the viewers haven�t seen�her heart. In I Just Want You to Know, Kate reveals a less familiar spiritual side. She is a grateful and faith-filled mother who only wants the best for her children and is willing to sacrifice to make that happen.<p> The book covers the three years her family lived in their Elizabethtown home, a period Kate considers one of the happiest of her life. It shows the parents of eight kids (all under the age of six) transitioning from the chaos of caring for infants to the structured days of a home filled with budding preschoolers. <p> During that time, the family underwent major changes: <p> &#8226;  From diaper changing to potty-training the sextuplets<br> &#8226;  From only traveling a few miles for a rare meal out to flying to Hawaii to renew their wedding vows<br> &#8226;  From Kate�s need for control, to learning how to be flexible<br> &#8226;  From watching a child who couldn�t spell, singing B-I-B-I-B (the Bible song), to their first child growing in her faith and praying to ask Jesus into her heart<br> &#8226;  From Kate�s first speaking engagement (she was afraid to fly) to her book tour<br> &#8226;  From a desire for a �normal� family life that didn�t include outside help, to a desire for a �normal� day without public attention.<br>

											I am astonished at all the bad reviews which are mostly written by people who have decided they do not like Kate Gosselin, though they do not know her, I thought the book was redundant of the events that occurred on the show, and a little boring because of that but by no means was it a bad book. I also do not know her, so I do not feel right in judging her. I do know if I were a mom with that many children and TLC offered me millions of dollars to film us going to the zoo and living life, I would jump on it. I do not feel that makes me a bad person, or would exploit my child. They do not do anything bad on the show, and the book was sweet, but a tad boring for me since I have seen all the episodes.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Multiple-Blessings/Kate-Gosselin/e/9780310289029/?pv=y">Multiple Blessings</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Kate Gosselin's &quot;I just want you to know&quot; is an enjoyable read, sometimes touching, someti<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Suzie_Queue">Suzie_Queue</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1386321_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780310318965_BK_2_1386321" href="#previewReview_1386321" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 15, 2010: 
											I really enjoyed reading this book.  Kate certainly has a flair for saying and writing interesting things in a way that is compelling.  I cried at a few points at her tenderness and knowing how much pain she has been through especially lately, especially reading about her lost 7th baby, which I did not know and was very sad to hear................................................................ .............................................................................................................. <p/>She is a remarkable woman, espeically in her ability to write about Jon without showing any bitterness and even being a bit self deprecating but by now we all know why her nerves often frazzle for given an impossible task she made possible by being so anal and organized and being a task master to keep a childman in line who we saw how out of control irresponsible he became when no one was controlling him. It is good to see she does see her flaws and is working to better herself and her kids life, and admirably so, and she needs many pats on the back, more so than she gives herself credit for, for she deserves more kudos................................................................ .............................................................................................................. My only dissappointment was in a few of the letters to a few of the kids, she sounded a bit petty and anal in noting something typical of a kid that age that they did, and like giving them a dig to read when they read this and they will one day, and be brought back to that one petty thing they did that was obviously still bothering her when she wrote that page.  I wish she had been able to not do that for it always bothered me in their show when they made fun almost in their complaints almost put downs of their kids foibles... and don't all kids that age have their moments, but we all a least are saved being labelled and reminded of it for all to see for the rest of our lives.  But hopefully the income from the exposure at least will make the kids life more fun as Kate does indeed seem to provide above and beyond for her kids and hopefully even when the cameras aren't rolling.  Bless you Kate and your kids, and we all pray for Jon that he grows up one day and is the man/father you need for your kids............................................................................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................................................................................ p.s.  And to those of you who wrote such vitriol towards this mother in your reviews, obviouly you were not reviewing the book unbiased, and you came to it with a prejudgement and hate for this woman and I feel sorry for you for that is a sick obsession to cyber stalk her like that, and she is such a better and bigger person than you all for all Jon did she still shows no hate in her words in this book to him, yet she did NOTHING TO ANY OF YOU, yet you attack her with such sick hate and worrisome mental instability.  Get yourselves healthy for as you can see Kate is doing well and will only do better by herself and her kids, and you all should put your efforts into making yours and if you have kids their lives good as she does hers and her kids, and not waste your time cyber hating this good mother and...</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>The 9.8 million viewers of TLC�s Jon and Kate Plus Eight recognize Kate as the perky and practical mom of eight who has come into their homes for over 100 episodes of her family�s hit reality show.

I got out of our Big Blue Bus and was reaching in  for one of the kids when a black dog ran over and started licking my  leg. Though he was obviously a fan of my leg, I wasn't a fan of the  dog. I looked around and saw his owner, an older lady.  <p>     "Excuse me, could you please put him on a leash?" I asked.  <p>     "You want me to do what?"  <p>     "Could you put him on a leash? I have to get my kids out of the  car and some of them are scared of dogs."  <p>     "I will not!" she said indignantly.  <p>     Another lady in a van parked nearby had watched the encounter.  "What did she say?" she asked the woman with the dog.  <p>     "She told me to put him on a leash, and I said I wouldn't."  <p>     At that point, Jon and I just tried to do the best we could. We got  all eight of the kids out of the bus and assembled in a line holding  hands, steering clear of the dog still panting at my ankles.  <p>     "They were just on TV," the van lady said to the dog lady.  <p>     Jon and I started to lead the kids away from the bus.  <p>     "Hey, were you just on TV?" the dog lady asked. Suddenly she  didn't have as much attitude.  <p>     "Yes," I said over my shoulder. I didn't want to look at her and her  salivating dog. I just kept walking.  <p>     We took off across the parking lot with the woman following us.  "I know who you are. I love that show!"  <p>     What do you do with that? I've had plenty of practice since that  first fan encounter, but practice doesn't always make it easier. Most  people are respectful. They know how to say, "Oh, how cute," and  move on. My biggest concern is getting my children safely to our  destination, but persistent fans want to keep the conversation going.  <p>     Some people think the show took away our privacy, and maybe  our right to it; but before the show even began folks would approach  us. They wanted to see the kids. Let's face it-they're cute! I get it  that people are naturally drawn to their sweet little faces. I understand  people's curiosity about a large family with sets of multiples  and the attention it attracts in a small town. But even then I longed  to be inconspicuous and do the things ordinary families did.  <p>     In those early days, people didn't approach us much; they would,  for the most part, just stand back and stare. If I had paid attention,  I would have seen them pointing and counting, but most of the time  I didn't even notice. I was usually so hyper-focused on making sure  the kids got safely to our destination that I didn't notice people's reactions  unless they made it impossible for me to ignore them-like  the lady with the dog. A lot of times I would say, "It's nice to meet  you, but I'm sorry, I have to get my kids in the car."  <p>     The persistent fans were often more concerned about what they  were getting out of me than having respect for my situation. That's  probably where my perceived bad attitude toward the public started.  Depending on the location, I tried to be cordial and kind, but I probably  didn't always respond very well. Frankly, it bothered me that  people wouldn't leave us alone. Sometimes they even wanted to touch  the kids. I got very good about quickly stepping in between them  before they could.  <p>     These types of encounters caused Jon and me to long for what  we called a "normal" family life. For us, normal meant being able to  travel outside of the house with just the ten of us-no chaperones.  Normal meant my kids could get out and play freely, instead of being  restrained in their strollers because we couldn't keep sixteen chubby  little legs from running in eight different directions. In my fantasies  about "normal," I craved a quiet life where my family and I could  go out in public without people staring, pointing, and counting my  kids. It was hard enough trying to be a mom of twins and sextuplets  without feeling like the world was watching everything I did.  <p>                             * * *  <p>  Safety is always a concern for parents of young children, but for Jon  and me, any usual concern had to be multiplied by eight. For example,  what if our house caught fire during the night? That was one  of my greatest fears. Physically, how would two adults get eight kids  out of a burning house? Every night before I went to sleep, I prayed  to God to keep us safe from a fire.  <p>     When the six were infants, the best plan Jon and I could come up  with was for me to get Cara and Mady. Jon would then pile the little  kids into one big blanket and throw it over his shoulder like Santa as  we all raced to the nearest exit. We knew that wasn't a perfect solution-the  babies would roll all over each other, maybe even break  a bone-but it was better than the alternative. We always kept a  comforter under the cribs just in case of an emergency.  <p>     But once we were in a new house and the little kids were no  longer infants, we had to come up with a new plan. Though they  could walk, you can't tell six two-year-olds, "Yeah, I know it's hot  and smoky, but go ahead and walk down the stairs." No, they'd be  terrified. We had to come up with contingencies for every possibility.  "What if the fire is at the bottom of the steps?" "What if one of  them runs back upstairs to grab a comfort item?" "What if they're  too scared to come to us when we call them?" Other families had fire  drills; Jon and I had fire interrogations.  <p>     Another thought that kept us awake at night was who would take  the kids if something happened to us. For many families, it's easy to  find an aunt, grandmother, or close friend to take in a child or two.  <p>     But eight kids?  <p>     It was important to Jon and me that the kids stayed together.  Who would be willing and capable of taking all of them? My brother  and sister-in-law offered, but they already had four kids of their own.  It would be too much to have twelve kids in one house. Their intentions  were admirable, and we were grateful for the offer. But twelve  kids would send even me over the edge.  <p>     We struggled to find a solution. Eventually, we named our friends  as the first choice to take the kids. We chose them because their kids  were older, and we felt it wouldn't be such a huge burden for them to  take all eight. I trusted that they would make family visits a priority  for our kids in the event that something happened to Jon and me.  <p>     House fires. Parents dying. Certainly those are extreme, unlikely  events, but they are still normal concerns for most families. What  wasn't normal was how complicated it was to address those concerns.  We could twist ourselves in knots over the right thing to do.  It was never easy. The decisions we had to make seemed harder than  those made by typical families, and I longed for the simplicity of an  ordinary-sized household. In my fantasies these people's lives seemed  much less complicated than mine.  <p>                             * * *  <p>  Ordinary parents cook pancakes, but most don't quadruple the recipe.  Ordinary families buy bread at the grocery store, but few of  them buy it by the flat (that's twelve loaves if you're counting). Ordinary  moms of two-year-olds run out of energy during the day,  but I'm guessing they don't usually feel entirely depleted. From the  mundane (we ate four boxes of cereal or two dozen eggs for breakfast  every day) to the unusual (on Christmas we put a baby gate around  our tree to protect the ornaments from the kids and the kids from  the ornaments) our normal was never ordinary.  <p>     Our culture just isn't set up for supersized families.  <p>     Take trash for example. No one ever thinks about their trash.  They collect it from their house once or twice a week, set it by the  curb, and forget it until the next week. Not us. We lived in an area  where there were strict limits on the number of bags you could throw  away each week, and we always exceeded those limits-especially  when the kids were in diapers. We easily had two bags of trash on  an ordinary day, more on birthdays and holidays. By the end of an  average week, we'd have four huge cans filled with bags of garbage  and diapers.  <p>     I remember so many Sundays nights when Jon would be in the  garage rationing out what garbage he could put out and what he  could hold back for the next week. It was like a game of schoolyard  trading where we always got the bad deal. "I'll trade one bag of dirty  diapers for two bags of kitchen refuse that maybe I can compress  down into a single bag to put out next week." But each week, the  same problem only got worse.  <p>     One solution was to call our neighbor and friend, Miss Beverly.  She came over weekly to fold our laundry and was always willing  to help us out. She and her husband never used all of their garbage  allotment, so Sunday nights Jon would wheel a trash can down a few  streets and up a hill to leave it at her house.  <p>     I know it seems crazy to worry about trash, but Jon and I spent  a lot of time in those days thinking about it. We would fantasize  about normal family-sized trash the way other people dream of white  picket fences.  <p>     During that time, we exceeded our trash quota so often that we  left presents on top of the trash cans in hopes the sanitation workers  would take everything we put out. Sometimes we left little snacks,  baked goods, or candy-anything we had.  <p>     But not every problem could be solved logistically; sometimes we  just had to make do. For example, some parents worry about their  kids watching too much TV; I worried that my kids couldn't see the  TV. We moved an old TV into the babies' room so they could watch  a movie before their nap. But because the TV was small, and the  perimeter of the room was filled with cribs, there wasn't a central  location that gave all of the kids a good view of the screen. Several  of the kids, Hannah, Leah, and Alexis, especially, couldn't see it too  well. But we had to make do. Again, this was an issue I was sure  normal families never faced-but it was another small thing that  added to the guilt I felt.  <p>     Trash logistics and six little faces trying to view a TV screen  aren't life-shattering issues. But in our family, the most ordinary  activities could feel extraordinary. That also meant that unexpected  events, like a sick kid, could feel downright harrowing.  <p>                             * * *  <p>  Sickness is serious business at our house. Colds and flu don't just  travel through our family; they take up residence in each and every  child. But sometimes it's not just the illness that brings us down. The  ancillary things like doctor's visits, prescription refills, and health  professionals who don't understand our needs further complicate  daily life.  <p>     Lots of families with kids have stories about how all the kids got  sick at once. As a nurse, that part isn't hard. I'm used to taking care  of multiple patients at the same time. For me, the hardest part is trying   to get each and every child to the doctor's office when (and only  when) they need to be seen.  <p>     In December 2006, five of the six had been coughing for nearly  a week. I'm not the kind of mom who runs her child to the doctor  for every little sniffle, but their coughs had gone on for a long time  and I was particularly worried about Leah. When I put her into her  high chair one day, I thought I heard her wheezing. I decided to listen  to her chest with my  stethoscope, and when  I did, I heard crackling  and more wheezing.  <p>     I called the doctor's  office and asked if Leah  could be seen that day.  <p>     "Well, we don't really  have any appointments  available today."  <p>     "Can you just fit me in  between appointments?"  <p>     "We don't usually do  it that way."  <p>     "I know," I said, "but  I'm a nurse and I've listened  to her chest and it doesn't sound good. I think she should be  seen by a doctor. I'll take whatever you've got; I just need my child  to get in today." Finally, the assistant gave me an appointment and I  hung up. Now I had to find a babysitter to stay with the rest of the  kids.  <p>     Most moms know how hard it is to be seen by a doctor at the last  minute. Imagine trying to coordinate the one appointment available  in your physician's schedule with the schedule of a babysitter to  watch your other seven kids. Taking them with me wasn't an option.  I called everyone I could think of and no one was available. As it  grew closer to the appointment time I only had one option left-call  Jon home from work early. I hated to do that unless it was a real  emergency.  <p>     Jon came home to stay with the kids, and I was a little late for  the appointment, but I was so glad I followed my instinct. My tiny  girl had pneumonia! Poor Leah! I was right to insist that she be seen.  Had I waited a day, who knows how sick she might have become?  The doctor had me start her on a nebulizer, and she prescribed an  antibiotic-Zithromax.  <p>     I picked up the prescription on the way home and gave her the  first dose shortly after we got back. Unfortunately, my poor baby  threw up fifteen minutes later. She was hysterical. I was afraid she  had thrown up the medicine and I wasn't sure whether or not to  give her another dose. She needed to be on it, but I didn't want her  to overdose, and it was too late to call the pediatrician by then. Day  one of the illness was anything but smooth.  <p>     The next morning Aaden seemed to be doing worse so I listened  to his lungs. They also sounded crackly. I called the pediatrician, but  before they would put me through to the nurse, the front office staff  wanted to know what I needed.  <p>     "Well, now Aaden's lungs sound crackly ... Yes, I had Leah in  there yesterday and her lungs sounded the same way ... She has  pneumonia. So I was wondering if the doctor could call in a prescription  of Zithromax for Aaden too? Okay, I'll talk to the nurse ..."  <p>     When the nurse called back, I repeated all of the information and  answered her questions too. But then the conversation got weird.  <p>     "The doctor would never do something like that!" she said  suddenly.  <p>     "Like what?" I asked.  <p>     "Call in a prescription for a patient she hasn't seen."  <p>     To get my kids the medical care they needed, I had to work hard  to convince the office staff that when one of my kids got sick, the  others did too. Finding a last-minute babysitter for seven so I could  take one sick child to the pediatrician was part of my job as a mom of  eight little kids. And repeatedly calling the doctor for appointments,  prescriptions, and refills had to be done no matter how much I annoyed  the office staff.  <p>     I was quickly learning that we weren't normal by the world's  standards, but I also found out that with enough persistence, we  could make things work. In the end, Aaden was seen by the pediatrician  and was also treated for pneumonia. I've learned to always trust  my mommy instincts.  <p>                             * * *  <p>  If I learned anything during our time in Elizabethtown, it was that  our dreams of "normal" as defined by an average-sized family weren't  possible. Our logistics and our way of doing things was never normal  and never would be, but we learned to stop comparing ourselves  to other families, and we redefined what normal meant to us.  <p>     Normal for us meant, in part, having mounds of trash and weeks  of illness; but it also meant having large group fun we could never  have had with a smaller family, like team sports and playing school.  <p>     Another difference in our family was that we put extra effort  into giving the kids special, individual opportunities. We knew they  didn't get much time alone, so being intentional about allowing  them space and attention was more important for us than for other  families.  <p>     Redefining normal helped us to accept that things for us would  be different, and whether it was good or bad depended on what we  made of each situation.  <p>     I think every family needs to understand what makes their household  work-even if it doesn't function quite like other families. During  our time in that house, we learned to make a new kind of ordinary,  a Gosselin normal that worked for Jon and me and for our kids.  We learned we could feel like a regular family when we went out and  made it home safely without any major logistical issues. (When that  happened Jon and I would high-five each other because we felt so,  well, normal.)  <p>     We stopped comparing ourselves to other families and set about  making our own path in the world. People still stared at us and  counted us when we went out. Our safety and health issues were still  magnified times eight. We still ate more boxes of cereal and more  eggs at breakfast than other families did. But we began to see all of  that as our normal.  <p>     Learning to redefine our expectations was a huge blessing because  it was during those years that our show really took off. By the  time we left Elizabethtown, we would once again have to redefine a  new normal, one that included even more stares and pointing, as well  as lights, cameras, and a whole lot of action.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>I Just Want You to Know</b> by <b>Kate Gosselin</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Katie Irene Gosselin.
