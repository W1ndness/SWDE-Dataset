In doing so, he has found another way to make us grin wildly at someone's refusal to succeed. In fact, he can be so comical that the laughter that Lipsyte elicits sometimes allows us to forget that he's one of our best documentarians of the crumbling myth of the American Dream.</p>

Grasping after odd jobs to support his wife and child, Milo is offered one last chance by his former employer&#58; he must reel in a potential donor&#8212;a major &#8220;ask&#8221;&#8212;who, mysteriously, has requested Milo&#8217;s involvement. But it turns out that the ask is Milo&#8217;s sinister college classmate Purdy Stuart. And the &#8220;give&#8221; won&#8217;t come cheap. Probing many themes&#8212; or, perhaps, anxieties&#8212;including work, war, sex, class, child rearing, romantic comedies, Benjamin Franklin, cooking shows on death row, and the eroticization of chicken wire, <I>The Ask </I>is a burst of genius by a young American master who has already demonstrated that the truly provocative and important fictions are often the funniest ones.<p>
</p><h3>The New York Times -

That's not to say <i>The Ask</i> isn't well hewn, funny or sophisticated, because in fact it's all three&#8230;Lipsyte is one of a handful of living American satirists&#8230;who can tell a traditional story while remaining foul-mouthed and dirty enough to occupy the literary vanguard. This stuff wouldn't play well at, say, meetings of the D.A.R.&#151;too bad in a way, because it might not hurt them to hear it. Lipsyte is not only a smooth sentence-maker, he's also a gifted critic of power.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p><p><B>SAM LIPSYTE </B>was born in 1968.

											This book is written totally from the point of view of Milo Burke, who is working in the office of development at a college in New York, which he jokingly calls Mediocre College at New York City. It consists entirely of Milo's internal thoughts and his interactions with the people in his life. <p/>At the beginning of the story, he gets fired for losing his cool and telling off a pampered and spoiled brat of a student whose parents donate large sums to the college. But, then he is called back on a temporary basis to work on developing a large donation from an old college friend of his who has insisted on working with him in order to agree to a large donation. He is told that he will get his job back if he succeeds. But, his old chum also has another job for Milo - to help him address a problem he has dealing with a son that he fathered many years ago, an Iraq war veteran who is lost both of his legs in the service.<p/>Whether or not you enjoy this book will depend on whether you find the writer's humor to be funny. It seemed to me to be the humor of a college age male, often sarcastic and sexist. I have no sympathy for the targets of the humor here, and being an older male who has never completely grown up, I enjoyed the book's tone and attitude.<p/>The book reminded me in its structure and tone of Joseph Heller's "Something Happened," which I read a long time ago and recall only slightly. <p/>It is not until the last quarter of the book that the following exchange occurs between Milo and his boss at work: "No, I mean, if I were the protagonist of a book or a movie, it would be hard to like me, to identify with me, right?" "I would never read a book like that, Milo. I can't think of anyone who would. There's no reason for it." Is this just supposed to make us feel stupid?</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>If you have conversations in your head, this book is for you<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1383066_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780374298913_BK_1_1383066" href="#previewReview_1383066" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 11, 2010: 
											Depressing, hilarious and cringe worthy at times, this off beat story of a fallen painter/failed major gifts fundraiser is fresh and at times painfully truthful.  The writing style is part ageing hipster meets Woody Allen. The characters are in some ways people you know, people you meet everyday and people you've been avoiding ever seeing again for years. Yet I liked it a lot.  There are quotable lines that are priceless.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</h3><p><p>Sam Lipsyte is a master of erudite, equal-opportunity loathing, a desolating humor populated by characters blighted by the world. <i>Home Land</i> -- his last novel -- was one of the funniest books of the last two decades. It was so raucously good, many will think that any follow-up is destined to fail. But <i>The Ask's</i> precarious position between total success and not living up to expectations is a result of Lipsyte's expanding vision -- from <i>Home Land's</i> small-scale intimacies to the end of the financial world as many have known it. The terrible massiveness of this vision has to be confused and strange and just as miserable as it is funny because the failure of Lipsyte's Western world is epic and unstoppable.</p><p><i>The Ask</i> features Milo Burke, a development officer for the arts program at a "mediocre" New York university. Burke's caustic wit fuels hilariously profane and misogynist office banter with his jaded co-worker Horace, but his self-hatred (he wished to be a painter, his unfaithful wife is "all touched out," he's got a 3-year-old son who thinks he's a "pansy") and class resentment (just one element in his cornucopia of socio-political rage) make him horrendous at his job. While his colleagues bring in gifts of "endowed chairs, editing suites, sculpture gardens," Burke offends the Jewish ancestry of his last "ask" and fails to get a meager collection of plasma TVs.</p><p>Milo is a glutton for punishment, and the book opens with one of the only moments where he actually reacts to being mistreated. Fired for snapping at the entitled art-student-daughter of that potential TV donor, he has been left without work, health insurance for his family, and purpose.When his former boss contacts him unexpectedly and offers him his job back on the condition of a particular ask, Milo jumps at the offer even though he hates the job. The target of the ask, Purdy Stuart, was a rich kid who Milo partied with in college but whose family wealth split their post-graduation paths, a frenemy "who had powers of cajolement, a gentle quasi-Christ-y authority." Purdy purports to want to donate to the university on behalf of his wife, but he admits to Milo that his giving is really about covering up the fact of his illegitimate son. Milo reacts to the moral dilemma that Purdy's proposition thrusts upon him by surfing the web, ruminating on "how sick and marvelous an age this was" where anyone could be "a Newton, a Diderot." &nbsp;</p><p>But no matter how Milo tries to ignore his problems, he can't escape his life. The bottom can drop out of any of Lipsyte's moments: "All was peachy and near utopic until I rose for a beer. At that moment the knowledge just disappeared, tilted out of my earhole." And then Milo begins to whir, riffing away, deeper, more lost: "I'd have to start again, or else concede my memory palace was a panic room. It would be good to exile some items and sensations, some people, even, but how to cull? I could not spare one hamburger or handjob."</p><p>From here, <i>The Ask </i>documents Milo's powerlessness in a world where money is the acknowledged measure of love, status, family, compassion, and art, even as the book's seams stretch taut and almost break. Instead of slowing the narrative to face some of the cultural volatilities <i>The Ask </i>sets in motion, Lipsyte gives us too much of Milo's navel-gazing. And so what should be an astonishing climax (a scene in which Milo expresses sincere love and worry for his son) is only a flash of bright light in the darkness of a looming alley as the book races toward closure.</p><p>These missteps in pacing are nearly erased by Lipsyte's genius and dexterity. <i>The Ask</i> is alive with lexical cartwheels, laced with the jittery eroticism of pornographic fantasies: "I had already begun to picture my cock in high quiver, sliding up the lubed swell of her chest. We were in a library of lacquered wood. Viola tones rose from a carved alcove. Baby oil beaded on rare folios." Lipsyte's imagination<i> </i>is profane in the best and worst of ways; the few times his rocket-fueled prose fails to be funny it reads like overly scripted slapstick or bad standup. There's more pain and dread than in his previous novels, but Lipsyte once again delivers whipsmart dialogue and slightly cartoonish protagonists, men and women whose inflated oddities act like blinking neon signs. All of his characters are catastrophes.</p><p>But what is most remarkable about <i>The Ask</i> is how Lipsyte has grown and enlarged his target. In doing so, he has found another way to make us grin wildly at someone's refusal to succeed. In fact, he can be so comical that the laughter that Lipsyte elicits sometimes allows us to forget that he's one of our best documentarians of the crumbling myth of the American Dream.</p><i>--Alex Lemon</i><p>Alex Lemon is the author of <i>Happy: A Memoir</i>&nbsp;and three poetry collections, most recently, <i>Fancy Beasts</i>.</p>
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><p>Milo Burke, a development officer at a third-tier university, has &#8220;not been developing&#8221;&#58; after a run-in with a well-connected undergrad, he finds himself among the burgeoning class of the newly unemployed. Grasping after odd jobs to support his wife and child, Milo is offered one last chance by his former employer&#58; he must reel in a potential donor&#8212;a major &#8220;ask&#8221;&#8212;who, mysteriously, has requested Milo&#8217;s involvement. But it turns out that the ask is Milo&#8217;s sinister college classmate Purdy Stuart. And the &#8220;give&#8221; won&#8217;t come cheap. Probing many themes&#8212; or, perhaps, anxieties&#8212;including work, war, sex, class, child rearing, romantic comedies, Benjamin Franklin, cooking shows on death row, and the eroticization of chicken wire, <I>The Ask </I>is a burst of genius by a young American master who has already demonstrated that the truly provocative and important fictions are often the funniest ones.<p>
</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Lydia Millet</h3><p>Sam Lipsyte's third novel, <i>The Ask,</i> is a dark and jaded beast&#151;the sort of book that, if it were an animal, would be a lumbering, hairy, cryptozoological ape-man with a near-crippling case of elephantiasis. That's not to say <i>The Ask</i> isn't well hewn, funny or sophisticated, because in fact it's all three&#8230;Lipsyte is one of a handful of living American satirists&#8230;who can tell a traditional story while remaining foul-mouthed and dirty enough to occupy the literary vanguard. This stuff wouldn't play well at, say, meetings of the D.A.R.&#151;too bad in a way, because it might not hurt them to hear it. Lipsyte is not only a smooth sentence-maker, he's also a gifted critic of power.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Michael Dirda</h3><p>Generally, novels make us turn the pages because we want to know what happens next. But with Sam Lipsyte's <i>The Ask,</i> we turn the pages because we want to know what's going to happen in the next sentence. Here rants become arias, and vulgarity sheer poetry. Lipsyte's masters aren't Messrs. Strunk and White; they're gallows-humored Celine, Hunter S. Thompson at his most gonzo, the great Stanley Elkin. Although <i>The Ask</i> is unquestionably funny, it's by no means essentially comic. Its theme, after all, is loss, often heartbreaking loss&#8230;In the end, the dazzle simply highlights the darkness and the despair.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Lipsyte&rsquo;s pitch-black comedy takes aim at marriage, work, parenting, abject failure (the author&rsquo;s signature soapbox) and a host of subjects you haven&rsquo;t figured out how to feel bad about yet. This latest slice of mucked-up life follows Milo Burke, a washed-up painter living in Astoria, Queens, with his wife and three-year-old son, as he&rsquo;s jerked in and out of employment at a mediocre university where Milo and his equally jaded cohorts solicit funding from the &ldquo;Asks,&rdquo; or those who financially support the art program. Milo&rsquo;s latest target is Purdy Stuart, a former classmate turned nouveau aristocrat to whom Milo quickly becomes indentured. Purdy, it turns out, needs Milo to deliver payments to Purdy&rsquo;s illegitimate son, a veteran of the Iraq War whose titanium legs are fodder for a disgruntlement that makes the chip on Milo&rsquo;s shoulder a mere speck of dust by comparison. Submission is the order of the day, but where Home Land had a working-class trajectory, this takes its tone of lucid lament to the devastated white-collar sector; in its merciless assault on the duel between privilege and expectation, it arrives at a rare articulation of empire in decline. (Mar.)
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Milo Burke is a trademark Lipsyte creation&mdash;a sad sack, sure, but a sweet guy, observant, acerbic, and very winning. A failed painter now working a dead-end job in the fund-raising department of a New York university, Milo is assigned to approach his charismatic and very wealthy college buddy, Purdy Stuart, for a big donation. Things aren't too serene on the domestic front either, and listeners can expect mordant musings on family and fatherhood, lust and the vapidity of office life, and a brutal sendup of academia. And the narration is a revelation&#58; Lipsyte is cool and relaxed and transitions smoothly between monologue and dialogue. There are no strained characterizations&mdash;just subtle shifts that indicate a change in speaker&mdash;and as Milo, Lipsyte sounds just right&mdash;sullen, searching, and prone to sentimentality and sarcasm. Smart, compulsive listening. A Farrar, Straus & Giroux hardcover (Reviews, Oct. 5). (Mar.)</p><h3>Booklist</h3><p>Lipsyte's third novel, a darkly humorous story of sons and fathers, is both his most realistic and convulsively hilarious to date . . . Lipsyte's razor-sharp eye filets dying America, throwing off brilliant riffs and exhilaratingly steep dives from frontal lobe to perineum, sauced with yummy dollops of white liberal guilt . . . Yet for all his wit, Lipsyte's narrator is not above it all but deeply, messily down in it: the casual miracles of parenthood, the deepening thrum of mortality, the grim perdurance of a shaky marriage, 'warm with that feeling of wanting a feeling that maybe had already fled.' Seriously funny, Lipsyte sits alongside such illustrious Daves as Gates, Eggers, and Foster Wallace on the self-conscious shelf, but with a heartfelt brilliance all his own. (starred review)
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Lipsyte's new novel, following his cult hit, Home Land, is narrated by another of the author's trademark middle-aged losers&#58; Milo Burke, a development officer at a mediocre college in New York City. Burke's assignment is to reel in Purdy Stuart, a fabulously wealthy tycoon who went to school with Burke 20 years ago. In development jargon, Purdy is "The Ask," and this is Burke's last chance to secure a major "Give" before the global financial system collapses. Lipsyte is a comedian with a rant for every facet of city life. As in Home Land, the recurring topics are failure in America and the failure of America. How did we become the bitches of the First World? The humor is a hipster mix of pop and high culture, but the incessant joking eventually overwhelms the story line. VERDICT A treasure trove of brilliant asides and one-liners, this never really comes together as a coherent novel. Still, Lipsyte's fans will be looking for it.&mdash;Edward B. St. John, Loyola Law Sch. Lib., Los Angeles
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Another savage, hilarious black comedy from Lipsyte (Home Land, 2004, etc.). Now in his early 40s, Milo Burke has given up his youthful dream of art-world stardom for a sad but steady gig as a development officer at a second-rate university in New York City. But then the spoiled daughter of a fat-cat donor demands a favor, he resists, and she-this young woman doesn't know much, but she does know the score-points out that he is "actually the bitch of this particular exchange." Milo's reply contains "nothing an arrogant, talentless, daddy-damaged waif wants to hear about herself," and he gets canned. To help make ends meet for his (possibly wayward) wife and young son, he takes odd jobs, including a brief and memorable stint as assistant deck-builder to a man whose cherished big idea is a show that features celebrity chefs cooking last meals for the condemned on Death Row. Then he gets a mysterious reprieve from a major potential donor-an "ask," in development parlance-who specifically requests that the university detail Milo to court him and his money. But what will it cost to get his old job back? Before long Milo finds himself serving as a queasy mix of factotum, bagman, client state and sounding board to his old college buddy Purdy Stuart, who assigns him the task of delivering hush money to Purdy's secret illegitimate son, a legless and spectacularly embittered Iraq War veteran. Once again, Lipsyte creates a main character whose lacerating, hyper-eloquent wit is directed both outward at the world-sardonic commentary on parenthood, class privilege, sexuality, the working world, education, ideas of Americanness and much more-and inward; Milo spares himself no degradation, noself-loathing, nothing. As it goes on one can't help noticing, beneath the fevered playfulness, a deeply earnest moral vision akin to that of Joseph Heller or Stanley Elkin. The author's most ambitious work yet-a brilliant and scabrously entertaining riff on contemporary America.

Our republic's whoremaster days were through.  Whither that frost-nerved, diamond-fanged hustler who'd  stormed Normandy, dick-smacked the Soviets, turned out such  firm emerging market flesh? Now our nation slumped in the corner  of the pool hall, some gummy coot with a pint of Mad Dog  and soggy yellow eyes, just another mark for the juvenile wolves.  <p>     "We're the bitches of the First World," said Horace, his own  eyes braziers of delight.  <p>     We all loved Horace, his clownish pronouncements. He was a  white kid from Armonk who had learned to speak and feel from  a half-dozen VHS tapes in his father's garage. Besides, here at our  desks with our turkey wraps, I did not disagree.  <p>     But I let him have it. It was my duty. We were in what they  call a university setting. A bastion of, et cetera. Little did I know  this was my last normal day at said bastion, that my old friend  Purdy was about to butt back into my world, mangle it. I just  figured this was what my worst teachers used to call a teachable  moment.  <p>     "Horace," I said. "That's a pretty sexist way to frame a discussion  of America's decline, don't you think? Not to mention  racist."  <p>     "I didn't mention anybody's race," said Horace.  <p>     "You didn't have to."  <p>     "P.C. robot."  <p>     "Fascist dupe."  <p>     "Did you get avocado on yours?"  <p>     "Fattening," I said.  <p>     "Don't worry, baby," said Horace. "I like big women."  <p>     "What about hairy ones?" I said, parted my shirt to air my  nipple fuzz. Horace let me be a cretin with him. You could call  him my infantilism provider, though you'd sound like an idiot.  Otherwise, I was ostensibly upstanding, a bald husband, a slab-bellied  father.  <p>     "Gentlemen," said our supervisor, Vargina, coming out from  her command nook. "Did you send off those emails about the  Belgian art exchange?"  <p>     Horace swiveled back to his monitor with the mock panic  of a sitcom serf. Vargina took scant notice of our talk, tolerated  foul banter for purposes of morale. But the fact remained, we had  forgotten the afternoon's assignment. The gods of task flow did  not easily forgive.  <p>     Where we worked was in the development office of a mediocre  university in New York City. It was an expensive and strangely  obscure institution, named for its syphilitic Whig founder, but  we often called it, with what we considered a certain panache, the  Mediocre University <i>at</i> New York City. By we, I mean Horace  and I. By often, I mean once.  <p>     Our group raised funds and materials for the university's arts  programs. People paid vast sums so their spawn could take hard  drugs in suitable company, draw from life on their laptops, do  radical things with video cameras and caulk. Still, the sums didn't  quite do the trick. Not in the cutthroat world of arts education.  Our job was to grovel for more money. We could always use more  video cameras, more caulk, or a dance studio, or a gala for more  groveling. The asks liked galas, openings, recitals, shows. They  liked dinner with a famous filmmaker for them to fawn over or  else dismiss as frivolous.  <p>     An ask could be a person, or what we wanted from that person.  If they gave it to us, that was a give. The asks knew little about  the student work they funded. Who could blame them? Some  of the art these brats produced wouldn't stand up to the dreck  my three-year-old demanded we tack to the kitchen wall. But I  was biased, and not just because I often loved my son. Thing was,  I'd been just like these wretches once. Now they stared through  me, as though I were merely some drone in their sight line, a  pathetic object momentarily obstructing their fabulous horizon.  They were right. That's exactly what I was.  <p>     A solitudinous roil, my bitterness. Horace, after all, was their  age. He had no health insurance, just hope. Our rainmaker,  Llewellyn, seemed born to this job, keen for any chance to tickle  the rectal bristles of the rich with his Tidewater tongue. He was  almost never in the office, instead sealing the deal on a Gulfstream  IV to Bucharest, or lying topside on a Corfu yacht, slathered  in bronzer.  <p>     Llewellyn delivered endowed chairs, editing suites, sculpture  gardens. My record was not so impressive. My last big ask, for  example, had failed to yield a few plasma TVs from the father of  a recent film graduate.  <p>     Mr. Ramadathan had mortgaged his electronics store so his  son could craft affecting screenplays about an emotionally distant,  workaholic immigrant's quest for the American dream. But  the father's giddiness had begun to wear off. The boy was unemployable.  Now Mr. Ramadathan was maybe not so eager to relinquish  his showroom models.  <p>     I'd made the hot, khaki-moistening hike past all the car dealerships  and muffler shops on Northern Boulevard in Queens,  stood in the sleek, dingy cool of the store. Mr. Ramadathan sat  near the register in a wicker chair. The plasmas were not on display.  Sold or hidden, I had no idea. Mr. Ramadathan stared at  me, at the sweat patches on my crotch. He pointed toward some  old video game consoles, a used floor fan, dregs of the dream.  <p>     "Please," he said, "take those. So that others may learn."  <p>     Unlike the time Llewellyn secured a Foley stage for the film  department, there was no celebration on the Mediocre patio.  No sour chardonnay got guzzled in my honor, nor did any lithe  director of communications flick her tongue in my ear, vow to  put me on the splash page of <i>Excellence</i>, the university's public  relations blog.  <p>     If not so ecstatic in her position as Llewellyn, Vargina seemed  happy enough, or at least adopted a mode of wise, unruffled  decency in the office. She'd been a crack baby, apparently due  to her mother being a crackhead, one of the early ones, the baking  soda vanguard. Vargina was a miracle, and that's maybe the  only time I have used the word sincerely. Her mother had named  her the word her name resembled. A sympathetic nurse added  the "r."  <p>     "Milo," she said now. "How is the Teitelbaum ask going?"  <p>     Vargina had enormous breasts I liked to picture flopping out  of a sheer burgundy bra. Sometimes they just burst out in slow  motion. Sometimes she scooped them out with her slender hands,  asked me to join her reading group.  <p>     "Making progress," I said. "Chipping away."  <p>     "Maybe you need a larger tool," said Vargina, appeared to  shudder slightly, perhaps worried her innocent metaphor would  be misconstrued as sexual. Her words, however, were not misconstrued  at all. I had already begun to picture my cock in high  quiver, sliding up the lubed swell of her chest. We were in a  library of lacquered wood. Viola tones rose from a carved alcove.  Baby oil beaded on rare folios.  <p>     "Well," said Vargina, tapped the plastic parapet of my cube  wall. "Just stick with it."  <p>     "Will do."  <p>     Truth was, the Teitelbaum ask was going nowhere. I was  barely hanging on here in development. I wasn't developing. I'd  done some good work at a non-profit a few years ago, but the  South Bronx Restoration Comedy Project never really took off.  The university snapped me up at a bargain rate. I'd become one  of those mistakes you sometimes find in an office, a not unpleasant  but mostly unproductive presence bobbing along on the  energy tides of others, a walking reminder of somebody's error  in judgment.  <p>     But today some karmic adjustment seemed due. Just as Vargina  slipped back behind the particleboard walls of her command  nook, a painting major we knew a bit too well around here charged  up to my desk, planted her bony fist on my Vorticist mouse pad.  McKenzie was one of those girls who didn't eat enough, so that  all one really noticed about her were the mole-specked rods of  her arms, the lurid jut of her skull. Students had no reason to  visit our office, but her father had paid for our crappy observatory  upstate. She was in here a lot, to preen, complain. I guess it beat  making her putrid art.  <p>     "Hello, McKenzie," I said.  <p>     "Hi, yeah, sorry, I can't remember your name."  <p>     "Milo."  <p>     "Sure, okay. Milo. Listen, Milo, we talked last week and you  promised I'd be able to take the Impressionism to Regressionism  seminar even though it was full."  <p>     "Excuse me?"  <p>     "Yeah, you know, you promised you'd talk to the painting  department and sort it all out. I mean, if I told my father-"         "Hold on."  <p>     "Hold on?"  <p>     "I made no such promise. We have nothing to do with academic  decisions, with curriculum or enrollment."  <p>     "Okay, maybe it was that guy," said McKenzie, pointing.  <p>     "Horace?" I said.  <p>     "Yeah, Whore-Ass," said McKenzie.  <p>     Horace wore a pained grin at his terminal.  <p>     "Horace hasn't been well," I told McKenzie. "Now, as I mentioned,  we have no jurisdiction over any of these issues, but maybe  we can all get together with painting and figure this out."  <p>     "Meaning what?"  <p>     "Meaning we can figure this out."  <p>     McKenzie stared. How could she know I myself had once  been a fraud, chockablock with self-regard, at an overpriced  institution just like this one, still had the debt to prove it? How  could she know she stared down at the wispy pate of a man who  once believed he was painting's savior, back in a decade that truly  needed one?  <p>     She spoke quietly now&#58; "Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but  you really are here to serve my needs. My father taught me that  the consumer is always right. I am the consumer. You are actually  the bitch of this particular exchange. But don't think I don't  respect that you are just a guy, like, doing your shitty job."  <p>     "Thank you," I said.  <p>     "But maybe you aren't cut out to work with artists."  <p>     I guess what set me off was her effort to be polite. I should  have just leaned on the painting department to make room on  the roster for her, ruin the semester for some pimple-seared hump  who shared his name with no stargazing facility. Nobody cared. I  would be doing my shitty job. It was a good shitty job. I'd done  it for a few years and it paid pretty well, enough to let Maura go  part-time since the baby. There was a quality family plan, plus a  quality theft plan, the paints and brushes I smuggled home for  those weekends I tried to put something on canvas again, until  the old agony would whelm me and I'd stop and briefly weep and  then begin to drink and watch Maura cruise up and down the  cable dial all night, never alighting on anything for more than a  moment, her thumb poised like a hairless and tiny yet impressively  predatory animal above the arrow button, Maura herself  bent on peeking into every corner of the national hallucination  before bedtime.  <p>     She liked reality shows the best, and then the shows that purported  to be about reality.  <p>     So, yes, I should have just surrendered, cinched the entitled  scion her little pouch of entitlements, put in my calls to the name  shufflers, done my duty.  <p>     I thought about that moment later on. Maybe I got extra-tuned  to the concept of bitchhood once I became Purdy's, though  I must confess I've always found such usage of the term for female  dogs distasteful. My mother was a second-wave feminist. I wasn't  comfortable saying "cunt" until I was twenty-three, at which  point, admittedly, I couldn't hold back for a time.  <p>     Or maybe it's just that I've always despised phrases like "that  fateful day," but as time went on I found it hard to deny that the  afternoon Horace launched his E Pluribus Pimpus oratory and  McKenzie tried to reify my servility and I pictured titboning  Vargina in a rare books room was pretty damn fateful. Or was it,  in fact, just another random day, and it was I who did the fool  thing, forced my hand?  <p>     What I said to McKenzie, there is no point repeating. It's  enough to report my words contained nothing an arrogant, talentless,  daddy-damaged waif wants to hear about herself. When  I was finished she did not speak. A thickish vein in her pale head  fl uttered. The blue thing seemed to veer and switch direction.  Then she took a few steps back and, still staring at me, phoned  her damager. What was done to me was done in hours. My outburst  was deemed hate speech, which called for immediate dismissal.  I could hardly argue with them. I think it probably was  hate speech. I really fucking hated that girl.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>The Ask</b> by <b>Sam Lipsyte</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Sam Lipsyte.
