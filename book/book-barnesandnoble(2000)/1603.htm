Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.<P>Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town &#151; and the family &#151; Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.<P>What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.<P>For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her ownstory. A regular contributor to MSNBC.com, she lives in New York and Long Island and is married to the writer John Taylor.<br>

											Wow what a story of a dysfunctional family. This is an entertaining book that you won't be able to put down. You will really enjoy it. I think this story is very typical of the baby boomer generation and the lives they lived. I am sure some children today live this story too. This is the true story of the author's life growing up with an alcoholic father, a weird mother and a brother and two sisters. This family is on the run all the time, it is unbelievable what these people do- wow. It is a great book that you will not want to put down.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>a must-read for all.<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1397177_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780743247535_BK_1_1397177" href="#previewReview_1397177" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 30, 2010: 
											This book was recommended to me by a friend, and once I started reading it I could not put it down.  The raw emotion and straight-forward writing style Walls conducts her life story in is both emotionally powerful and bittersweet.  With all of the problems she and her family encounter throughout her journey she still writes in a positive style that urges an underlying &quot;I can do anything&quot; message to her readers.  After reading this book I'd have to say that this truly is an American story; providing insight to the American Dream, and all that one faces--both good and bad--to get there.  This will be a book that I carry its message and contents with me for a long time to come.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a powerful and inspirational read.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/I-Am-Nujood-Age-10-and-Divorced/Nujood-Ali/e/9780307589675/?pv=y">I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Freedom-Writers-Diary/Erin-Gruwell/e/9780385494229/?pv=y">The Freedom Writers Diary</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Thousand-Splendid-Suns/Khaled-Hosseini/e/9781594483851/?pv=y">A Thousand Splendid Suns</a>. </p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35704320.JPG" alt="" height="148" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Jeannette Walls</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>Jeannette Barrett Walls</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>New York, New York and East Moriches, Long Island, New York</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>April 21, 1960</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Phoenix, Arizona</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A., Barnard College, 1984</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some interesting outtakes from our interview with Walls:</I><p>    <b>"When I sat down to write <I>The Glass Castle</I>, there was no doubt in my mind</b> that once the truth about me was out I would lose all my friends and my job. So far, the reaction has been the opposite. I'm just stunned. I think I've shortchanged people and their capacity for compassion. The whole experience has changed my outlook on the world. My brother and I are closer. My sister Lori and I have discussed things we'd never before talked about. I'm back in touch with people I knew in West Virginia whom I hadn't spoken to since I left. My mother wants to correct something in the book: She wants everyone to know that she's an excellent driver.<p>    <b>"When I was growing up, I always loved animals.</b> But it was a part of myself that I'd let go dormant as an adult. Writing <I>The Glass Castle</I>, I was reminded of how important animals had always been to me, and that love was reawakened. Not long ago, I rescued two racing greyhounds, Emma and Leopold, and I'm irrationally devoted to them.<p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the spring of 2005, Jeannette Walls took some time to tell us about some of her favorite books, authors, and interests.</i> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  <li><I>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</I> by Betty Smith. This book didn't really influence me as a writer, but it had a powerful effect on my view of the world and first made me realize how much of an emotional wallop -- and comfort -- a book could deliver. I read it when I was 11 or 12 and was stunned that a character created 50 years earlier seemed so similar to me. She loved her father even though he was a hopeless drunk, she lived in a rough neighborhood but found beauty in it, and she was determined to make something of her life. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li><I>The Grapes of Wrath</I> by John Steinbeck -- I read it when I was 12, and it hit me almost as hard as <I>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</I>. I loved the family's struggle and pride. <p>    <li><I>The End of the Affair</I> by Graham Greene -- The unflinching way Greene portrays the conflict between faith and cynicism, and love and hate, makes this the most brutally honest -- and tender -- book I've ever read. <p>    <li><I>Monkeys</I> by Susan Minot -- Nothing escapes the young narrator's attention, but the fact that she doesn't acknowledge the implications of what she observes gives the book its magical quality. The real story is in what's unspoken. <p>    <li><I>The Liars' Club</I> by Mary Karr -- The spunkiness of the narrator, the gorgeous language, and the acutely observed detail give the flashes of horror and absurdity their shocking power. <p>    <li><I>This Boy's Life</I> by Tobias Wolff -- His childhood wasn't particularly traumatic, but Wolfe evokes it with such beautiful precision and sly humor. In sentence after sentence, he finds the perfect words to convey the complicated emotions of a boy who wants to be both tough and loved. <p>    <li><I>Peter the Great</I> by Robert Massey -- I just adore a good biography, and this is probably my favorite. Massey is sympathetic but also clear-eyed in his understanding of Peter. It's a beautifully researched and written book about a remarkable man and his place in history. <p>    <li><I>Angela's Ashes</I> by Frank McCourt -- What makes the book so irresistible is how when McCourt's life becomes bleaker, he responds by becoming more humorous and poetic. <p>    <li>John Updike's Rabbit series: <I>Rabbit Run</I>, <I>Rabbit Redux</I>, <I>Rabbit Is Rich</I>, and <I>Rabbit at Rest</I> -- Updike makes the life of a car dealer in a small Pennsylvania town an remarkable epic. What I find so compelling about Rabbit is the way he loves himself and takes such joy in his daily existence. <p>    <li><I>Anywhere but Here</I> by Mona Simpson -- The complicated combination of love and contempt that the narrator feels towards her mother makes this one of the most moving accounts of a daughter-mother relationship I've read. <p>    <li><I>The Painted Bird</I> by Jerzy Kosinski -- Humanity at its most savage, narrated by a young boy who doesn't fully understand what's happening to him or why and only wants to survive. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>The Verdict</I> -- I love the message of redemption through the truth; the way an alcoholic, loser attorney takes on a hopeless case against a powerful institution as way of restoring meaning to his life. <p>    <li><I>Casablanca</I> -- Like Rick, I am, I'm afraid, a rank sentimentalist. I always get teary in the scene where the French Resistance drowns out the Nazis in song. <p>    <li><I>Sophie's Choice</I> -- I can never resist watching this movie, even though I know that by the end I'll feel like I've been punched in the stomach. Gut wrenching, tender, poetic, tragic. <p>    <li><I>The Pianist</I> -- What's so beautiful about it is the character's struggle to retain some dignity and humanity through his music while the world around him has descended into the horror of the Nazi invasion.<p>    <li><I>His Girl Friday</I> -- It's a silly movie, but also astonishingly clever, and the actors are enjoying themselves so much that they're irresistible. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I listen to music mostly in the evening. I've come to love what is called world music, like the Zimbabwean Oliver Mtukudzi and the Colombian singer Marta G�mez. I also love the Irish folk singer Mary Black. Other favorites include Chet Baker, Eva Cassidy, and Billie Holiday. My favorite classical piece is probably Bach's Suites for Unaccompanied Cello. But I don't listen to anything when I'm writing. I'm too easily distracted. If there's music, or any noise, I try to block it out. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  <I>Gilead</I> by Marilynne Robinson. I find books that have a moral and spiritual center, that speak to what is really important and lasting, hugely appealing. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  Books are my very favorite gift to give. If you give a book to someone and they really respond to it, you feel you've actually changed their life in some way. I recently gave my father-in-law both volumes of William Manchester's biography of Churchill -- and we had long, animated conversations about him and history and the psychology and greatness. If a book really moves me, I'll sometimes buy several copies for friends and give them out even if there's no occasion. I bought <I>The Lovely Bones</I> for four or five people. If someone's not much of a reader, I try to find a book that speaks to one of their passions. Whenever I'm reading a book I enjoy, I always develop a mental list of the people I want to share it with. I love it when people reciprocate; when they call me up and tell me they're reading a great book and can't wait for me to read it. That's how I heard about <I>Gilead</I>. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I write on a 19th-century oak table, in front of a window overlooking a wisteria-covered arbor. I don't think I have any rituals per se, so I'll describe my writing habits when I wrote <I>The Glass Castle</I>. I wrote it entirely on the weekends, getting to my desk by 7:30 or 8:00 a.m. and continuing until 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. I wrote the first draft in about six weeks -- but then I spent three or four years rewriting it. My husband, John Taylor, who is also a writer, observed all this approvingly and quoted John Fowles, who said that a book should be like a child: conceived in passion and reared with care. <p>    <b>What are you working on now?</b><br>  While I was working on <I>The Glass Castle</I>, I told myself I'd never write another book -- it was so emotionally grueling -- but already I find myself kicking around ideas. I haven't settled on any yet. <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I've been a journalist for almost 20 years and wrote one nonfiction book about the history of the tabloid press. But writing <I>The Glass Castle</I> was an entirely different experience. I was writing about myself and about intensely personal -- and potentially embarrassing -- experiences. Over the last 25 years, I wrote several versions of this memoir -- sometimes pounding out 220 pages in a single weekend -- but I always threw out the pages. Once I tried to fictionalize it, but that didn't work either. It took me this long to figure out how to tell the story.  <p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be?</b><br>  Barbara Robinette Moss. I don't know if she qualifies as being "new" because she has two memoirs out, but I just love her, both as a writer and, from what I can tell, as a human being. She's brave, funny, sensitive, compassionate, and she deserves wonderful things in life. <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Write about the world you know best. Even if it's fiction, drawing on your own intensely felt personal experiences will make a story more compelling. For years, I wanted to write to about the glamorous and high profile. It turns out that the most interesting thing I had to tell was not only familiar to me -- it was a part of me that I'd tried to hide. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Gossip columnist Jeanette Walls dishes the dirt on her own troubled youth in this remarkable story of survival against overwhelming odds. The child of charismatic vagabonds who left their offspring to raise themselves, Walls spent decades hiding an excruciating childhood filled with poverty and shocking neglect. But this is no pity party. What shines through on every page of this beautifully written family memoir is Walls's love for her deeply flawed parents and her recollection of occasionally wonderful times.</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.<P>Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town &#151; and the family &#151; Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.<P>What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.<P>For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her ownstory. A regular contributor to MSNBC.com, she lives in New York and Long Island and is married to the writer John Taylor.<br>
</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Francine Prose</h3><p><i>The Glass Castle</i> falls short of being art, but it's a very good memoir. At one point, describing her early literary tastes, Walls mentions that ''my favorite books all involved people dealing with hardships.'' And she has succeeded in doing what most writers set out to do -- to write the kind of book they themselves most want to read.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Freelance writer Walls doesn't pull her punches. She opens her  memoir by describing looking out the window of her taxi,  wondering if she's "overdressed for the evening" and spotting  her mother on the sidewalk, "rooting through a Dumpster."  Walls's parents-just two of the unforgettable characters in this  excellent, unusual book-were a matched pair of eccentrics, and  raising four children didn't conventionalize either of them. Her  father was a self-taught man, a would-be inventor who could stay  longer at a poker table than at most jobs and had "a little bit  of a drinking situation," as her mother put it. With a fantastic  storytelling knack, Walls describes her artist mom's great gift  for rationalizing. Apartment walls so thin they heard all their  neighbors? What a bonus-they'd "pick up a little Spanish without  even studying." Why feed their pets? They'd be helping them "by  not allowing them to become dependent." While Walls's father's  version of Christmas presents-walking each child into the  Arizona desert at night and letting each one claim a star-was  delightful, he wasn't so dear when he stole the kids'  hard-earned savings to go on a bender. The Walls children  learned to support themselves, eating out of trashcans at school  or painting their skin so the holes in their pants didn't show.  Buck-toothed Jeannette even tried making her own braces when she  heard what orthodontia cost. One by one, each child escaped to  New York City. Still, it wasn't long before their parents  appeared on their doorsteps. "Why not?" Mom said. "Being  homeless is an adventure." Agent, Jennifer Rudolph Walsh. (Apr.)

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>An account of growing up nomadic, starry-eyed, and dirt poor in the '60s and '70s, by gossip journalist Walls (Dish, 2000). From her first memory, of catching fire while boiling hotdogs by herself in the trailer park her family was passing through, to her last glimpse of her mother, picking through a New York City Dumpster, Walls's detached, direct, and unflinching account of her rags-to-riches life proves a troubling ride. Her parents, Rex Walls, from the poor mining town of Welch, West Virginia, and Rose Mary, a well-educated artist from Phoenix, love a good adventure and usually don't take into account the care of the children who keep arriving-Lori, Jeannette, Brian, and Maureen-leaving them largely to fend for themselves. For entrepreneur and drinker Rex, "Doing the skedaddle" means getting out of town fast, pursued by creditors. Rex is a dreamer, and someday his gold-digging tool (the Prospector), or, better, his ingenious ideas for energy-efficiency, will fund the building of his desert dream house, the Glass Castle. But moving from Las Vegas to San Francisco to Nevada and back to rock-bottom Welch provides a precarious existence for the kids-on-and-off schooling, living with exposed wiring and no heat or plumbing, having little or nothing to eat. Protesting their paranoia toward authority and their insistence on "true values" for their children ("What doesn't kill you will make you stronger," chirps Mom), these parents have some dubious nurturing practices, such as teaching the children to con and shoplift. The deprivations do sharpen the wits of the children-leading to the family's collective escape to New York City, where they all make good, even the parents, who are content tolive homeless. The author's tell-it-like-it-was memoir is moving because it's unsentimental; she neither demonizes nor idealizes her parents, and there remains an admirable libertarian quality about them, though it justifiably elicits the children's exasperation and disgust. Walls's journalistic bare-bones style makes for a chilling, wrenching, incredible testimony of childhood neglect. A pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps, thoroughly American story.

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P><center><b>Chapter 1&#58; A Woman on the Street</font></b></center><P>I was sitting in a taxi, wondering if I had overdressed for the evening, when I looked out the window and saw Mom rooting through a Dumpster. It was just after dark. A blustery March wind whipped the steam coming out of the manholes, and people hurried along the sidewalks with their collars turned up. I was stuck in traffic two blocks from the party where I was heading.<P>Mom stood fifteen feet away. She had tied rags around her shoulders to keep out the spring chill and was picking through the trash while her dog, a black-and-white terrier mix, played at her feet. Mom's gestures were all familiar &#151; the way she tilted her head and thrust out her lower lip when studying items of potential value that she'd hoisted out of the Dumpster, the way her eyes widened with childish glee when she found something she liked. Her long hair was streaked with gray, tangled and matted, and her eyes had sunk deep into their sockets, but still she reminded me of the mom she'd been when I was a kid, swan-diving off cliffs and painting in the desert and reading Shakespeare aloud. Her cheekbones were still high and strong, but the skin was parched and ruddy from all those winters and summers exposed to the elements. To the people walking by, she probably looked like any of the thousands of homeless people in New York City.<P>It had been months since I laid eyes on Mom, and when she looked up, I was overcome with panic that she'd see me and call out my name, and that someone on the way to the same party would spot us together and Mom would introduce herself and my secret would be out.<P>I slid down in the seat and asked the driverto turn around and take me home to Park Avenue.<P>The taxi pulled up in front of my building, the doorman held the door for me, and the elevator man took me up to my floor. My husband was working late, as he did most nights, and the apartment was silent except for the click of my heels on the polished wood floor. I was still rattled from seeing Mom, the unexpectedness of coming across her, the sight of her rooting happily through the Dumpster. I put some Vivaldi on, hoping the music would settle me down.<P>I looked around the room. There were the turn-of-the-century bronze-and-silver vases and the old books with worn leather spines that I'd collected at flea markets. There were the Georgian maps I'd had framed, the Persian rugs, and the overstuffed leather armchair I liked to sink into at the end of the day.

<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><b>A Woman on the Street</b><p>
I was sitting in a taxi, wondering if I had overdressed for the evening, when I looked out the window and saw Mom rooting through a Dumpster. It was just after dark. A blustery March wind whipped the steam coming out of the manholes, and people hurried along the sidewalks with their collars turned up. I was stuck in traffic two blocks from the party where I was heading. <p>
Mom stood fifteen feet away. She had tied rags around her shoulders to keep out the spring chill and was picking through the trash while her dog, a black-and-white terrier mix, played at her feet. Mom's gestures were all familiar -- the way she tilted her head and thrust out her lower lip when studying items of potential value that she'd hoisted out of the Dumpster, the way her eyes widened with childish glee when she found something she liked. Her long hair was streaked with gray, tangled and matted, and her eyes had sunk deep into their sockets, but still she reminded me of the mom she'd been when I was a kid, swan-diving off cliffs and painting in the desert and reading Shakespeare aloud. Her cheekbones were still high and strong, but the skin was parched and ruddy from all those winters and summers exposed to the elements. To the people walking by, she probably looked like any of the thousands of homeless people in New York City. <p>
It had been months since I laid eyes on Mom, and when she looked up, I was overcome with panic that she'd see me and call out my name, and that someone on the way to the same party would spot us together and Mom would introduce herself and my secret would be out. <p>
I slid down in the seat and asked the driver to turn around and take me home to Park Avenue. <p>
The taxi pulled up in front of my building, the doorman held the door for me, and the elevator man took me up to my floor. My husband was working late, as he did most nights, and the apartment was silent except for the click of my heels on the polished wood floor. I was still rattled from seeing Mom, the unexpectedness of coming across her, the sight of her rooting happily through the Dumpster. I put some Vivaldi on, hoping the music would settle me down. <p>
I looked around the room. There were the turn-of-the-century bronze-and-silver vases and the old books with worn leather spines that I'd collected at flea markets. There were the Georgian maps I'd had framed, the Persian rugs, and the overstuffed leather armchair I liked to sink into at the end of the day. I'd tried to make a home for myself here, tried to turn the apartment into the sort of place where the person I wanted to be would live. But I could never enjoy the room without worrying about Mom and Dad huddled on a sidewalk grate somewhere. I fretted about them, but I was embarrassed by them, too, and ashamed of myself for wearing pearls and living on Park Avenue while my parents were busy keeping warm and finding something to eat. <p>
What could I do? I'd tried to help them countless times, but Dad would insist they didn't need anything, and Mom would ask for something silly, like a perfume atomizer or a membership in a health club. They said that they were living the way they wanted to. <p>
After ducking down in the taxi so Mom wouldn't see me, I hated myself -- hated my antiques, my clothes, and my apartment. I had to do something, so I called a friend of Mom's and left a message. It was our system of staying in touch. It always took Mom a few days to get back to me, but when I heard from her, she sounded, as always, cheerful and casual, as though we'd had lunch the day before. I told her I wanted to see her and suggested she drop by the apartment, but she wanted to go to a restaurant. She loved eating out, so we agreed to meet for lunch at her favorite Chinese restaurant. <p>
Mom was sitting at a booth, studying the menu, when I arrived. She'd made an effort to fix herself up. She wore a bulky gray sweater with only a few light stains, and black leather men's shoes. She'd washed her face, but her neck and temples were still dark with grime. <p>
She waved enthusiastically when she saw me. "It's my baby girl!" she called out. I kissed her cheek. Mom had dumped all the plastic packets of soy sauce and duck sauce and hot-and-spicy mustard from the table into her purse. Now she emptied a wooden bowl of dried noodles into it as well. "A little snack for later on," she explained. <p>
We ordered. Mom chose the Seafood Delight. "You know how I love my seafood," she said. <p>
She started talking about Picasso. She'd seen a retrospective of his work and decided he was hugely overrated. All the cubist stuff was gimmicky, as far as she was concerned. He hadn't really done anything worthwhile after his Rose Period. <p>
"I'm worried about you," I said. "Tell me what I can do to help." <p>
Her smile faded. "What makes you think I need your help?" <p>
"I'm not rich," I said. "But I have some money. Tell me what it is you need." <p>
She thought for a moment. "I could use an electrolysis treatment." <p>
"Be serious." <p>
"I am serious. If a woman looks good, she feels good." <p>
"Come on, Mom." I felt my shoulders tightening up, the way they invariably did during these conversations. "I'm talking about something that could help you change your life, make it better." <p>
"You want to help me change my life?" Mom asked. "I'm fine. You're the one who needs help. Your values are all confused." <p>
"Mom, I saw you picking through trash in the East Village a few days ago." <p>
