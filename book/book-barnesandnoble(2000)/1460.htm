The Unseelie Court infuses me with its power. But at what price does such magic come? How much of my human side will I have to give up, and how much of the sinister side of faerie will I have to embrace? To sit on a throne that has ruled through bloodshed and violence for centuries, I might have to become that which I dread the most.<P>Enemies watch my every move. My cousin Cel strives to have me killed even now from his prison cell. But not all the assassination attempts are his. Some Unseelie nobles have waited centuries for my aunt Andais, Queen of Air and Darkness, to become weak enough that she might be toppled from her throne. Enemies unforeseen move against us&ndash;enemies who would murder the least among us.<P>The threat will drive us to allow human police into faerie for the first time in our history. I need my allies now more than ever, especially since fate will lead me into the arm of Mistral, Master of Storms, the queen&rsquo;s new captain of her guard. Our passion will reawaken powers long forgotten among the warriors of the sidhe. Pain and pleasure await me - and danger, as well, for some at that court seek only death.<P>I will find new joys with the butterfly-winged demi-fey. My guards and I will show all of faerie that violence and sex are as popular among the sidhe as they are among the lesser fey of our court. The Darkness will weep, and Frost will comfort him. The gentlest of my guards will find new strength and break my heart. Passions undreamed of await us - and my enemies gather, for the future of both courts of faerie begins to unravel.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Solving a double homicide, avoiding assassins and coping with  growing, sometimes uncontrollable, power keep faerie private  detective Princess Meredith NicEssus (aka Meredith Gentry) busy  in the fourth and strongest entry in Hamilton's adult fairy tale  series (after 2004's Seduced by Moonlight). When someone murders  a fey and a reporter during a press conference inside the  Unseelie's headquarters, Merry calls in the cops to assist (and  inadvertently involves the FBI as well). But once on magical  turf, human police face challenges and dangers of which the  princess was unaware. Meanwhile, Merry lives up to the five  fertility deities in her lineage and lustily fulfills her royal  duty of mating with sidhe males and making sex beyond mere human  comprehension. As Merry matures, the meaning of all the sex and  magic comes into more effective focus, as does Hamilton's  underlying mythos of the restoration of the faerie race's true  power. The absence of complicated politics results in a more  palatable plot than in previous volumes. By the end, the  Unseelie court seems to be tiring of Merry's super-sadistic Aunt  Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness (as are, most likely, many  readers). The queen's son and Merry's rival for the throne,  Prince Cel, looms as an even greater, more corrupt menace to her  future. Faeries, fornication and forensics fuse for yet another  darkly fantastic frolic for Hamilton fans. Agent, Merrilee  Heifetz at Writers House.

Since then vampires have been used as vehicles for everything from romantic novels to erotica to humor to the expected tales of terror. However, very few writers have combined all of these facets of the never-say-die vampire quite the way that Laurell K. Hamilton has.<p>    Hamilton has not always been under the spell of undead things that go bump-and-grind in the night. When she was a young girl, her literary tastes were a bit more on the traditional side. "I wanted to be Louisa May Alcott, who wrote <I>Little Women</I>, because I had never read any science fiction, fantasy, or horror," she confessed in a podcast on Mayor Slay.com. "Then at 13 or 14 I found Robert E. Howard's short story collection [<I>Pigeons From Hell</I>]. It was the first horror, the first heroic fantasy, the first science fiction I'd ever read, and the moment I read that I knew that not only did I want to be a writer, but this is what I wanted to write." <p>    Furthering Hamilton's burgeoning fascination with the fantastic, she discovered Anthony Masters's <I>The Natural History of the Vampire</I> at her high school library. Coupled with the ghost stories her grandmother had told her when she was a child and heavy doses of Hammer Horror movies from Great Britain, Hamilton was well on her way to creating a character that would only be rivaled by Buffy in the field of vampire slaying. <p>    Hamilton first introduced vampire huntress Anita Blake in her third novel <I>Guilty Pleasures</I>. Blake is an unlikely combination of action hero, federal marshal, "necromancer," and lusty dame. Her exploits between the sheets and in the graveyard won Hamilton a rabid following hungry for something new in the well-traveled vampire genre. <p>    Along with the kinds of scares normally associated with vampire stories, Hamilton's books are notable for their unflinching eroticism. Vampires have had a sexual lure since Stoker, but Hamilton particularly draws that aspect to the surface of her work as one of her creatures might draw blood from a victim. "I [want] a kiss to be so believable it gives the reader shivers," she says on her website. "Two things I do well are sex and violence, but I don't want gratuitous sex or violence. The sex and violence is only as graphic as need be. And never included unless it furthers the plot or character development." <p>    Another unlikely trait of her books is humor, vampire tales classically being of the more solemn sort. However, a writer weaned on a book titled <I>Pigeons From Hell</I> is not likely going to shy away from wit. Consequently, her books have been consistently entertaining and fun, as well as creepy and sexy. <p>    Hamilton has also brought her delicious combination of sex, humor, and frights to another series, this one more ingrained in dark fantasy than horror. Her faerie princess/P.I. Meredith Gentry made her debut in <I>Kiss of Shadows</I> in 2001 and has since sparked her own crowd-pleasing sword and sorcery meets pulp series. <p>    Increasingly, the Anita Blake and Merry Gentry books have added more sexual content to their story lines, classifying both series in a new hybrid genre that blends romance, erotica, and paranormal fantasy. To judge from Hamilton's consistent appearance on the bestseller charts, readers find the mix spellbinding.</P></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>One thing you will never find in a Hamilton novel is a cliffhanger.</b> She believes that cliffhangers unfairly tease readers who would then have to wait six months to a year to have some sense of resolution. As she said during an interview with Bill Thompson of <I>Eye On Books</I>, "Every book is a full meal. All the way from the appetizer to the dessert, so that you come away feeling that you've had an experience... and at the end you have that satisfied, full feeling."<p>    <b>Before Laurell K. Hamilton made a full-time career of blood, guts, murder, and mayhem,</b> she had more humane pursuits -- she volunteered at an animal shelter where she played with unwanted pets.   <p>    <I>In our interview, Hamilton shared some fun and fascinating facts about herself with us: </I><p>    <b>"I am incredibly stubborn.</b> Telling me I cannot do something, especially if you cite the fact that I am a girl, will make me want to do it more and do it better."<p>    <b>"I am not my characters.</b> We have some of the same traits in common, but we are very different people." <p>    <b>"Everything inspires me.</b> Getting up in the morning, walking the dogs, watching a music video. Inspiration comes from everywhere." <p>    <b>"I love animals.</b> I own four dogs, two of whom are rescues. In fact, Jimmy is with us because they were going to gas him if we didn't take him with us. As an older dog his chances of finding a home were fairly slim. But he has been a wonderful addition to our home."<p>    <b>"I like spending time with my family and friends.</b> Something I often feel I do not do enough of. But there are only so many hours in a day." <p>    <b>"I like to read other people's works.</b> I love reading cozy or historical mysteries when I can."<p>    <b>"I enjoy interacting with fans at planned public events.</b> I enjoy talking to them and have met many wonderful people." <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the winter of 2004, Laurell K. Hamilton took some time to talk with us about some of her favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  <I>Pigeons From Hell</I> by Robert E. Howard -- it was the first heroic fantasy/horror novel I ever read. I read it and knew that not only did I want to be a writer, but this was what I wanted to write. <p>    Andre Norton was important both for her science fiction and fantasy novels, and the fact that she was a woman. Before I became enamored of fantastic literature, my first writing hero was Louisa May Alcott, as in <I>Little Women</I>, and many more books. When I began writing horror and the like, I thought I'd left her far behind, only to discover that Ms. Alcott had also written gothic horror stories. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Charlotte's Web</I> by E. B. White -- E. B. White was one of the writers who taught me to be concise and descriptive at the same time. It is one of the great classics of American Literature. <p>    <li><I>101 Dalmatians</I> by Dodie Smith -- One summer, I read and reread this book 25 times. It left me with a lifelong love of the book -- and Dalmatians. <p>    <li> The Robert B. Parker Spenser novels -- Robert B. Parker was my introduction to good hardboiled detective fiction, and where I learned how good dialogue is done. Spenser books still remain a delight after all these years. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Bell, Book and Candle</I> -- This movie combines three of my favorite things: publishing, Halloween and Christmas. <p>    <li><I>Vampire Circus</I> (<I>Circus of Fear</I>) -- This is an old Hammer vampire film. This film probably influenced my writing more than even I know. I saw if for the first time at age seven and then again when I was in my twenties. The film stars a master vampire with long black hair and a frothy white shirt, a vampire who becomes a leopard, and more sexual innuendo than you can shake a stick at. Oh, and some not-so-sexual innuendo. It wasn't until after I started the Anita Blake series that I got to see it again. Talk about your subconscious absorbing something. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  Tori Amos is a perennial favorite, but I have listened to everything from Nine Inch Nails to The Veggie Tales Christmas album. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  Any Nero Wolf books by Rex Stout -- because we (my husband and I) started reading them a year ago. They are clever, charming and the quality of the writing is consistently high. They are a wonderful hybrid of hardboiled detective and super-genius detective. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>    I try to pick books that the recipient will actually read. I find most folks give books that they want to read or ones they hope will expand the mind of the recipient whether they like it or not. Books can do all that and still be entertaining. Books should be about the person you're giving it to rather than the gift giver. <p>    As to what kind of books I like to get, I tend to like animal books -- ones with lovely pictures of dogs or other animals. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I don't really have any rituals. And my desk needs to be an uncluttered space for me to work. So most likely I will have a cup of hot tea and the music I have chosen for this book. Much else and I tend to get distracted. <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  Nearly fourteen years ago when I was first trying to sell <I>Guilty Pleasures</I>, I had one publishing house reject the book on the grounds that the market couldn't bear another vampire book, and the week they were going to make the decision another vampire novel came out from another publisher. They used that as a reason to reject me, and Anita. They said that the vampire market was dying out, and no one wanted to read about vampires anymore. <p>    I was told by a prominent mystery editor that if my Anita Blake mysteries had been straight mystery, no horror elements, or fantastic elements at all, that I'd have never gotten published. Because I am a woman writing from a first person woman's point of view, that no one would have touched it. Maybe that's true. Maybe it was one of the things that sent Anita around to nearly every publisher before it found a home. I don't know. No one complained about the sexual content of the first book, but then, there wasn't any. <p>    I don't know if I'd have had more trouble if the first few books had had a higher content or not. I do know that by using the tropisms of several different genres, I get to play exactly the way I want to play. I get the tough as nails attitude of a hardboiled-mystery, the monsters and gore level of horror, the sex and sensuality of romance, the sheer wonderment of fantasy, and the feeling of reality that the best science fiction gives to amazingly odd facts. If I hadn't chosen to mix genres I might have had a harder time. Though most people told me that mixing genres this badly would doom me. Just goes to prove that you have to believe in yourself and your vision. <p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be?</b><br>  Rett MacPherson. The Victory O'Shea mysteries are delightfully different. First, the main character, Torie, is happily married, has more than one child and a mother who has been wheelchair bound most of Torie's life. The books are set around a small Missouri town that is a concentrated version of several historic towns here. Rett makes good use of Torie's extended family in the books and explains dramatic versions of some of the problems we all face with blood relatives. The series began in 1998 with <I>Family Skeletons</I> and is now in it's eighth book with the just-published <I>In Sheep's Clothing</I>. <p>    They are fun to read and I don't think enough people have found them yet. Rett is also a personal friend and member of my writing group.  <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Write. You'd be surprised how many wanna-be writers never seem to do that. Write, then finish it.  Finish the story. Finish the book. Do two pages a day, every day. Do not revise as you go. If you come to something you don't know, like what does 14th century underwear look like, put a note, skip it, and keep writing. I hear the wailing and gnashing of teeth, but trust me I've met too many writers that have the perfect three chapters of their book, but nothing more. Three chapters isn't a book, it's a beginning -- finish it. <p>    Once you have hundreds of pages on the other side of your computer, then go through and fill in those blank spots with research. Now, you can look up how to undress your 14th century heroine. Now you can chorography that fight scene. If you spend more than a week on a scene, maybe two days, skip it, write a note that says, fight scene here. You know who wins, just move on, keep going. The second draft is just filling in the blank notes. The third draft is where you begin to edit, and polish the writing. I did seven drafts of my first book, and I wrote it just like I've described. It sold. Most first novels don't. My way is not the only way, heaven knows, but it's the way that allowed me to write my first five to six books. <p>    I've gotten better at my job, and I no longer need seven drafts to get it where I want to be. But I find even today, as I write my seventeenth novel, that if I spend more than a week on a scene, I'm stuck, and I need to move on. Perfectionism has set in, and I'm trying to make it perfect. Perfection is an unattainable goal -- trust me on that. Just write, try not to worry, and when it's done, send it out. Try to sell it. For money. Not copies, not for friends to read. Sell it. This is a business, not a charity. Remember that. Your goal is to earn a living writing what you most love, right? Well, if that's your goal, act like it. <p>    I always started at the highest paying appropriate market for my short stories, and then worked down as they got rejected. I'm assuming that you have researched your markets and aren't trying to send vampire stories to magazines that don't even buy fiction. It's a business, remember. Sending your stories to inappropriate markets is like showing up for a job interview because you really want to edit fiction books, but you've walked into a computer-engineering firm. They don't edit fiction books there. Sending your story to the wrong market is the same deal. <p>    Here's another important piece of advice: send the story, or book out, then get started on the next one. Don't fret, and hover around the mailbox angsting over that one story. It's like a mother with one child -- you worry more. So have more literary children, that way when one is rejected you know that there are others out there, that haven't been. It takes some of the sting out of the rejection process. Not a lot, but some. You've got to want this more than any other job, and you've got to toughen your ego, so that the business doesn't crush you. Be tough. Believe in yourself and your dreams. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>The Barnes & Noble Review</b><br>In <i>A Stroke of Midnight,</i> Laurell K. Hamilton's fourth Meredith Gentry novel (<i>A Kiss of Shadows, A Caress of Twilight,</i> and <i>Seduced by Moonlight</i>), everyone's favorite private investigator -- and sexy faerie princess -- is back home in the treacherous Unseelie Court, trying to come to grips with her burgeoning supernatural powers.<p></p> 

After a barely thwarted assassination attempt, Princess Merry NicEssus (a.k.a. Los Angeles private eye Meredith Gentry) -- ignores the counsel of her aunt Andais, Queen of Air and Darkness, and decides to hold a press conference inside the fairy mounds: a dangerous move for all humans and sidhe involved. As the session is ending, two dead bodies are discovered -- one sidhe, one human. While police and FBI agents swarm the area, Merry's cadre of hunky sidhe guardians must not only track down the killer or killers and pacify the temperamental Queen; they also must find a way to impregnate Merry so that she can become the next Unseelie ruler. But as her sensual experiences begin to affect everyone around her in amazing ways, Merry realizes that with new powers come new responsibilities -- and new temptations. <p></p>

Although the overall Meredith Gentry story arc isn't advanced that much in <i>A Stroke of Midnight,</i> there are shocking revelations regarding the history of the Unseelie Court, as well as the jaw-dropping consequences of Merry's new powers. Saturated with suspense, mystery, and, of course, Hamilton's famously unbridled eroticism -- <i>A Stroke of Midnight</i> will leave Meredith Gentry fans both utterly satisfied and begging for more. <i>Paul Goat Allen</i></p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>I am Meredith Gentry, P.I., solving cases in Los Angeles, far from the peril and deception of my real home - because I am also Princess Meredith, heir to the darkest throne faerie has to offer. The Unseelie Court infuses me with its power. But at what price does such magic come? How much of my human side will I have to give up, and how much of the sinister side of faerie will I have to embrace? To sit on a throne that has ruled through bloodshed and violence for centuries, I might have to become that which I dread the most.<P>Enemies watch my every move. My cousin Cel strives to have me killed even now from his prison cell. But not all the assassination attempts are his. Some Unseelie nobles have waited centuries for my aunt Andais, Queen of Air and Darkness, to become weak enough that she might be toppled from her throne. Enemies unforeseen move against us&ndash;enemies who would murder the least among us.<P>The threat will drive us to allow human police into faerie for the first time in our history. I need my allies now more than ever, especially since fate will lead me into the arm of Mistral, Master of Storms, the queen&rsquo;s new captain of her guard. Our passion will reawaken powers long forgotten among the warriors of the sidhe. Pain and pleasure await me - and danger, as well, for some at that court seek only death.<P>I will find new joys with the butterfly-winged demi-fey. My guards and I will show all of faerie that violence and sex are as popular among the sidhe as they are among the lesser fey of our court. The Darkness will weep, and Frost will comfort him. The gentlest of my guards will find new strength and break my heart. Passions undreamed of await us - and my enemies gather, for the future of both courts of faerie begins to unravel.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Solving a double homicide, avoiding assassins and coping with  growing, sometimes uncontrollable, power keep faerie private  detective Princess Meredith NicEssus (aka Meredith Gentry) busy  in the fourth and strongest entry in Hamilton's adult fairy tale  series (after 2004's Seduced by Moonlight). When someone murders  a fey and a reporter during a press conference inside the  Unseelie's headquarters, Merry calls in the cops to assist (and  inadvertently involves the FBI as well). But once on magical  turf, human police face challenges and dangers of which the  princess was unaware. Meanwhile, Merry lives up to the five  fertility deities in her lineage and lustily fulfills her royal  duty of mating with sidhe males and making sex beyond mere human  comprehension. As Merry matures, the meaning of all the sex and  magic comes into more effective focus, as does Hamilton's  underlying mythos of the restoration of the faerie race's true  power. The absence of complicated politics results in a more  palatable plot than in previous volumes. By the end, the  Unseelie court seems to be tiring of Merry's super-sadistic Aunt  Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness (as are, most likely, many  readers). The queen's son and Merry's rival for the throne,  Prince Cel, looms as an even greater, more corrupt menace to her  future. Faeries, fornication and forensics fuse for yet another  darkly fantastic frolic for Hamilton fans. Agent, Merrilee  Heifetz at Writers House.

</div><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P>CHAPTER 1<br><br><br><br>I hate press conferences. but I especially hate them when I've been ordered to hide large portions of the truth. The order had come from the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the dark court of faerie. The Unseelie are not a power to be crossed, even if I was their very own faerie princess. I was Queen Andais's niece, but the family connection had never bought me much. I smiled at the nearly solid wall of reporters, fighting to keep my thoughts from showing on my face.<br><br>The queen had never allowed this much of the human media inside the Unseelie's hollow hill, our sithen. It was our refuge, and you don't let the press into your refuge. But yesterday's assassination attempt had made allowing the press into our home the lesser evil. The theory was that inside the sithen our magic would protect me much better than it had in the airport yesterday, where I'd nearly been shot.<br><br>Our court publicist, Madeline Phelps, pointed to the first reporter, and the questions began.<br><br>&quot;Princess Meredith, you had blood on your face yesterday, but today the only sign of injury is your arm in a sling. What were your injuries yesterday?&quot;<br><br>My left arm was in a green cloth sling that matched my suit jacket near perfectly. I was dressed in Christmas, Yule, red and green. Cheerful, and it was that time of year. My hair was a deeper red than my blouse. My hair is the most Unseelie part of me, sidhe scarlet hair for someone who looks good in black. Not the gold or orangey red of human hair. The jacket brought out the green in two out of the three circles of color in my iris. The gold circle would flash in the camera light sometimes as if it truly wasmetallic. The eyes were pure Seelie sidhe, the only part of me that showed that my mother had been of the golden court. Well, at least half.<br><br>I didn't recognize the reporter who had asked the question. He was a new face to me, maybe new since yesterday. Since yesterday's assassination attempt had happened in front of the media, on camera, well, we'd had to turn away some of the reporters, because the big room wouldn't hold more. I'd been doing press conferences since I was a child. This was the biggest one I'd had, including the one after my father was assassinated. I'd been taught to use names for reporters when I knew them, but to this one I could only smile and say, &quot;My arm is only sprained. I was very lucky yesterday.&quot;<br><br>Actually, my arm hadn't been injured in the assassination attempt that got on film. No, my arm had been hurt on the second, or was that the third, attempt on my life yesterday. But those attempts had happened inside the sithen, where I was supposed to be safe. The only reason the queen and my bodyguards thought I was safer here than outside in the human world was that we had arrested or killed the traitors behind the attempts on me, and the attempt on the queen. We'd damned near had a palace coup yesterday, and the media didn't have a hint of it. One of the old names for the fey is the hidden people. We've earned the name.<br><br>&quot;Princess Meredith, was it your blood on your face, yesterday?&quot; A woman this time, and I did know her name.<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; I said.<br><br>I smiled for real, as I watched her face fall when she realized she might be getting just a one-word answer. &quot;No, Sheila, it wasn't mine.&quot;<br><br>She smiled at me, all blond and taller than I would ever be. &quot;May I add to my question, Princess?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now, now,&quot; Madeline said, &quot;one question per.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's okay, Madeline,&quot; I said.<br><br>Our publicist turned to look at me, flipping off the switch at her waist so her microphone would not pick up. I took the cue and covered mine with my hand and moved to one side of it.<br><br>Madeline leaned in over the table. Her skirt was long enough that she was in no danger of flashing the reporters down below the dais. Her skirt was the absolute latest hem length of the moment, as was the color. Part of her job was paying attention to what was in and what was out. She was our human representative, much more than any ambassador that Washington had ever sent.<br><br>&quot;If Sheila gets to add to her question, then they will all do it. That will make everything harder, for you and for me.&quot;<br><br>She was right, but . . . &quot;Tell them that this is an exception. Then move on.&quot;<br><br>She raised perfectly plucked eyebrows at me, then said, &quot;Okay.&quot; She hit the switch on her mike as she turned and smiled at them. &quot;The princess will let Sheila ask another question, but after that you'll have to keep it to the original rule. One question per.&quot; She pointed to Sheila and gave a nod.<br><br>&quot;Thank you for letting me add on to my question, Princess Meredith.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You're welcome.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If it wasn't your blood yesterday, then whose was it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My guard Frost's.&quot;<br><br>The cameras flashed to life so that I was blinded, but the attention of everyone had moved behind me. My guards were lined up along the wall, spilling down the edges of the dais, to curl on either side of the table and floor. They were dressed in everything from designer suits to full-plate body armor to Goth club wear. The only thing that all the outfits had in common was weaponry. Yesterday we'd tried to be discreet about the weapons. A bulge that ruined the line of the jacket, but nothing overt. Today there were guns under jackets or cloaks, but there were also guns in plain sight, and swords, and knives, and axes, and shields. We'd also more than doubled the number of guards around me.<br><br>I glanced back at Frost. The queen had ordered me not to play favorites among the guard. She'd gone so far as to tell me not to give any long lingering glances to one guard over another. I'd thought it was an odd demand, but she was queen, and you argued with her at your peril. But I glanced back; after all, he'd saved my life. Didn't that earn him a glance? I could always justify it to the queen, my aunt, that the press would think it strange if I hadn't acknowledged him. It was the truth, but I looked because I wanted to look.<br><br>His hair was the silver of Christmas-tree tinsel, shiny and metallic. It fell to his ankles like decoration, but I knew that it was soft and alive, and felt oh so warm across my body. He'd put the upper layer of his hair back from his face with a barrette carved from bone. The hair glittered and moved around his charcoal-grey Armani suit that had been tailored over his broad shoulders and the athletic cut of the rest of him. The suit had also been tailored to hide a gun in a shoulder holster and a knife or two. It had not been designed to hide a gun under each arm, or a short sword at his hip, with a leather scabbard strapped tight to his thigh. The hilt of a second sword rode over his shoulder, peeking through all that shining hair. He bristled with knives, and Frost always had other weapons that you couldn't see. No suit was designed to cover that much armament and hold its shape. His jacket couldn't be buttoned at all, and the guns and sword and one knife glinted in the camera's flash.<br><br>Cries of &quot;Frost, Frost&quot; filled the room, while Madeline picked a question. The man was another one I didn't know. Nothing like an assassination attempt to attract the media.<br><br>&quot;Frost, how badly were you hurt?&quot;<br><br>Frost is a little over six feet, and since I was sitting down, and the microphone was adjusted to my height, he had to lean down, way down. With a weapon of any kind he was graceful. But bending low over that mike he was awkward. I had a moment to wonder if he'd ever been on mike before, then his deep voice was answering the question.<br><br>&quot;I am not hurt.&quot; He stood back up, and I could see the relief on his face. He turned away from the cameras, as if he thought he'd get off that easily. I knew better.<br><br>&quot;But wasn't it your blood on the princess?&quot;<br><br>His hand was gripping the pommel of his short sword. Touching his weapons unnecessarily was a sign of nerves. He leaned over the mike again, and this time he bumped my bad shoulder with his body. I doubted the press saw such a small movement, but it was too clumsy for words, for Frost. He braced a hand flat against the table, steadying himself. He turned eyes the grey of a winter sky to me. The look asked silently, &quot;Did I hurt you?&quot;<br><br>I mouthed, no.<br><br>He let out a sigh and leaned back to the microphone. &quot;Yes, it was my blood.&quot; He actually stood back up, as if that would satisfy them. He should have known better. He had been decorative muscle for the queen at enough of these over the years to know that he was being a little too concise. At least he didn't try to go back to his spot behind me this time.<br><br>A reporter I did know, Simon McCracken, was next. He'd covered the faerie courts for years. &quot;Frost, if you are not hurt, then where did your blood come from and how did it get on the princess?&quot; He knew how to word the question just right, so we couldn't tap-dance around it. The sidhe don't lie. We'll paint the truth red, purple, and green, and convince you that black is white, but we won't actually lie.<br><br>Frost leaned over the mike again, his hand pressed to the table. He'd moved minutely closer to me, close enough that his pants leg touched my skirt. His sword was almost trapped between our bodies. That would be bad if he had to draw the weapon. I looked at his hand, so big and strong on the table, and realized his fingertips were mottled. He was gripping the table the way you grip a podium when you're nervous.<br><br>&quot;I was shot.&quot; He had to clear his throat sharply to continue.

I realized he'd used my name without my title. A faux pas for a bodyguard, but of course, he was more than that. Every guard was technically in the running to be prince to my princess. But we were sidhe, and we don't marry until we're pregnant.

The order had come from the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the dark court of faerie. The Unseelie are not a power to be crossed, even if I was their very own faerie princess. I was Queen Andais's niece, but the family connection had never bought me much. I smiled at the nearly solid wall of reporters, fighting to keep my thoughts from showing on my face. <p> The queen had never allowed this much of the human media inside the Unseelie's hollow hill, our sithen. It was our refuge, and you don't let the press into your refuge. But yesterday's assassination attempt had made allowing the press into our home the lesser evil. The theory was that inside the sithen our magic would protect me much better than it had in the airport yesterday, where I'd nearly been shot. <p> Our court publicist, Madeline Phelps, pointed to the first reporter, and the questions began. <p> "Princess Meredith, you had blood on your face yesterday, but today the only sign of injury is your arm in a sling. What were your injuries yesterday?" <p> My left arm was in a green cloth sling that matched my suit jacket near perfectly. I was dressed in Christmas, Yule, red and green. Cheerful, and it was that time of year. My hair was a deeper red than my blouse. My hair is the most Unseelie part of me, sidhe scarlet hair for someone who looks good in black. Not the gold or orangey red of human hair. The jacket brought out the green in two out of the three circles of color in my iris. The gold circle would flash in the camera light sometimes as if it truly was metallic. The eyes were pure Seelie sidhe, the only part of me that showed that my mother had been of the golden court. Well, at least half. <p> I didn't recognize the reporter who had asked the question. He was a new face to me, maybe new since yesterday. Since yesterday's assassination attempt had happened in front of the media, on camera, well, we'd had to turn away some of the reporters, because the big room wouldn't hold more. I'd been doing press conferences since I was a child. This was the biggest one I'd had, including the one after my father was assassinated. I'd been taught to use names for reporters when I knew them, but to this one I could only smile and say, "My arm is only sprained. I was very lucky yesterday." <p> Actually, my arm hadn't been injured in the assassination attempt that got on film. No, my arm had been hurt on the second, or was that the third, attempt on my life yesterday. But those attempts had happened inside the sithen, where I was supposed to be safe. The only reason the queen and my bodyguards thought I was safer here than outside in the human world was that we had arrested or killed the traitors behind the attempts on me, and the attempt on the queen. We'd damned near had a palace coup yesterday, and the media didn't have a hint of it. One of the old names for the fey is the hidden people. We've earned the name. <p> "Princess Meredith, was it your blood on your face, yesterday?" A woman this time, and I did know her name. <p> "No," I said. <p> I smiled for real, as I watched her face fall when she realized she might be getting just a one-word answer. "No, Sheila, it wasn't mine." <p> She smiled at me, all blond and taller than I would ever be. "May I add to my question, Princess?" <p> "Now, now," Madeline said, "one question per." <p> "It's okay, Madeline," I said. <p> Our publicist turned to look at me, flipping off the switch at her waist so her microphone would not pick up. I took the cue and covered mine with my hand and moved to one side of it. <p> Madeline leaned in over the table. Her skirt was long enough that she was in no danger of flashing the reporters down below the dais. Her skirt was the absolute latest hem length of the moment, as was the color. Part of her job was paying attention to what was in and what was out. She was our human representative, much more than any ambassador that Washington had ever sent. <p> "If Sheila gets to add to her question, then they will all do it. That will make everything harder, for you and for me." <p> She was right, but ... "Tell them that this is an exception. Then move on." <p> She raised perfectly plucked eyebrows at me, then said, "Okay." She hit the switch on her mike as she turned and smiled at them. "The princess will let Sheila ask another question, but after that you'll have to keep it to the original rule. One question per." She pointed to Sheila and gave a nod. <p> "Thank you for letting me add on to my question, Princess Meredith." <p> "You're welcome." <p> "If it wasn't your blood yesterday, then whose was it?" <p> "My guard Frost's." <p> The cameras flashed to life so that I was blinded, but the attention of everyone had moved behind me. My guards were lined up along the wall, spilling down the edges of the dais, to curl on either side of the table and floor. They were dressed in everything from designer suits to full-plate body armor to Goth club wear. The only thing that all the outfits had in common was weaponry. Yesterday we'd tried to be discreet about the weapons. A bulge that ruined the line of the jacket, but nothing overt. Today there were guns under jackets or cloaks, but there were also guns in plain sight, and swords, and knives, and axes, and shields. We'd also more than doubled the number of guards around me. <p> I glanced back at Frost. The queen had ordered me not to play favorites among the guard. She'd gone so far as to tell me not to give any long lingering glances to one guard over another. I'd thought it was an odd demand, but she was queen, and you argued with her at your peril. But I glanced back; after all, he'd saved my life. Didn't that earn him a glance? I could always justify it to the queen, my aunt, that the press would think it strange if I hadn't acknowledged him. It was the truth, but I looked because I wanted to look. <p> His hair was the silver of Christmas-tree tinsel, shiny and metallic. It fell to his ankles like decoration, but I knew that it was soft and alive, and felt oh so warm across my body. He'd put the upper layer of his hair back from his face with a barrette carved from bone. The hair glittered and moved around his charcoal-grey Armani suit that had been tailored over his broad shoulders and the athletic cut of the rest of him. The suit had also been tailored to hide a gun in a shoulder holster and a knife or two. It had not been designed to hide a gun under each arm, or a short sword at his hip, with a leather scabbard strapped tight to his thigh. The hilt of a second sword rode over his shoulder, peeking through all that shining hair. He bristled with knives, and Frost always had other weapons that you couldn't see. No suit was designed to cover that much armament and hold its shape. His jacket couldn't be buttoned at all, and the guns and sword and one knife glinted in the camera's flash. <p> Cries of "Frost, Frost" filled the room, while Madeline picked a question. The man was another one I didn't know. Nothing like an assassination attempt to attract the media. <p> "Frost, how badly were you hurt?" <p> Frost is a little over six feet, and since I was sitting down, and the microphone was adjusted to my height, he had to lean down, way down. With a weapon of any kind he was graceful. But bending low over that mike he was awkward. I had a moment to wonder if he'd ever been on mike before, then his deep voice was answering the question. <p> "I am not hurt." He stood back up, and I could see the relief on his face. He turned away from the cameras, as if he thought he'd get off that easily. I knew better. <p> "But wasn't it your blood on the princess?" <p> His hand was gripping the pommel of his short sword. Touching his weapons unnecessarily was a sign of nerves. He leaned over the mike again, and this time he bumped my bad shoulder with his body. I doubted the press saw such a small movement, but it was too clumsy for words, for Frost. He braced a hand flat against the table, steadying himself. He turned eyes the grey of a winter sky to me. The look asked silently, "Did I hurt you?" <p> I mouthed, no. <p> He let out a sigh and leaned back to the microphone. "Yes, it was my blood." He actually stood back up, as if that would satisfy them. He should have known better. He had been decorative muscle for the queen at enough of these over the years to know that he was being a little too concise. At least he didn't try to go back to his spot behind me this time. <p> A reporter I did know, Simon McCracken, was next. He'd covered the faerie courts for years. "Frost, if you are not hurt, then where did your blood come from and how did it get on the princess?" He knew how to word the question just right, so we couldn't tap-dance around it. The sidhe don't lie. We'll paint the truth red, purple, and green, and convince you that black is white, but we won't actually lie. <p> Frost leaned over the mike again, his hand pressed to the table. He'd moved minutely closer to me, close enough that his pants leg touched my skirt. His sword was almost trapped between our bodies. That would be bad if he had to draw the weapon. I looked at his hand, so big and strong on the table, and realized his fingertips were mottled. He was gripping the table the way you grip a podium when you're nervous. <p> "I was shot." He had to clear his throat sharply to continue. I turned my head just enough to see that perfect profile, and realized it was more than nerves. Frost, the queen's Killing Frost, was afraid. Afraid of public speaking. Oh, my. "I have healed. My blood covered the princess when I shielded her from harm." <p> He started to stand back up, but I touched his arm. I covered the mike with my hand, and leaned in against him, so I could whisper against the curve of his ear.

And you need all the friendly you can get at a press conference. <p> "Frost, were you afraid?" <p> He relaxed minutely against me, into the touch of my hand and my face. "Yes," he said. <p> "Afraid to die," someone yelled out without being called on. <p> Frost answered the question anyway. "No." <p> Madeline called on someone, who asked, "Then what were you afraid of?" <p> "I was afraid Meredith would be harmed." He licked his lips, and tensed again.
