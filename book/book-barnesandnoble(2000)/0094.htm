Unabridged. 6 CDs.</p><h3>Annotation</h3><p>Around the narrative of Ruth McBride Jordan, a.k.a. Rachel Deborah Shilsky, the daughter of an angry, failed Orthodox Jewish rabbi in the South, her son James writes of the inner confusions he felt as a black child of a white mother and of the love and faith with which his mother surrounded their large family. The result is a powerful portrait of growing up, a meditation on race and identity, and a poignant, beautifully crafted hymn from a son to his mother.</p><h3>Salon - 
												James Marcus</h3><p>At a time when the relationship between African-Americans and Jews is deeply fissured, <i>The Color of Water</i> reminds us that the two groups have a long history of coexistence -- sometimes within a single person. The author's mother, Ruth Shilsky, was born in Poland in 1920, the daughter of an Orthodox Jewish rabbi. She grew up in rural Virginia, hemmed in by anti-Semitism and small-town claustrophobia, and at the age of 18 she fled to the cultural antipodes of Harlem. There, four years later, she married a black man named Dennis McBride, and since her family promptly disowned her, she launched a second existence as (to quote her son) "a flying compilation of competing interests and conflicts, a black woman in white skin." The lone Caucasian in her Brooklyn housing project, she somehow raised 12 children without ever quite admitting she was white. In retrospect, of course, her son is able to recognize that his parents "brought a curious blend of Jewish-European and African-American distrust and paranoia into our house." However, as children, James McBride and his 11 siblings didn't dwell on questions of their mother's color. Only later, after he became a professional journalist, did McBride feel compelled to tackle the riddle of his heritage. Bit by bit, he coaxed out his mother's story, and her voice -- stoic, funny, and with a matter-of-fact flintiness -- alternates perfectly with his own tale of biracial confusion and self-discovery.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>James McBride burst onto the scene with <I>The Color of Water,</I> a memoir exploring the author's struggle to understand his biracial identity.

											James McBride's story of coming to terms with the fact that his mother's skin might be white, but her soul was nonracial, is a timely read.  The characters are well delineated.  The story was told simply and honestly.  I felt like I knew the characters and liked most of them.  I would definately recommend this for a book club which is interested in dealing with issues which do not always have clear-cut solutions.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Read this book or listen to the CDs and you won't want to stop.<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Missive65">Missive65</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1389384_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781594481925_BK_2_1389384" href="#previewReview_1389384" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 17, 2010: 
											A cultural experience that takes you with the author/narrator on the different parts of his journey as well as his mother's. He takes us inside the American Black culture and is interspersed with finding out about his mother's Jewish culture and experiences. <p/>James McBride does a wonderful job of succinctly capturing facts, details and emotion, from the perspectives of while he was living each moment and with the benefit of hindsight.<p/>The words flow so easily and so well!  When I listened to the CDs, I found myself staying in the car till I could bare to stop.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Miracle-at-St-Anna/James-McBride/e/9781616802714/?pv=y">Miracle at St. Anna</a>. </p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>James McBride</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Bucks County, Pennsylvania</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>1957</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>New York, New York</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Oberlin Conservatory of Music; M.A., Columbia University School of Journalism</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>American Arts and Letters Richard Rodgers Award, 1996; ASCAP Richard Rodgers Horizons Award, 1996; Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Literary Excellence, 1997 and ALA Notable Book of the Year, 1997 for <I>The Color of Water</I></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>James McBride's bestselling memoir, <I>The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother,</I> explores the author's struggle to understand his biracial identity and the experience of his white, Jewish mother, who moved to Harlem, married a black man, and raised 12 children. Readers may not know that the multitalented McBride has another dual identity: He's trained as a musician and a writer and has been highly successful in both careers. <p>    After getting his master's degree in journalism from Columbia University at the age of 22, he began a career in journalism that would include stints as staff writer at the <I>Boston Globe</I>, <I>People</I> magazine, and <I>The Washington Post</I>. But McBride also loved writing and performing music, and at age 30, he quit his job as a feature writer at <I>The Washington Post</I> to pursue a music career in New York. After Anita Baker recorded a song he'd written, "Good Enough," McBride had enough contacts in the industry to spend the next eight years as a professional musician, writing, recording, and performing (he plays the saxophone). <p>    He was playing tenor sax for jazz singer Little Jimmy Scott while he wrote <I>The Color of Water</I> "on airplanes and in hotels." Like the jazz music McBride plays, the book alternates voices, trading off between McBride's perspective and that of his mother. <I>The Color of Water</I> was a worldwide success, selling millions of copies and drawing high praise from book critics. "This moving and unforgettable memoir needs to be read by people of all colors and faiths," wrote <I>Publishers Weekly</I>. It now appears on reading lists at high schools and colleges around the country.<p>    After the enormous success of <I>The Color of Water,</I> McBride felt some pressure to continue writing memoirs, or at least to continue with the theme of race relations in America. Instead, he turned to fiction, and although his second book draws part of its inspiration from family history, it isn't autobiographical. "My initial aim was to write a novel about a group of black soldiers who liberate a concentration camp in Eastern Europe," McBride explains on his web site. "I read lots of books and spent a lot of time researching the subject but soon came to the realization that I'm not qualified to write about the holocaust. It's too much." Instead, he recalled the war stories of his uncle and cousin, who served in the all-black 92nd Infantry Division, and began researching World War II in Italy -- particularly the clashes between Italian Partisans and the German army. <p>    The resulting novel, <I>Miracle at St. Anna,</I> is "an intricate mosaic of narratives that ultimately becomes about betrayal and the complex moral landscape of war" (<I>The New York Times Book Review</I>) and has earned high marks from critics for its nuanced portrayal of four Buffalo Soldiers and the Italian villagers they encounter. McBride, perhaps not surprisingly, likens writing fiction to playing jazz: "You are the soloist and the characters are the bandleaders, the Duke Ellingtons and Count Basies. They present the song, and you must play it as they determine."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>McBride has written songs</b> for Anita Baker, Grover Washington Jr., Gary Burton, and the PBS television character Barney. He has also written the score for several musicals and currently leads a 12-piece jazz/R&B band. <p>    <b>One of his most taxing assignments</b> as a journalist was to cover Michael Jackson's 1984 Victory Tour for six months. "I thought I was going to lose my mind," he told <I>USA Today</I>. <p>    <b>For a book fair, he performed</b> with the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock band made up of writers including Amy Tan, Mitch Albom, Stephen King, Dave Barry, and Ridley Pearson. <p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>As a young black boy in Brooklyn, James McBride wondered why his mother looked different. When he asked her if she was white or black, she would answer, "I'm light-skinned." Finally, when he had become an adult, she told him her story. She was a rabbi's daughter, born in Poland, raised in the American South. McBride's tribute, now published in a 10th anniversary edition, has become a classic in healthy race relations, a topic we are all apparently still learning.
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>This beautifully written <i>New York Times </i>bestseller has become a new American classic. <p>As a boy in Brooklyn&rsquo;s Red Hook projects, James McBride knew his mother was different. But when he asked about it, she&rsquo;d simply say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m light-skinned.&rdquo; Later he wondered if he was different too, and asked his mother if he was black or white. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a human being,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Educate yourself or you&rsquo;ll be a nobody!&rdquo; And when James asked what color God was, she said, &ldquo;God is the color of water.&rdquo; <p>As an adult, McBride finally persuaded his mother to tell her story&mdash;the story of a rabbi&rsquo;s daughter, born in Poland and raised in the South, who fled to Harlem after encountering anti-Semitism in her small town. Upon marrying a black man, her family promptly disowned her, causing her to launch a second existence as (to quote her son) &quot;a flying compilation of competing interests and conflicts, a black woman in white skin.&quot; <i>The Color of Water </i>is a poignant exploration of race, family, and identity, juxtaposing the author&rsquo;s experiences with his mother&rsquo;s stories.<p>James McBride is an author, musician and screenwriter. His landmark memoir, <i>The Color of Water</i>, is considered an American classic. His debut novel <i>Miracle at St. Anna </i>was translated into a film directed by icon Spike Lee. He has also written for the <i>Boston Globe, People</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Essence</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>National Geographic, </i>and the <i>New York Times</i>. James plays saxophone and tours with his six piece jazz/r&b band. He received the Stephen Sondheim Award and the Richard Rodgers Foundation Horizon Award for his musical &quot;Bo-Bos&quot; co-written with playwright Ed Shockley. A native New Yorker, he studied composition at The Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio and received his Masters in Journalism from Columbia University in New York at age 22. He holds several honorary doctorates and is currently a Distinguished Writer in Residence at New York University. He is married with three children.<p></p><h3>Salon - 
								James Marcus</h3><p>At a time when the relationship between African-Americans and Jews is deeply fissured, <i>The Color of Water</i> reminds us that the two groups have a long history of coexistence -- sometimes within a single person. The author's mother, Ruth Shilsky, was born in Poland in 1920, the daughter of an Orthodox Jewish rabbi. She grew up in rural Virginia, hemmed in by anti-Semitism and small-town claustrophobia, and at the age of 18 she fled to the cultural antipodes of Harlem. There, four years later, she married a black man named Dennis McBride, and since her family promptly disowned her, she launched a second existence as (to quote her son) "a flying compilation of competing interests and conflicts, a black woman in white skin." The lone Caucasian in her Brooklyn housing project, she somehow raised 12 children without ever quite admitting she was white. In retrospect, of course, her son is able to recognize that his parents "brought a curious blend of Jewish-European and African-American distrust and paranoia into our house." However, as children, James McBride and his 11 siblings didn't dwell on questions of their mother's color. Only later, after he became a professional journalist, did McBride feel compelled to tackle the riddle of his heritage. Bit by bit, he coaxed out his mother's story, and her voice -- stoic, funny, and with a matter-of-fact flintiness -- alternates perfectly with his own tale of biracial confusion and self-discovery.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The need to clarify his racial identity prompted the author to penetrate his veiled and troubled family history. Ruth McBride Jordan concealed her former life as Rachel Deborah Shilsky, the daughter of an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, from her children. Her grim upbringing in an abusive environment is left behind when she moves to Harlem, marries a black man, converts to Christianity, and cofounds a Baptist congregation with her husband. The courage and tenacity shown by this twice-widowed mother who manages to raise 12 children, all of whom go on to successful careers, are remarkable. Highly recommended for public libraries.-Linda Bredengerd, Univ. of Pittsburgh Lib., Bradford, Pa.

</div><a name="ITV"></a><h3>Interviews &amp; Essays</h3><P>November 13, 1997, renowned journalist James McBride joined BarnesandNoble@aol to discuss his memoir, THE COLOR OF WATER, which explores his white mother&#39;s Orthodox Jewish past as well as his own heritage as a man between black and white. <br><hr><b>VogelBN: </b>Good evening, Mr. McBride, and welcome to BarnesandNoble@aol! We&#39;re thrilled that you could join us!! We&#39;re brimming with wonderful questions from the audience, so whenever you&#39;re ready.... <p><b>James  McBride: </b>Delighted to be here! <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Mr. McBride, what an honor! I am leading a book club tomorrow on your book and am anxious to find out why you decided to share all this info with all the rest of us? <p><b>James  McBride: </b>Well, I always wondered where my mother came from. It was something that was on my mind for many, many years. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Judaism is passed down via the mother. Have you ever considered embracing the faith? Why or why not? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I&#39;ve considered it, but Christianity always worked for me. I grew up as a Christian. If my children decided to embrace the faith, I&#39;d be more than delighted. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>As I read THE COLOR OF WATER, I kept wondering, what was your mother&#39;s motivation to become a Christian? Do you think it was an effort to become closer to your father? Or did she have a revelation of faith? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> No. It happened because after her mother died, she converted to Christianity. I think that it was the loss of her mother and the loss of her family and the love of my father and the embrace of the Christian church that pushed her into Christianity. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Did you enjoy doing the "Rosie O&#39;Donnell Show"? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I did indeed. I kissed her seven times. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>What advice do you give to a novice like myself about entering the professional writing field? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> Well, writing teaches writing. Many books have been written between 5 and 7 in the morning. Never give up. It&#39;s a great catharsis. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Did you ever harbor any anger against your mother for her dishonesty? It seems that her secret was important to her sense of self, and thus valid, but still.... <p><b>James  McBride: </b> A very good question. I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve thought about that a lot. I&#39;m not sure if there was any other thing she could do. We didn&#39;t really have the time to think about her past that much. So it wasn&#39;t that great an issue. I was never angry at her for that. I think a lot of my anger was self-directed, meaning it had to do with my own feelings of inadequacy. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>What would you say to your mother&#39;s father if you met him today? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I have no bitterness toward him. I&#39;m sorry that he was the dysfunctional person that he was, but I certainly don&#39;t harbor any bitterness toward him. I guess I would say hello. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>How did finding out about your mother&#39;s history influence your own sense of identity? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> It gave me a tremendous sense of self. It made me feel complete. It gave me a sense of peace. It imbued in me my own sense of my "Jewishness." I don&#39;t consider myself qualified to go around claiming to be a Jew. But I&#39;m proud to be one anyway. I like who I am. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>I respect your mother&#39;s strengthraising 12 kids on her own. What sustained her after both her husbands had passed on? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> She was a very religious woman. And her faith in God is what has sustained her. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Most of what you write is nonfiction. Do you write fiction? Which do you feel more comfortable with? How do they differ for you? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> Before I started writing Quincy Jones&#39;s biography for Doubleday, which I began last February, I was working on a novel for Riverhead. I enjoyed it immensely, though it was much more difficult than nonfiction. I plan to finish  that novel after finishing Quincy&#39;s biography. That&#39;s due in late 1998. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>THE COLOR OF WATER chronicles each time you asked your mother about her past. Is this book a record of your personal odyssey to find out who you are? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> In a way, yes. I wrote the book partly because I didn&#39;t know who I was. And I realized I couldn&#39;t discover who I was until I discovered who my mother was. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>You attended a segregated school in Wilmington, Delaware. Could you comment on your experience there and how it differed from the schools in New York? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> The schools in New York were better. The variety of students added to my education. There were good things about the segregated school. The teachers were very kind and very educated, but I got a far better education in the New York City schools that were integrated. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>I&#39;ve read that you are a very talented musician, although I&#39;ve never heard anything by you. What do you play? What draws you to music? Do you feel that performing music affects your writing? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I used to perform music. No longer. I wrote songs for Anita Baker, Grover Washington, and Gary Burton. I&#39;m literally in the recording studio now, working on a demo for a Disney audition to write the score for one of their theatrical musicals. I play saxophoneall the saxophonesand I play piano and I write. I started on piano and clarinet as a boy. My mother encouraged music around the house. And no,  performing music doesn&#39;t affect my writing. I always loved music, even as a boy. I&#39;ve just always been attracted to it. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>In your book you mention, "Mommy was the wrong color for black pride and black power." Could you elaborate on that statement from a modern-day historical perspective? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> At the time, black power was a huge deal in my neighborhood, and we were all imbued with a sense of black pride and black consciousness. In that context, she did not fit. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Your childhood was hard, but you seem to successfully remember the good times. What&#39;s your favorite childhood memory? What were you doing? Who were you with? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> My favorite childhood memory is swimming in the Red Hook swimming pool with my mother, brothers, and sisters. I remember the strength in her hands and the firm way in which she held me. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Americans like to classify. Any federal form you fill out asks for your race  black, white, Native American, etc. As someone who could feasibly check all those boxes, which do you choose, if any? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I would prefer to choose "other," but I&#39;ll always choose "black." I think there should be one box  human being. But in the real world, I choose black. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Could you please recommend your favorite jazz album? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I guess I would have to answer that with three. "It Might as Well Be Swing," which is Frank Sinatra with the Count Basie Orchestra, with Quincy Jones as the arranger; "Kind of Blue" by Miles Davis; and "Stolen Moments" by Oliver Nelson. My favorite tenor saxophone player is Billy Harper. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>I haven&#39;t read the book yet,  but I am fascinated by the title. What is "the color of water"? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> When I was a little boy, I would ask my mother, "What color is God?" I asked her if God was white or black. She said God was the color of water. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Have you seen the film "Ethnic Notions"? What&#39;s your reaction to it? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I&#39;m sorry but I haven&#39;t seen it. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>First, I really enjoyed the book. Second, there&#39;s been a lot written lately about the memoir and its form of narrative, with your book and Frank McCourt&#39;s. How do you distinguish between telling a great story and telling the truth? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> What you have to do as a writer is find the gatepost moments of your story. The points of highest drama that prove your point. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Mr. McBride, I was really moved by the scene where you brought your mother back to her hometown, and to her first real friend, Frances. Did your mother feel it was worth it to come back to this place that caused her such pain, to be reunited with Frances? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> It was a catharsis for Mommy. It was painful, but wonderful and terrifyingly exhilarating for her. I was moved by it. My sister Judy was there. It was just as moving for her. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>I found it interesting that you said your household was truly ruled by the women there, but in the end, it was you who told the story of your mother. Had it ever occurred to any of your siblings to tell her story? Were they just as interested as you? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I don&#39;t think it ever occurred to any of them, but they were just as interested. My siblings felt that God had put this story in my heart, and they felt it was appropriate that I be the one to tell it. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>When you were writing from your mom&#39;s perspective, how did you change your tone so it really sounded like her? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I just climbed into her skin. And felt what it felt like to be her. It wasn&#39;t hard -- she is my mother. Eighty percent of those words were hers. <br><hr><b>Question: </b>Can you tell us about the novel that you are currently working on? <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I&#39;m working on a novel about a group of black soldiers who stumble upon a group of Jewish refugees after World War II. <br><hr><b>VogelBN: </b>Thanks so much for joining us, Mr. McBride.  We are so glad to have had you, and we hope that you will join us again with your next book! <p><b>James  McBride: </b> I&#39;m honored to be the recipient of so much love from so many people. My mother, myself, and my siblings feel truly blessed beyond words. <br><hr><b>VogelBN: </b>Your readers thank you. Have a wonderful night! <p><b>James  McBride: </b> Thank you! <hr>
<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><i>THE COLOR OF WATER: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother</i><br>by James McBride<p>&nbsp; <p><i>INTRODUCTION</i> <p>James McBride grew up one of twelve siblings in the all-black housing projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn, the son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white. The object of McBride's constant embarrassment, and his continuous fear for her safety, his mother was an inspiring figure, who through sheer force of will saw her dozen children through college, and many through graduate school. McBride was an adult before he discovered the truth about his mother: the daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi in rural Virginia, she had run away to Harlem, married a black man, and founded an all-black Baptist church in her living room in Red Hook. In this remarkable memoir, she tells in her own words the story of her past. Around her narrative, James McBride has written a powerful portrait of growing up, a meditation on race and identity, and a poignant, beautifully crafted hymn from a son to his mother. <p>&nbsp; <p><i>ABOUT JAMES MCBRIDE</i><p> <p><i>Praise</i> <p>&nbsp; <p><i>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</i> <ol> <li>Discuss Ruth McBride's refusal to reveal her past and how that influenced her children's sense of themselves and their place in the world. How has your knowledge<i>&#151;or lack thereof</i>&#151;about your family background shaped your own self-image?<br>&nbsp;<li>The McBride children's struggle with their identities led each to his or her own "revolution." Is it also possible that that same struggle led them to define themselves through professional achievement?<br>&nbsp;<li>Several of the McBride children became involved in the civil rights movement. Do you think that this was a result of the times in which they lived, their need to belong to a group that lent them a solid identity, or a combination of these factors?<br>&nbsp;<li>"<i>Our house was a combination three-ring circus and zoo, complete with ongoing action, daring feats, music, and animals</i>." Does Helen leave to escape her chaotic homelife or to escape the mother whose very appearance confuses her about who she is?<br>&nbsp;<li>"<i>It was in her sense of education, more than any other, that Mommy conveyed her Jewishness to us</i>." Do you agree with this statement? Is it possible that Ruth McBride Jordan's unshakable devotion to her faith, even though she converted to Christianity from Judaism, stems from her Orthodox Jewish upbringing?<br>&nbsp;<li>"<i>Mommy's contradictions crashed and slammed against one another like bumper cars at Coney Island. White folks, she felt, were implicitly evil toward blacks, yet she forced us to go to white schools to get the best education. Blacks could be trusted more, but anything involving blacks was probably substandard... She was against welfare and never applied for it despite our need, but championed those who availed themselves of it.</i>" Do you think these contradictions served to confuse Ruth's children further, or did they somehow contribute to the balanced view of humanity that James McBride possesses?<br>&nbsp;<li>While reading the descriptions of the children's hunger, did you wonder why Ruth did not seek out some kind of assistance?<br>&nbsp;<li>Do you think it was na&iuml;ve of Ruth McBride Jordan to think that her love for her family and her faith in God would overcome all potential obstacles or did you find her faith in God's love and guidance inspiring?<br>&nbsp;<li>How do you feel about Ruth McBride Jordan's use of a belt to discipline her children?<br>&nbsp;<li>While reading the book, were you curious about how Ruth McBride Jordan's remarkable faith had translated into the adult lives of her children? Do you think that faith is something that can be passed on from one generation to the next or do you think that faith that is instilled too strongly in children eventually causes them to turn away from it?<br>&nbsp;<li>Do you think it would be possible to achieve what Ruth McBride has achieved in today's society? </ol>
<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3>Dead<p> I'm dead. <p> You want to talk about my family and here I been dead to them for fifty years. Leave me alone. Don't bother me. They want no parts of me and me I don't want no parts of them. Hurry up and get this interview over with. I want to watch Dallas. See, my family, if you had a been part of them, you wouldn't have time for this foolishness, your roots, so to speak. You'd be better off watching the Three Stooges than to interview them, like to go interview my father, forget it. He'd have a heart attack if he saw you, He's dead now anyway, or if not he's 150 years old. <p> I was born an Orthodox Jew on April 1, 1921. April Fool's Day, in Poland. I don't remember the name of the town where I was born, but I do remember my Jewish name: Ruchel Dwajra Zylska. My parents got rid of that name when we came to America and changed it to Rachel Deborah Shilsky, and I got rid of that name when I was nineteen and never used it again after I left Virginia for good in 1941. Rachel Shilsky is dead as far as I'm concerned, She had to die in order for me, the rest me, to live. <p> My family mourned me when I married your father. They said kaddish and sat shiva. That's how Orthodox Jews mourn their dead. They say prayers, turn their mirrors down, sit on boxes for seven days, and cover their heads. It's a real workout, which is maybe why I'm not a Jew now. There were too many rules to follow, too many forbiddens and "you can'ts" and "you mustn'ts," but does anybody say they love you? Not in my family we didn't. We didn't talk that way. We said things like, "There's a box in there for the nails," or my father would say, "Be quiet while I sleep." <p> My father's name was Fishel Shilsky and he was an Orthodox rabbi. He escaped from the Russian army and snuck over the Polish border and married my mother in an arranged marriage. He used to say he was under fire when he ran off from the army, and his ability to slick himself out of anything that wasn't good for him stayed with him for as long as I knew him. Tateh, we called him, That means father in Yiddish. He was a fox, especially when it came to money. He was short, dark, hairy, and gruff. He wore a white shirt, black pants, and a tallis on his shirtsleeve, and that was like his uniform, He'd wear those black pants till they glazed and shined and were ripe enough to stand in the corner by themselves, but God help you if those pants were coming your way in a hurry, because he was nobody to fool with, my father. He was hard as a rock. <p> My mother was named Hudis and she was the exact opposite of him, gentle and meek. She was born in 1896 in the town of Dobryzn, Poland, but if you checked there today, nobody would remember her family because any Jews who didn't leave before Hitler got through with Poland were wiped out in the Holocaust. She was pretty about the face. Dark hair, high cheekbones, but she had polio. It paralyzed her left side and left her in overall poor health. Her left hand was useless. It was bent at the wrist and held close to her chest, She was nearly blind in her left eye and walked with a severe limp, dragging her left foot behind her. She was a quiet woman, my sweet Mameh, That's what we called her, Mameh. She's one person in this world I didn't do right by....
