											I bought this book for The Amazon's Curse, and was thrilled when it also came with the 1st (prequel) story of the Lord's of the Underworld, The Darkest Fire, which tells a sweet love story how the box made of a goddess's bones (home to bound demons) became Pandora's responsibility to guard. I felt spoiled that I got to read that story before I had a chance to start on The Darkest Night. If you're a huge fan of the series, the bonus features are great to read as well. I now know all about the characters before even starting the series...and I love them all already! William is my favorite - his interviews with the Lords was the most entertaining part of the book. I read it four times he was so funny!! The Amazon's Curse could have been longer, The Atlantis Series is one of my favorites, but it was nice to see Zane and Nola have their happy ending along with everyone else. The Darkest Prison was a bonus story for fans, involving Atlas (Titan of Strength) and the Goddess of Strength. It was an enjoyable read...and now the two are on the run from Cronos (The Titan Ruler), after each of their escapes from his prison, looking for the Lords of the Underworld for help. I'll be anxious to see how that goes! lol</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Can I Get A Flashlight?<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=moviemavenjocie">moviemavenjocie</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1391492_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780373774517_BK_1_1391492" href="#previewReview_1391492" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 18, 2010: 
											I thought this book would be a great introduction to &quot;The Lords of The Underground&quot; series. I really enjoy her writing and I was looking to see what her other series would be like. The first story was very dark but it did have a sad/sweet ending. The second story was my favorite. &quot;The Amazon's Curse&quot; was a continuation from the &quot;The Vampire's Bride&quot;. I was really happy how the story ended. The last story was my least favorite. I was very disappointed because the stories were less that a 100 pages long and I felt more could have been said about each one. The rest of the book is filled with interviews, definitions, and roundtable discussions. The second story in this anthology made the purchase of this book well worth it.  I really think that it should/could have stood alone. I don't think I will be reading any of the &quot;Lords of The Underground&quot; series I think that it is just a little to dark for me.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/44150000/44153914.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Gena Showalter</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>School of Hard Knocks</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.genashowalter.com">* Gena Showalter's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Gena Showalter is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of Paranormal Romance, Contemporary Romance, and Young Adult novels from a multitude of publishers.

She is a self proclaimed coffee addict and when she's not writing she likes to...well, we're not sure.  We've never seen her do anything but write.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>In the fall of 2009, Gena Showalter took some time to talk with us about her favorite books, authors, and interests.</i><br><br>  <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer -- and why?</b><br>  <i>Warrior's Woman</i> by Johanna Lindsey.  Before this book, I had only ever read historical romances.  But I was intrigued by the idea of a futuristic society, spaceships, females who could kick ass, and strong alpha men.  Then I started reading and intrigue became utter adoration.  I loved the story, and I realized I could write about anything I could imagine.<br><br>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b>  <br>  <i>A Hunger Like No Other</i> by Kresley Cole.  The hero chews and claws off his own leg to reach the heroine.  Now that is an act of love!  I'm still waiting for someone to do this for me.  But I digress.  I was glued to every page, couldn't put this down, and actually threatened my family with bodily harm when they dared interrupt my reading.  This is a true masterpiece, as well as the most amazing start to a series that I've ever read!  But then, <i>all</i> of Cole's books are masterpieces.    <br><br>  <i>Beyond the Highland Mist</i> by Karen Moning.  This was the first book I ever read featuring time travel and the Fae.  Plus, Karen paints such a vivid picture, I always feel like I'm in the book with the characters.  In this one, I time traveled with the heroine, I was seduced by the hero, and I was enveloped by magic.  To all three I say yes, yes, a thousand times yes.  <br><br>  <i>Welcome to Temptation</i> by Jennifer Cruise.  I have never laughed so hard while reading a book.  Cruise has the most amazing sense of humor -- humor that stems from her characters and their lives, rather than slapstick.  What's more, her characters are people I want so badly to hang out with.<br><br>    <i>Demon Moon</i> by Meljean Brook.  A vampire hero who knows how beautiful he is yet can't look into a mirror.  An everyday heroine I could identify with, even be.  And wow, is this book sexy!  Brook made me believe her characters were falling in love and by the end, I knew they were meant to be together.    <br><br>  <i>Slave to Sensation</i> by Nalini Singh.  A heroine who has been taught not to feel and a hero who lives by his emotions.  They balanced each other out, and watching them fall in love was so amazingly beautiful.  This is a truly powerful book.  <br><br>  <i>Warrior Rising</i> by P. C. Cast.  I love how P.C. twisted the story of Hercules to make it her own.  In this book, he has a beast trapped inside him and that's why he is such an indomitable, ferocious warrior.  Throw in a modern day heroine, white-hot attraction, and it's an instant page-turner! <br><br>    <i>Hitting the Mark</i> by Jill Monroe.  A hero undercover, a con artist heroine trying to go straight.  Perfection!  I loved their banter -- and the fact that the heroine wasn't afraid to dish the most delicious kind of revenge.  And then, how the two overcame their problems -- dreamy sigh.    <br><br>  <i>Twilight</i> by Stephenie Meyer.  I love the intensity of the hero's love.  I love how irresistible he finds the heroine.  I love how much they need each other.  Once I started reading, I couldn't stop.  First love meets true, everlasting love, and that's an irresistible combination for me.  <br><br>  <i>Lover Awakened</i> by J. R. Ward.  The hero was abused for many years, is physically scarred, and wants nothing to do with love.  But the heroine is attracted to him, and knows they belong together.  Plus, she's been abused, as well, and feels safest with him.  This book shows the healing power of love, is packed with gut-wrenching emotion and is utterly compelling.  <br><br>  <i>Red Fire</i> by Deidre Knight.  I was sold the moment I saw the book was about sexy Spartan warriors (I have a thing for warriors)  But there is so much more to the book.  It's an amazing blend of urban fantasy and romance, with those delicious warriors I mentioned, fighting gods and demons in modern day Savannah.  I love the way history, mythology and romance come together!   <br><br>  <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>    <i>Twilight</i>.  I loved seeing one of my favorite love stories come to life.<br><br>  <i>Anchorman</i>.  I laugh every time I watch this movie.  Will Ferrell is a comic genius.<br><br>  <i>Braveheart</i>.  Snippets of history, love, and the heartbreak of war.  So touching!<br><br>  <i>Idiocracy</i>.  Hilarious!  But hopefully not true.      <br><br>  <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b>  <br>    My tastes are eclectic.  Rock, pop, gospel, ballads, soundtracks, you name it, it's listed in my iTunes library and playing while I write.  <br><br>  <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b> <br>    Romances.  Always.  Especially the first in a series.  If l enjoy a series, I want the rest of the world to read and enjoy it, as well.  <br><br>  <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b>  <br>  I drink coffee while I write.  That way, I don't hurt the people around me and my characters get to live another day.  <br><br>  <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b>  <br>    I have so many rejection slips I can't even count them.  It took me four-five years to sell (after writing seven books).  Then it took me another four painful years to start hitting bestseller lists.  <br><br>  <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>    Write the book the way it needs to be written, not the way you think others will want you to write it.  If you love the story, that love will shine through.  Magic will happen.  <br><br></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P><b>Three otherworldly tales from the master of paranormal romance&hellip;and a brand-new Lords of the Underworld bonus guide!</b><P><i>The Darkest Fire</i>&mdash;a Lords of the Underworld prequel<P>Geryon is the guardian of hell, more monster than man.

He should not have studied her that first time and should have kept his gaze downcast all the times since. He was a slave to the prince of darkness, spawned by evil; she was a goddess, created in light.<P>He could not have her, he thought, hands fisting. No matter how much he might wish otherwise. She would not want him anyway. This&hellip;obsession was pointless and brought him nothing but despair. He did not need more despair.<P>And yet, still he watched her this day as she floated through the barren cavern, coral-tipped fingers tracing the jagged stones that separated underground from underworld. Golden ringlets flowed down her elegant back and framed a face so perfect, so lovely, Aphrodite herself could not compare. Eyes of starlight narrowed, a rosy color blooming in those cheeks of smooth alabaster.<P>&#34;The wall is cracked,&#34; she said, her voice like a song amid the hiss of nearby flames&mdash;and the unnatural screams that always accompanied them.<P>He shook his head, positive he had merely imagined the words. In all their centuries together, they had never spoken, never deviated from their routine. As the Guardian of Hell, he ensured the gate remained closed until a spirit needed to be cast inside. That way, no one and nothing escaped&mdash;and if they tried, he rendered punishment. As the goddess of Oppression, she fortified the physical barrier with only a touch. Silence was never breeched.<P>Uncertainty darkened her features. &#34;Have you nothing to say?&#34;<P>She stood in front of him a moment later, though he never saw her move. The scent of honeysuckle suddenly overshadowed the stink of sulfur and melting flesh, and he inhaled deeply, closing his eyes in ecstasy. Oh, that she would remain just as she was.&hellip;<P>&#34;Guardian,&#34; she prompted.<P>&#34;Goddess.&#34; He forced his lids to open gradually, slowly revealing the glow of her beauty. Up close, she was not as perfect as he had thought. She was better. A smattering of freckles dotted her sweetly sloped nose, and dimples appeared with the curve of her half-smile. Exquisite.<P>What did she think of <i>him? </i>he wondered.<P>She probably thought him a monster, hideous and misshapen. Which he was. But if she thought so, she did not show it. Only curiosity rested in those starlight eyes. For the wall, he suspected, not for him. Even when he'd been human, women had wanted nothing to do with him. They'd run from him the moment he'd turned his attention to them. He'd been too tall, too brawny, too bumbling. And that was <i>before </i>he'd resembled an ogre.<P>Sometimes he wondered if he'd been tainted at birth.<P>&#34;Those cracks were not there yesterday,&#34; she said. &#34;What has caused such damage? And so swiftly?&#34;<P>&#34;A horde of Demon Lords rise from the pit daily and fight to break out. They have grown tired of their confinement here and seek living humans to torment.&#34;<P>She accepted the news without reaction. &#34;Have you their names?&#34;<P>He nodded. He did not need to see beyond the gate to know who visited on the other side; he sensed it. Always. &#34;Violence, Death, Lies, Doubt, Misery. Shall I go on?&#34;<P>&#34;No,&#34; she said softly. &#34;I understand. The worst of the worst.&#34;<P>&#34;Yes. They bang and they claw from the other side, desperate to reach the mortal realm.&#34;<P>&#34;Well, stop them.&#34; A command, laced with husky entreaty.<P>If only. He would have given up the last vestiges of his humanity to do as she wished. Anything to repay the daily gift of her presence. Anything to keep her just where she was, prolonging the sweetness of her scent. &#34;I am forbidden to leave my post, just as I am forbidden to open the gates for any reason but allowing one of the damned inside. I'm afraid I cannot grant your request.&#34;<P>Besides, the only way to stop a determined demon was to kill it, and killing a High Lord was another forbidden act.<P>A sigh slipped from her. &#34;Do you always do as you're told?&#34;<P>&#34;Always.&#34; Once he had fought the invisible ties that bound him. Once, but no longer. To fight was to invite pain and suffering&mdash;not for him, but for others. Innocent humans who resembled his mother, his father and his brothers&mdash; because his true mother, father and brothers had already been slain&mdash;were brought here and tortured in front of him. The screams&hellip; oh, the screams. Far worse than the ones that seeped from Hell. And the sights&hellip; He shuddered.<P>Had the pain and suffering been heaped upon <i>him, </i>he would not have cared. Would have laughed and fought all the harder. What was a little more pain? But Lucifer, brother to Hades and prince of the demons, needed him healthy, whole, so had found other ways to gain his cooperation.<P>The memories would forever haunt him, but might have faded during the night, if he'd required sleep. He remained awake, however, every hour of every day, never able to forget.<P>&#34;Obedience. I expected differently from you,&#34; she said. &#34;You are a warrior, so strong and assured.&#34;<P>Yes, he was a warrior. But he was also a slave. One did not cancel out the other. &#34;I am sorry, goddess. My strength and assurance change nothing.&#34;<P>&#34;I will pay you to help me,&#34; she insisted. &#34;Name your price. Whatever you desire shall be yours.&#34;<P>If only, Geryon thought again. He would ask for a single taste of her lips.<P>Why limit himself, though? he wondered next. <i>Whatever he desired. </i>He could ask for a night in her arms. Naked. Touching. Tasting. Yes. <i>Yes. </i>Every muscle in his body clenched. In arousal. In desperation.<P>In despair.<P>No. He could not risk the suffering of the innocent&mdash;<i>why do you bother with them?</i>&mdash;simply to sate his craving for the lovely goddess. So have a kiss? A night with her? No again.<P><i>Finally I know true torture. </i>He ground his teeth. Why did he bother? Because without good, there would be only evil. And he had seen too much evil over the centuries. He would not be responsible for more.<P>&#34;Guardian?&#34; the goddess prompted. <i>&#34;Anything.&#34;</i><P>Do not speak. Do not do this. Geryon gulped. &#34;I am sorry, goddess.&#34; <i>No. Say no more. Ask for that kiss, at the very least. </i>&#34;As I told you, I cannot help you.&#34; <i>No, no, no.</i><P>How he hated himself just then.<P>Her delicate shoulders sagged in disappointment, and his self-hatred grew. &#34;But&hellip; why? You want to keep the demons in Hell just as much as I do. Right?&#34;<P>&#34;Right.&#34; Geryon didn't want to tell her his reasons for refusing her, was still ashamed after all this time. Tell her, however, he would. Perhaps then she would return to the old ways and pretend he did not exist. As it was, his craving for her was deepening, intensifying, his body hardening. Readying.<P><i>She's not for you.</i><P>How many times would he need the reminder before this conversation ended?<P>&#34;I sold my soul,&#34; he admitted. He had been one of the first humans to walk the earth. Despite his massive build and bumbling ways, he'd been content with his lot and enraptured by his mate, even though she'd been chosen by his family and, like all the other females of his acquaintance, had not desired him in return.<P>A year into their marriage, she had grown sick, and he had despaired. Though she had found no joy with him, she had belonged to him, and ensuring her safety and well-being had been his duty. So he had cried out to the gods for assistance.<P>They had ignored him, and his despair became unbearable.<P>That was when Lucifer appeared before him. So cunning, that one was.<P>To save his mate&mdash;and perhaps finally win her heart&mdash; Geryon had willingly given himself to the dark prince. And found himself transformed from man to beast. Horns had sprouted atop his head, and his hands had become clubs, his nails claws. Dark, carmine fur had covered the skin on his legs, while hooves replaced his feet.<P>In seconds, he'd been more animal than human.<P>His wife had healed, as his contract with Lucifer stated, but she had not softened toward Geryon. No, his selfless act had meant nothing to her and she had left him for another man. A man she had apparently been seeing all along.<P>What a fool he'd been. A cuckold. <i>All for nothing.</i><P>&#34;What thoughts fill your head, Guardian? Never have you appeared so&hellip;broken.&#34;<P>The goddess. His hands fisted, claws digging deep into his palms, as he refocused on her. There had been compassion in her tone. Compassion he must ignore. Unemotional, that's how he had to be. Always. Otherwise, he would not survive his time here.<P>&#34;My actions are no longer mine to command. No matter how I wish otherwise, I cannot help you. Now please. Don't you have duties to attend to?&#34;<P>&#34;I am doing my duty now. Are you?&#34;<P>He flushed.<P>She sighed. &#34;Forgive my waspishness. I am frazzled.&#34; The goddess studied him, her head tilting to the side. He shifted uncomfortably, such scrutiny unnerving given his sickening appearance. To his surprise, revulsion did not darken her lovely gaze as she said, &#34;Your soul belongs to the dark prince?&#34;<P>&#34;Yes.&#34;<P>&#34;And if your soul was returned to you, you would aid me?&#34;<P>&#34;Yes,&#34; he repeated, the word a croak. Would she still offer him a boon for that aid?<P>&#34;Very well. I will see what I can do.&#34;<P>His eyes widened in horror. Approach Lucifer? &#34;No, you must&mdash;&#34;<P>She disappeared before he could stop her.<P><i>Inner Corridors of Hell</i><P>&#34;Lucifer, hear me well. I demand to speak with you. You <i>will </i>appear before me. This day, in this room. Alone. I will remain exactly as I am.&#34; Kadence, goddess of Oppression, knew to state her wants precisely or the demon prince would &#34;interpret&#34; them however he wished. &#34;And you will be clothed.&#34;<P>Were she simply to demand an audience, he might whisk her to his bed, her arms and legs tied, her clothing gone, a legion of fiends surrounding her.<P>Several minutes ticked by and there was no response to her summons. But then, she'd known there wouldn't be. He enjoyed making her wait. Made him feel powerful. <i>Keep busy. Act as if you do not care.</i><P>Kadence eyed her surroundings, as if studying them was exactly what she'd come to do. Rather than stone and mortar, the walls of Lucifer's palace were comprised of flames. Crackling, orange-gold. Deadly.<P>His throne was comprised of bone, ash and more of those flames. Off to the side was a bloodstained altar. A lifeless body still lay across it&mdash;minus a head. The head would<P>reattach all too soon, however, so that the torturing could begin anew. That was the way of it here.<P>No soul would escape. Even in death.<P>She hated everything about this place. Plumes of black smoke wafted from the blazes, curling around her like fingers of the damned. So badly she wanted to wave her hand in front of her nose, but she did not. She wouldn't show weakness&mdash;even with so small an action.<P>Did she dare, she knew she would find herself <i>drowning </i>in the noxious fumes. Lucifer loved nothing more than exploiting vulnerabilities.<P>Kadence had learned that lesson well. The first time she had visited, she'd come to inform both Hades and Lucifer that she had been appointed their warden. As one who embodied the essence of subjugation and conquest, there was no one better to ensure that demons and dead alike remained here.<P>Or so the gods had thought, which was why they'd chosen her for this task.<P>She had not agreed, but refusing them would have invited punishment. Many times since accepting, however, she'd thought perhaps punishment would have been better. Having stones thrown at her, bloody carcasses left on her doorstep in warning&hellip;they hardly compared to spending her days sleeping in a nearby cave&mdash;not a true sleep but a watchful one, her mind's eye drifting over the different demon camps. Could hardly compare to spending her nights surveying a wall of rock.<P>As the Guardian watched.<P>That, however, was not such a hardship.<P>For many years, his attention had unnerved her, for he was unlike anyone she had ever met&#58; half man, half beast, all&hellip; edge. But then she'd come to find comfort in his detached gaze. He protected her from demons and souls who slipped through the gate, attacking everyone in their path. No matter the harm to himself.<P>She could do no less for him.<P><i>I sold my soul, </i>he'd said. For what? she wondered. What had he received in return? Did he consider the trade a good one? She'd wanted to ask him, but had recalled how uncomfortable he had been with her questions about the wall. He would not have welcomed a discussion about something so personal.<P>And that was probably for the best. Only her job mattered right now. How could she not have known demon High Lords were determined to escape <i>forever?</i><P>Had Lucifer somehow blocked her visions of this realm? He was the only one strong enough to do so. If so, what did he hope to gain? Were she to ask, he would merely lie, that much she knew.<P>She'd never felt more helpless.<P>No, that wasn't true. During her first visit, Lucifer had sensed her trepidation&mdash;and he'd since used every opportunity to nurture it. A fire-coated touch here, a wicked taunt there. Every time she had come here to report an infraction, she had wilted under his attentions.<P>That had disappointed the gods. They would have called her home, she was sure, had they not already bound her to the wall, an act that had been meant to help with her duties, not hinder them. But not even the gods had known just how deeply the bond would go. Rather than simply sensing when the wall needed fortification, she'd realized it was her reason for living.<P>Her blood now sang with its essence.<P>The first time one of the demons had scratched it, she'd felt the sting and had gasped, shocked. Now, it no longer shocked her, though she still felt every contact. When a soul brushed it, her skin felt tickled. When the inferno licked at it, she felt burned. So why had she not sensed these latest ministrations?<P>Oh, she'd felt her body draining of strength, little by little, pains shooting through her seemingly for no reason, but her visions had been calm. Well, as calm as such visions could be, considering what she was forced to witness on a daily basis.<P>Now, at least, she knew why she'd hurt. Bound as she was to this dark underworld, that crack in the outer wall was literally killing her.<P><i>You are losing focus. Concentrate! </i>Distraction could cost her. Dearly. And the outcome of this meeting was more important than any that had come before it.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="product-related"><div class="btb-dsl-tc"><div class="btb-dsl-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-tc-acc"><div class="pr-width"><div class="wrap2lt"><h3 class="pr-selected accord-default-open"><a name="relatedAcc" href="#categoryTitle_Acc" data-cmelementid="Related Subjects_Accordion">Related Subjects</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on"><ul><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=924483">Other Romance Categories</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=890871">Short Story Collections (Single Author)</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=1391487">Paranormal &amp; Fantastic Romance</a></li></ul></div><div class="wrap2lt booksByThisAuthor"><h3 class="pr-selected"><a name="booksByThisAuthorAcc" href="#booksByThisAuthor_Acc" data-cmelementid="BooksByThisAuthor_Accordion" onclick="WebService.initialize({url:'http://services.barnesandnoble.com/v02_00/ProductSearch?Contributor=Gena+Showalter&amp;ProductType=Book&amp;ProductSort=Relevance&amp;ProductDetail=Brief&amp;Start=1&amp;Size=6&amp;AppId=bntemp&amp;bnoutput=jsonstring&amp;bncallback=webservicecallback', outputNode:document.getElementById('obbta'), StyleSheet:genericStyleSheet, moreLink:'http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Gena+Showalter', isBTOB:'false', ean:'9780373774517'});">More by This Author</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on" id="obbta"><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif" alt="loading animation"> loading...
