</p><h3>Annotation</h3><p>When the Grace children go to stay at their Great Aunt Lucinda's worn Victorian house, they discover a field guide to fairies and other creatures and begin to have some unusual experiences.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This snappy story, the inaugural title in The Spiderwick  Chronicles, sets the scene for the next four books planned. The  authors introduce the three Grace siblings-13-year-old Mallory  and nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon-and their recently  divorced mother, who move into their great-aunt's dilapidated  Victorian house. The  paper-over-board volume opens to a Victorian-style design; a  full-page, framed pen-and-ink scene appears opposite each  chapter opening (with clever headings such as "In Which There  Are Answers, Though Not Necessarily to the Right Questions").  After Jared hears scuttling inside the walls, Mallory pokes a  broom through a kitchen wall and discovers a "nest" filled with  unusual trinkets-a doll's head, tiny lead soldiers, bits of  tattered fabric-plus one of her own fencing medals. Jared  encounters more mystery when a dumbwaiter carries him to a  doorless upstairs library. Here he spies a yellowing riddle in  rhyme (reproduced on a glossy insert), which leads him to the  attic and ultimately to Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the  Fantastical World Around You-a handbook to the faerie realm.  Often in trouble, Jared gets the blame for some odd occurrences  (e.g., Mallory awakens to find her hair tied in knots around her  headboard, Simon's tadpoles are frozen into ice cubes, etc.). Appealing  characters, well-measured suspense and an inviting package will  lure readers on to The Seeing Stone (-85937-6), due the same  month. Youngsters may well find themselves glancing over their  shoulders as they eagerly follow the events. Ages 6-10. (May)   Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.

											The "Spiderwick Chronicles the Field Guide" by Tony Diterlizzi and published by Simon and Schuster Books, is a very good book. It really makes you feel like you are standing in a dark hallway with Jarred or fighting monsters with Mallory and Simon. The adventures that the three of them go on are just amazing. It makes you never want to put the book down.  Once you have finished the book, you have a strong desire to go out and buy the next book in the series. My favorite part in the book is when Jarred finally gets into the attic. He finds all kinds of interesting stuff; the walls are covered in book shelves and there are pictures all over the place. But the most interesting part was when he found a book that read "A History of Scottish Dwarves, a Compendium of Brownie Visitations from around the World, and an Etomy of Insects and other Flying Creatures". I think that was a very cool part.<p/> <p/>I recommend this book to every one who likes adventures, monsters, and other cool creatures. If you don't like this Fantasy/Science Fiction then I feel sorry for you, because you won't read this book.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Spider wick chronicles book one<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=stockdale">stockdale</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1322255_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780689859366_BK_7_1322255" href="#previewReview_1322255" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>February 24, 2010: 
											There was three kids they just moved into there aunts house. They found a dumbwaiter. The dumbwaiter went up to a old library. <p/> Jared got into the dumbwaiter and went up to the dark library and in the old library they had old books. Then after they found the old library they found a trunk in the attic that Jared found. He found a old book in the trunk and when he started to read it bad stuff has been happening to the kids. They have been looking for the thing that has been doing that stuff to them.<p/> I liked this book because it is a mystery. My favorite part is where bad stuff has been happening to them.<p/> In conclusion I think this book is an adventure that all the kids will relate to them.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>The Barnes & Noble Review</b><br>Three curious kids discover a world of brownies, fairies, and other fantastic creatures in this ultra-enchanting launch to Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black's Spiderwick Chronicles.<p>

When the three Grace children -- Mallory, Jared, and Simon -- and their mom move into Aunt Lucinda's old house, readers know there's magic afoot. The kids uncover a nest of assembled junk, and on a visit to the secret library via the dumbwaiter, Jared finds a note describing "my secret to all mankind." After a few mysterious pranks that get blamed on Jared, the boy finally digs up the real prize: <i>Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You.</i> Fortunately enough, the kids meet one of the critters listed in the guide -- a brownie named Thimbletack -- who makes it all "real" and helps provide the book's suspenseful conclusion: "'Throw the book away, toss it in a fire. If you do not heed, you will draw their ire.'"<p>

From the book's bewitching cover to the Grace kids' letter to the authors, <i>Book 1: The Field Guide</i> is a fast-paced beginning to an exciting new series. Fans of Harry Potter, Lemony Snicket, or Diana Wynne Jones will be hooked on Spiderwick, and they'll thirst for more. DiTerlizzi and Black have done it right. <I>Matt Warner</I>

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This snappy story, the inaugural title in The Spiderwick  Chronicles, sets the scene for the next four books planned. The  authors introduce the three Grace siblings-13-year-old Mallory  and nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon-and their recently  divorced mother, who move into their great-aunt's dilapidated  Victorian house. The  paper-over-board volume opens to a Victorian-style design; a  full-page, framed pen-and-ink scene appears opposite each  chapter opening (with clever headings such as "In Which There  Are Answers, Though Not Necessarily to the Right Questions").  After Jared hears scuttling inside the walls, Mallory pokes a  broom through a kitchen wall and discovers a "nest" filled with  unusual trinkets-a doll's head, tiny lead soldiers, bits of  tattered fabric-plus one of her own fencing medals. Jared  encounters more mystery when a dumbwaiter carries him to a  doorless upstairs library. Here he spies a yellowing riddle in  rhyme (reproduced on a glossy insert), which leads him to the  attic and ultimately to Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the  Fantastical World Around You-a handbook to the faerie realm.  Often in trouble, Jared gets the blame for some odd occurrences  (e.g., Mallory awakens to find her hair tied in knots around her  headboard, Simon's tadpoles are frozen into ice cubes, etc.). Appealing  characters, well-measured suspense and an inviting package will  lure readers on to The Seeing Stone (-85937-6), due the same  month. Youngsters may well find themselves glancing over their  shoulders as they eagerly follow the events. Ages 6-10. (May)   Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.

								Children's Literature</h3><p><I>The Field Guide</I> is Book 1 in a new series of books about twins, Jared and Simon Grace, who along with their sister, Mallory, and their mom move into the rundown Spiderwick Estate of their great-aunt Lucinda after their father leaves them. Upon seeing the shabby old Victorian, Mom says it is just like she remembers it. "Only crappier," adds Mallory. That night, strange things happen which lead Jared, Simon, and Mallory to believe they are being tormented by fairies and brownies. The children find a secret room, an odd book (which turns out to be a field guide to fairies), and eventually a little house brownie named Thimbletack who is about the size of a pencil and talks in rhyme. Readers who like the Unfortunate Events series will probably enjoy this series�"The Spiderwick Chronicles." Detailed illustrations help bring the strange world of Spiderwick alive. Short paragraphs and "cliffhanger" chapters make the book especially unintimidating and intriguing for young readers. 2003, Simon & Schuster Children's Publishing,</p><h3>Diane Emge

								VOYA</h3><p>Nine-year-old Jared Grace would have been kicked out of school for breaking that kid's nose, but his family was already moving away. Since their father left them, Jared, his twin brother, Simon, and their thirteen-year-old sister, Mallory, have no choice but to move with their mother to Spiderwick Estate, her elderly Aunt Lucinda's wretchedly decayed mansion. Jared is the one who first discovers the supernatural elements lingering in the old place, but who will believe him after all the trouble he has been causing? Gradually, all three children are pulled into the adventures, which involve boggarts, goblins, griffins, and other assorted mystical beings. Field Guide is the first volume of "The Spiderwick Chronicles". It establishes the family dynamics and introduces the reader to the possibilities of otherworldly beings. It is not necessary to read the first volume before the second, because everything is quickly recapped at the start of the second book. Seeing Stone is less subtle in tone, as the children begin an active battle against goblins, develop an affiliation with a griffin, and outwit a troll. The real magic of this series, however, is in the illustrations. Nearly every second page is embellished with the ink drawings of DiTerlizzi, evoking a delicious classical sense in this modern fantasy. Black, author of Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale (Simon & Schuster, 2002/VOYA October 2002), keeps the dialogue snappy and the children's personalities distinct. The series' intended audience seems to be the Lemony Snicket crowd, a little younger than the general young adult market. Nevertheless, the series will surely develop a devoted following, particularly with avid fantasy readers.

PLB</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p>Gr 3-6-As this new series begins, Jared, Simon, and Mallory  Grace move with their mother into their Great-Aunt Lucinda's  old, decaying house, where they discover a secret room. A poetic  clue leads Jared to a book that offers detailed information  about the different types of magical creatures that live in our  world. After the inadvertent destruction of the home and  treasures of the boggart who inhabits the room leads to  increasingly more malicious tricks, Jared is blamed. With the  help of the Field Guide, the boy realizes that the small  creature is at fault and is able to pacify him. Thimbletack  warns Jared and his siblings that reading the book will only  lead to trouble, which is what comes to pass in the second  volume, when Simon is kidnapped by goblins, leaving Jared and  Mallory to come to his rescue. Details like Thimbletack's tiny  house, Jared's use of a dumbwaiter to discover the hidden room,  and the fights against the goblins will catch readers'  attention. However, the Grace children stand out only for  surface characteristics like Simon's many pets and Mallory's  passion for fencing. Adult characters remain offstage or exist  only to discipline and disbelieve the children. The many  text-enhancing black-and-white drawings give the "Spiderwick  Chronicles" a look that resembles Lemony Snicket's "A Series of  Unfortunate Events" (HarperCollins), and the presentation as  based on the Grace children's factual story as told to the  authors gives it a similar tone, which should add to the books'  appeal. While the characters' lack of depth detracts from the  quality of these titles, the fast, movielike pace will grab  young readers.-Beth L.

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Unexplained things are happening in the eerie Victorian heap that is new home to the Grace family. Rustlings in the decrepit walls lead the three children, to discover and destroy the nest of a Brownie and to locate, in Arthur Spiderwick's secret library, his Field Guide to the Fantastical World, which details the habits of faeries. The infuriated Brownie exacts retribution in hateful ways: knotting Mallory's long hair to her headboard and freezing animal-loving Simon's tadpoles into ice cubes. The children mollify the Brownie by building him another home, but against his warnings that harm will result, keep the Field Guide. Book 2 (The Seeing Stone, 0-689-95937-6) steps up the peril: the unheeded warnings lead to Simon's kidnapping by a roving gang of goblins. His siblings gain The Sight by means of a small stone lens (and efficacious goblin spit rubbed into the eyes) and succeed in rescuing him. Cleverly marketed as too dangerous to read, handsomely designed, and extravagantly illustrated this packs quite a punch. Readers who are too young to read Harry Potter independently will find these have just the right amount of menace laced with appealing humor and are blessed with crisp pacing and, of course, DiTerlizzi's enticingly Gothic illustrations.
