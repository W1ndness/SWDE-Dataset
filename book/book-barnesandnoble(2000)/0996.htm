<p>By the time she turned thirty, Elizabeth Gilbert had everything a modern, educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want&mdash;a husband, a house in the country, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love and the complete eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be.
<p>To recover from all of this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, left her loved ones behind and undertook a year-long journey around the world, all alone. <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> is the chronicle of that year. Gilbert's aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature, set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Italy, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, where, with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise Texan, she embarked on four months of austere spiritual exploration. Finally, in Indonesia, she sought her ultimate goal: balance&mdash;namely, how to somehow build a life of equilibrium between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. Looking for these answers on the island of Bali, she became the pupil of an elderly, ninth-generation medicine man and also fell in love in the very best way&mdash;unexpectedly.
<p> A memoir of self-discovery, <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment. It is also about the adventures that can transpire when a woman stops trying to live in imitation of society's ideals. This is a story certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Grace Lichtenstein</h3><p>The only thing wrong with this readable, funny memoir of a magazine writer's yearlong travels across the world in search of pleasure and balance is that it seems so much like a Jennifer Aniston movie.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>Known for her in-depth profiles for magazines from <I>Harper's Bazaar</I> to <I>GQ</I>, Elizabeth Gilbert has developed a reputation for relaying  what makes people tick, both in her reportage and her acclaimed works of fiction.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><div id="flashcontent"></div><SCRIPT language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://natalie.feedroom.com/fr_embed.js"></SCRIPT><SCRIPT type="text/javascript">

A finalist for the 1998 PEN/Hemingway Award, <I>Pilgrims</I> was also selected as a <I>New York Times Notable Book</I>, was listed as one of the "Most Intriguing Books of 1997" by <I>Glamour</I> magazine, and  went on to win best first fiction awards from <I>The Paris Review</I>, <I>The Southern Review</I>, and <I>Ploughshares</I>.<p>     Since then, Gilbert has successfully alternated between fiction and nonfiction -- a high-wire act that has paid off in a string of critically acclaimed bestsellers that includes her first full-length novel, <I>Stern Men</I> (2000); <I>The Last American Man</I> (2002), a National Book Award for Nonfiction;  and <I>Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India, and Indonesia</I> (2006), a celebrated spiritual memoir that landed on several year-end Best Books lists. <P></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some fun and fascinating outtakes from our interview with Gilbert:</I> <p>    <b>"I was once observed talking in my sleep</b>, smiling with deep bliss as I said, �Ah...the writer's life!'"<p>    <b>"I was a terrible crybaby and coward as a child</b>. I still cry a lot and am afraid of many things, like, for instance, surfing, skiing, and the possibility that somebody somewhere might be mad at me." <P>    <b>"I once accosted Wally Shawn in a restaurant where I was a waitress</b> and he was a patron. I said to him something like, �You're a lovely, lovely man who writes lovely, lovely plays! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, Wally Shawn!' He backed away slowly." <p>    <b>"I am far more of a loner than people would imagine.</b> But I am the most gregarious and socially interactive loner you ever met. The thing is, I am fascinated by people's stories and I'm very talkative and can't ever say No to anything or anyone, so I tend to over-socialize, to give away too much of my time to the many people I adore. Therefore, one of the only ways I can ever be alone is if I go traveling solo. This is the secret reason I travel so much, and to such distant places. To get away from everyone I know. I love my friends and family, but I also love it when they can't find me and I can spend all day reading or walking all alone, in silence, eight thousand miles away from everyone. All alone and unreachable in a foreign country is one my most favorite possible things to be." <p>    <b>"The Disney movie <I>Coyote Ugly</I> was based on an article I wrote</b> for <I>GQ</I> about my experience as a bartender in an East Village dive. I just had to add that bizarre fact because I still can't really believe it myself."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2006, Elizabeth Gilbert took some time out to talk with us about some of her favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  Generally speaking, anything by Charles Dickens. I got started young on Dickens. My mother used to read us <I>A Christmas Carol</I> every year around the holidays, and my father, when I was 14, suggested that I might like <I>Great Expectations</I>, which I did. As I grew older, I worked my way up to the more difficult novels, and finally read <I>Bleak House</I> in my late teens and was staggered by its delights. Nothing I have ever read has filled me with more wonder. I love the compassion and sentimentality and breadth, and I use as my own example his businesslike approach to his task, the lack of tormented drama in his personal life that enabled him to be so ridiculously productive. When I was struggling through my own first novel, I turned to <I>"Bleak House</I> again and studied it like a primer on how to tell a story, how to differentiate characters -- basically, how to write a novel. He is the best teacher I've ever had. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Bleak House</I> by Charles Dickens -- I can open this book to any page and be in the dazzling presence of a master. <p>    <li><I>Leaves of Grass</I> by Walt Whitman -- Our own beautiful American mystical prophet -- this is the most sacred text I know.<p>    <li><I>London Fields</I> by Martin Amis -- Indefensible and misanthropic and evil and delicious and dirty. <p>    <li><I>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog</I> by Dylan Thomas -- My favorite collection of short stories ever, heart-punchingly beautiful and tragic and sublime.<p>    <li><I>Close Range</I> by Annie Proulx -- My favorite living American author. Like everyone else who read the short story "Brokeback Mountain" for the first time, I was struck-down by the sheer, bare, unflinching power of it. <p>    <li><I>Meditations</I> by Marcus Aurelius -- I keep this in the bathroom and read from it, literally, every day. I like his humble, common-sense and somehow very contemporary philosophy. <p>    <li><I>Refusing Heaven</I> by Jack Gilbert -- The purest artist writing poetry today. If the topic is not the very nature of dignity, wonder, humanity and grace, he isn't interested in writing about it.<p>    <li><I>Portrait of a Lady</I> by Henry James -- I relate to Isabel Archer more than I do to any character in literature. I wrote my novel <I>Stern Men</I> as a reply to this book -- my own sort of optimistic American answer to its haunting old world questions. <p>    <li><I>The Gift</I> by Hafiz, translated by Daniel Ladinsky -- I guess maybe you could call Hafiz the 14th century Persian version of Walt Whitman. An incandescent, ecstatic pipeline to God.<p>    <li><I>The Rings of Saturn</I> by W. G. Sebald -- Sebald's writing was something between elegy, poetry, contemplation, diaries. Nobody wrote, or thought, or -- I dare say -- FELT quite like him. I read his sentences with my heart in my throat. Every word is important, deep and resonant -- like chords played on a distant cello. We lost him too soon. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  I'm a real populist. I can never answer this question without mentioning <I>Raiders of the Lost Ark</I>. I go to the movies to be entertained and thrilled. Libraries and churches are for intellectual meditation -- movies are for popcorn. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I can't listen to anything when I'm writing -- not the radio, not music, not voices. I envy my friends who are painters because they can listen and work at the same time. I need stillness, largely because I tend to read aloud to myself as I'm working (this also means nobody can work in the same room with me.) I love old country music, girls-with-guitars-and-broken-hearts music, Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Patty Griffith, Johnny Cash, and Willie Nelson. But I've gotten out of the habit of listening to music at all lately -- maybe because I'm writing too much? <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  My feeling about literature is the same as my feeling about furniture -- it is meant to be used. There's no reason to keep a piece of furniture in your house that is so sacred and rare that you can't put your feet up on it and a dog can't jump up on it. Likewise, a book that sits on a shelf like a piece of porcelain, only to be admired, never to be read again, is a dead book. I try not to make my bookshelves into graveyards, so I'm constantly giving books away by the dozen. The minute I'm finished with a great book, I pass it on. I like to see books circling around, living and breathing and being enjoyed, getting handled and dropped and read in the bathtub and marked up with exclamation points. The more I like the book, the less likely that I'll keep it. <P>    As far as what I like to receive -- just like every other devoted bookworm, my favorite four words are, "You Gotta Read This." <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have an all-encompassing lifelong writing ritual, which is to say -- I regard it as a holy practice, a devotional act, an expression of love. Every day. So that's my general approach. My daily practice changes based on what will help me best manifest that holy practice that day. I used to be more superstitious than I am now (I could only write with certain pens, at certain hours of the day, etc.) but now I think of my muse as tough, sweaty, sleeves-rolled up angel, who likes to get into it in every possible way -- not only when the stars are all aligned and I am facing East. I try to give her all the room and freedom she wants to jump out of me whenever and wherever possible. <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I guess you could say I'm an overnight success who took about six years to become one. I collected rejection notes from the time I was about 18 until I was about 24. I didn't love being rejected, but it didn't slay me, either. I'd made my vows (almost like becoming a nun) to a life of writing and, while I was really hoping for success, that wasn't entirely the point. There was simply nothing else I wanted to do, or was much good at. Of course I have an ego, like everyone does, but it's not super-sized for some reason when it comes to writing. (It's much more of a problem in romantic relationships, but that's another story.) I have a reverential relationship with this work. I love the process. I think I am the luckiest person in the world that I get to do this as a career.<P>    Once I finally got published, doors opened fast and wide to me and I've tried to gamely hop through as many of them as I can. I think my enthusiasm has helped launch me. I think editors have enjoyed working with me for that reason. Because I have become relatively successful now, I guess I've lost any credibility to say, "I honestly wouldn't have minded writing forever with no success at all." Who would believe that, if I said it? How could it be proven? But I like to think it's true. I do know this -- I love the work an awful lot. I always have. That said, of course, I'm insanely grateful for my success. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I can't get behind the ambition to be "discovered" as much as I can get behind the ambition to write beautifully and honorably and steadfastly. Here's what I believe about creativity. I believe that creativity is a living force that thrums wildly through this world and expresses itself through us. I believe that talent (the force by which ephemeral creativity gets manifested into the physical world through our hands) is a mighty and holy gift. I believe that, if you have a talent (or even if you think you do, or maybe even if you just hope you do), that you should treat that talent with the highest reverence and love. <p>    Don't flip out, in other words, and murder your gift through narcissism, insecurity, addiction, competitiveness, ambition or mediocrity. Frankly -- don't be a jerk. Just get busy, get serious, get down to it and write something, for heaven's sake. Try to get out of your own way.  Creativity itself doesn't care at all about results -- the only thing it craves is the PROCESS. Learn to love the process and let whatever happens next happen, without fussing too much about it. Work like a monk, or a mule, or some other representative metaphor for diligence. Love the work. Destiny will do what it wants with you, regardless. Just love the work. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Oddly but aptly titled, <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> is an experience to be savored: This spiritual memoir brims with humor, grace, and scorching honesty. After a messy divorce and other personal missteps, Elizabeth Gilbert confronts the "twin goons" of depression and loneliness by traveling to three countries that she intuited had something she was seeking. First, in Italy, she seeks to master the art of pleasure by indulging her senses. Then, in an Indian ashram, she learns the rigors and liberation of mind-exalting hours of meditation. Her final destination is Bali, where she achieves a precarious, yet precious equilibrium. Gilbert's original voice and unforced wit lend an unpretentious air to her expansive spiritual journey.
</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Grace Lichtenstein</h3><p>The only thing wrong with this readable, funny memoir of a magazine writer's yearlong travels across the world in search of pleasure and balance is that it seems so much like a Jennifer Aniston movie.</p><h3>The New Yorker</h3><p>At the age of thirty-one, Gilbert moved with her husband to the suburbs of New York and began trying to get pregnant, only to realize that she wanted neither a child nor a husband. Three years later, after a protracted divorce, she embarked on a yearlong trip of recovery, with three main stops: Rome, for pleasure (mostly gustatory, with a special emphasis on gelato); an ashram outside of Mumbai, for spiritual searching; and Bali, for &ldquo;balancing.&rdquo; These destinations are all on the beaten track, but Gilbert&rsquo;s exuberance and her self-deprecating humor enliven the proceedings: recalling the first time she attempted to speak directly to God, she says, &ldquo;It was all I could do to stop myself from saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan of your work.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Gilbert (The Last American Man) grafts the structure of romantic  fiction upon the inquiries of reporting in this sprawling yet  methodical travelogue of soul-searching and self-discovery.  Plagued with despair after a nasty divorce, the author, in her  early 30s, divides a year equally among three dissimilar  countries, exploring her competing urges for earthly delights  and divine transcendence. First, pleasure: savoring Italy's  buffet of delights-the world's best pizza, free-flowing wine and  dashing conversation partners-Gilbert consumes la dolce vita as  spiritual succor. "I came to Italy pinched and thin," she  writes, but soon fills out in waist and soul. Then, prayer and  ascetic rigor: seeking communion with the divine at a sacred  ashram in India, Gilbert emulates the ways of yogis in grueling  hours of meditation, struggling to still her churning mind.  Finally, a balancing act in Bali, where Gilbert tries for  equipoise "betwixt and between" realms, studies with a merry  medicine man and plunges into a charged love affair. Sustaining  a chatty, conspiratorial tone, Gilbert fully engages readers in  the year's cultural and emotional tapestry-conveying rapture  with infectious brio, recalling anguish with touching candor-as  she details her exotic tableau with history, anecdote and  impression.

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>An interest in the human condition is the common thread that  ties together Gilbert's diverse body of work, ranging from a  collection of short stories (Pilgrim) to a novel discussing the  outdoor lifestyle of Eustace Conway (The Last American Man). In  her new work, she continues her exploration of the human psyche  through a very personal journey of self-discovery in three  countries: Italy, India, and Indonesia. In Italy, her first  escape, she devours the food and the melodic language with equal  gusto. In India, she decamps to an ashram to learn the intense  discipline prayer and spiritual pilgrimage require, in the  process revealing the depths to be found in reflection,  meditation, and historical teachings. In Indonesia, she  generates strong friendships and gains insight into homeopathic  medicines, healing, and the complexities of different cultures.  Throughout, she candidly shares her observations and emotions as  she grows from a woman shattered, lost, and confused to one  rejuvenated, confident, and in love. A probing, thoughtful title  with a free and easy style, this work seamlessly blends history  and travel for a very enjoyable read. Highly recommended.

</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>An unsuccessful attempt at a memoir from novelist and journalist Gilbert (The Last American Man, 2002, etc.). While weeping one night on the bathroom floor because her marriage was falling apart, the author had a profound spiritual experience, crying out to and hearing an answer of sorts from God. Eventually, Gilbert left her husband, threw herself headlong into an intense affair, then lapsed into as intense a depression when the affair ended. After all that drama, we get to the heart of this book, a year of travel during which the author was determined to discover peace and pleasure. In Rome, she practiced Italian and ate scrumptious food. Realizing that she needed to work on her "boundary issues," she determined to forego the pleasure of sex with Italian men. In India, she studied at the ashram of her spiritual guru (to whom she had been introduced by the ex-lover), practiced yoga and learned that in addition to those pesky difficulties with boundaries, she also had "control issues." Finally she headed to Bali, where she became the disciple of a medicine man, befriended a single mother and fell in love with another expat. Quirky supporting characters pop up here and there, speaking a combination of wisdom and cliche. At the ashram, for example, she meets a Texan who offers such improbable aphorisms as, "You gotta stop wearing your wishbone where your backbone oughtta be." Gilbert's divorce and subsequent depression, which she summarizes in about 35 pages, are in fact more interesting than her year of travel. The author's writing is prosaic, sometimes embarrassingly so: "I'm putting this happiness in a bank somewhere, not merely FDIC protected but guarded by my four spiritbrothers."Lacks the sparkle of her fiction.

1. Gilbert writes that "the appreciation of pleasure can be the anchor of humanity," making the argument that America is "an entertainment-seeking nation, not necessarily a pleasure-seeking one." Is this a fair assessment? <p>
2. After imagining a petition to God for divorce, an exhausted Gilbert answers her phone to news that her husband has finally signed. During a moment of quietude before a Roman fountain, she opens her Louise Gl�ck collection to a verse about a fountain, one reminiscent of the Balinese medicine man's drawing. After struggling to master a 182-verse daily prayer, she succeeds by focusing on her nephew, who suddenly is free from nightmares. Do these incidents of fortuitous timing signal fate? Cosmic unity? Coincidence? <p>
3. Gilbert hashes out internal debates in a notebook, a place where she can argue with her inner demons and remind herself about the constancy of self-love. When an inner monologue becomes a literal conversation between a divided self, is this a sign of last resort or of self-reliance? <p>
4. When Gilbert finally returns to Bali and seeks out the medicine man who foretold her return to study with him, he doesn't recognize her. Despite her despair, she persists in her attempts to spark his memory, eventually succeeding. How much of the success of Gilbert's journey do you attribute to persistence? <p>
5. Prayer and meditation are both things that can be learned and, importantly, improved. In India, Gilbert learns a stoic, ascetic meditation technique. In Bali, she learns an approach based on smiling. Do you think the two can be synergistic? Or is Ketut Liyer right when he describes them as "same-same"? <p> 
6. Gender roles come up repeatedly in <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>, be it macho Italian men eating cream puffs after a home team's soccer loss, or a young Indian's disdain for the marriage she will be expected to embark upon at age eighteen, or the Balinese healer's sly approach to male impotence in a society where women are assumed responsible for their childlessness. How relevant is Gilbert's gender? <p>
7. In what ways is spiritual success similar to other forms of success? How is it different? Can they be so fundamentally different that they're not comparable? <p>
8. Do you think people are more open to new experiences when they travel? And why? <p>
9. Abstinence in Italy seems extreme, but necessary, for a woman who has repeatedly moved from one man's arms to another's. After all, it's only after Gilbert has found herself that she can share herself fully in love. What does this say about her earlier relationships? <p>
10. Gilbert mentions her ease at making friends, regardless of where she is. At one point at the ashram, she realizes that she is too sociable and decides to embark on a period of silence, to become the Quiet Girl in the Back of the Temple. It is just after making this decision that she is assigned the role of ashram key hostess. What does this say about honing one's nature rather than trying to escape it? Do you think perceived faults can be transformed into strengths rather than merely repressed? <p>
10. Sitting in an outdoor caf� in Rome, Gilbert's friend declares that every city-and every person-has a word. Rome's is "sex," the Vatican's "power"; Gilbert declares New York's to be "achieve," but only later stumbles upon her own word, antevasin, Sanskrit for "one who lives at the border." What is your word? Is it possible to choose a word that retains its truth for a lifetime?

<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><html><body> <h1><font size="+3"> Eat, Pray, Love </font></h1><hr noshade size="1"><font size="+1"><b> By Elizabeth Gilbert </b></font></hr><h4><b> Viking Adult </b></h4><font size=-1><b> ISBN&#58; 0-670-03471-1 </b></font><br><hr noshade size='1'></hr> <br><h3> Chapter One </h3> I wish Giovanni would kiss me. <p> Oh, but there are so many reasons why this would be a terrible idea. To begin with, Giovanni is ten years younger than I am, and-like most Italian guys in their twenties-he still lives with his mother. These facts alone make him an unlikely romantic partner for me, given that I am a professional American woman in my mid-thirties, who has just come through a failed marriage and a devastating, interminable divorce, followed immediately by a passionate love affair that ended in sickening heartbreak. This loss upon loss has left me feeling sad and brittle and about seven thousand years old. Purely as a matter of principle I wouldn't inflict my sorry, busted-up old self on the lovely, unsullied Giovanni. Not to mention that I have finally arrived at that age where a woman starts to question whether the wisest way to get over the loss of one beautiful brown-eyed young man is indeed to promptly invite another one into her bed. This is why I have been alone for many months now. This is why, in fact, I have decided to spend this entire year in celibacy. <p> To which the savvy observer might inquire&#58; "Then why did you come to Italy?" <p> To which I can only reply-especially when looking across the table at handsome Giovanni-"Excellent question." <p> Giovanni is my Tandem Exchange Partner. That sounds like an innuendo, but unfortunately it's not. All it really means is that we meeta few evenings a week here in Rome to practice each other's languages. We speak first in Italian, and he is patient with me; then we speak in English, and I am patient with him. I discovered Giovanni a few weeks after I'd arrived in Rome, thanks to that big Internet cafe at the Piazza Barbarini, across the street from that fountain with the sculpture of that sexy merman blowing into his conch shell. He (Giovanni, that is-not the merman) had posted a flier on the bulletin board explaining that a native Italian speaker was seeking a native English speaker for conversational language practice. Right beside his appeal was another flier with the same request, word-for-word identical in every way, right down to the typeface. The only difference was the contact information. One flier listed an e-mail address for somebody named Giovanni; the other introduced somebody named Dario. But even the home phone number was the same. <p> Using my keen intuitive powers, I e-mailed both men at the same time, asking in Italian, "Are you perhaps brothers?" <p> It was Giovanni who wrote back this very provocativo message&#58; "Even better. Twins!" <p> Yes-much better. Tall, dark and handsome identical twenty-five-year-old twins, as it turned out, with those giant brown liquid-center Italian eyes that just unstitch me. After meeting the boys in person, I began to wonder if perhaps I should adjust my rule somewhat about remaining celibate this year. For instance, perhaps I could remain totally celibate except for keeping a pair of handsome twenty-five-year-old Italian twin brothers as lovers. Which was slightly reminiscent of a friend of mine who is vegetarian except for bacon, but nonetheless ... I was already composing my letter to Penthouse&#58; <p> In the flickering, candlelit shadows of the Roman cafe, it was impossible to tell whose hands were caress-But, no. <p> No and no. <p> I chopped the fantasy off in mid-word. This was not my moment to be seeking romance and (as day follows night) to further complicate my already knotty life. This was my moment to look for the kind of healing and peace that can only come from solitude. <p> Anyway, by now, by the middle of November, the shy, studious Giovanni and I have become dear buddies. As for Dario-the more razzle-dazzle swinger brother of the two-I have introduced him to my adorable little Swedish friend Sofie, and how they've been sharing their evenings in Rome is another kind of Tandem Exchange altogether. But Giovanni and I, we only talk. Well, we eat and we talk. We have been eating and talking for many pleasant weeks now, sharing pizzas and gentle grammatical corrections, and tonight has been no exception. A lovely evening of new idioms and fresh mozzarella. <p> Now it is midnight and foggy, and Giovanni is walking me home to my apartment through these back streets of Rome, which meander organically around the ancient buildings like bayou streams snaking around shadowy clumps of cypress groves. Now we are at my door. We face each other. He gives me a warm hug. This is an improvement; for the first few weeks, he would only shake my hand. I think if I were to stay in Italy for another three years, he might actually get up the juice to kiss me. On the other hand, he might just kiss me right now, tonight, right here by my door ... there's still a chance ... I mean we're pressed up against each other's bodies beneath this moonlight ... and of course it would be a terrible mistake ... but it's still such a wonderful possibility that he might actually do it right now ... that he might just bend down ... and ... and ... Nope. <p> He separates himself from the embrace. <p> "Good night, my dear Liz," he says. <p> "Buona notte, caro mio," I reply. <p> I walk up the stairs to my fourth-floor apartment, all alone. I let myself into my tiny little studio, all alone. I shut the door behind me. Another solitary bedtime in Rome. Another long night's sleep ahead of me, with nobody and nothing in my bed except a pile of Italian phrasebooks and dictionaries. <p> I am alone, I am all alone, I am completely alone. <p> Grasping this reality, I let go of my bag, drop to my knees and press my forehead against the floor. There, I offer up to the universe a fervent prayer of thanks. <p> First in English. <p> Then in Italian. <p> And then-just to get the point across-in Sanskrit. <p> <p> <h3> Chapter Two </h3> And since I am already down there in supplication on the floor, let me hold that position as I reach back in time three years earlier to the moment when this entire story began-a moment which also found me in this exact same posture&#58; on my knees, on a floor, praying. <p> Everything else about the three-years-ago scene was different, though. That time, I was not in Rome but in the upstairs bathroom of the big house in the suburbs of New York which I'd recently purchased with my husband. It was a cold November, around three o'clock in the morning. My husband was sleeping in our bed. I was hiding in the bathroom for something like the forty-seventh consecutive night, and-just as during all those nights before-I was sobbing. Sobbing so hard, in fact, that a great lake of tears and snot was spreading before me on the bathroom tiles, a veritable Lake Inferior (if you will) of all my shame and fear and confusion and grief. <p> I don't want to be married anymore. <p> I was trying so hard not to know this, but the truth kept insisting itself to me. <p> I don't want to be married anymore. I don't want to live in this big house. I don't want to have a baby. <p> But I was supposed to want to have a baby. I was thirty-one years old. My husband and I-who had been together for eight years, married for six-had built our entire life around the common expectation that, after passing the doddering old age of thirty, I would want to settle down and have children. By then, we mutually anticipated, I would have grown weary of traveling and would be happy to live in a big, busy household full of children and homemade quilts, with a garden in the backyard and a cozy stew bubbling on the stovetop. (The fact that this was a fairly accurate portrait of my own mother is a quick indicator of how difficult it once was for me to tell the difference between myself and the powerful woman who had raised me.) But I didn't-as I was appalled to be finding out-want any of these things. Instead, as my twenties had come to a close, that deadline of THIRTY had loomed over me like a death sentence, and I discovered that I did not want to be pregnant. I kept waiting to want to have a baby, but it didn't happen. And I know what it feels like to want something, believe me. I well know what desire feels like. But it wasn't there. Moreover, I couldn't stop thinking about what my sister had said to me once, as she was breast-feeding her firstborn&#58; "Having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face. You really need to be certain it's what you want before you commit." <p> How could I turn back now, though? Everything was in place. This was supposed to be the year. In fact, we'd been trying to get pregnant for a few months already. But nothing had happened (aside from the fact that-in an almost sarcastic mockery of pregnancy-I was experiencing psychosomatic morning sickness, nervously throwing up my breakfast every day). And every month when I got my period I would find myself whispering furtively in the bathroom&#58; Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me one more month to live ... I'd been attempting to convince myself that this was normal. All women must feel this way when they're trying to get pregnant, I'd decided. ("Ambivalent" was the word I used, avoiding the much more accurate description&#58; "utterly consumed with dread".) I was trying to convince myself that my feelings were customary, despite all evidence to the contrary-such as the acquaintance I'd run into last week who'd just discovered that she was pregnant for the first time, after spending two years and a king's ransom in fertility treatments. She was ecstatic. She had wanted to be a mother forever, she told me. She admitted she'd been secretly buying baby clothes for years and hiding them under the bed, where her husband wouldn't find them. I saw the joy in her face and I recognized it. This was the exact joy my own face had radiated last spring, the day I discovered that the magazine I worked for was going to send me on assignment to New Zealand, to write an article about the search for giant squid. And I thought, "Until I can feel as ecstatic about having a baby as I felt about going to New Zealand to search for a giant squid, I cannot have a baby" <p> I don't want to be married anymore. <p> In daylight hours, I refused that thought, but at night it would consume me. What a catastrophe. How could I be such a criminal jerk as to proceed this deep into a marriage, only to leave it? We'd only just bought this house a year ago. Hadn't I wanted this nice house? Hadn't I loved it? So why was I haunting its halls every night now, howling like Medea? Wasn't I proud of all we'd accumulated-the prestigious home in the Hudson Valley, the apartment in Manhattan, the eight phone lines, the friends and the picnics and the parties, the weekends spent roaming the aisles of some box-shaped superstore of our choice, buying ever more appliances on credit? I had actively participated in every moment of the creation of this life-so why did I feel like none of it resembled me? Why did I feel so overwhelmed with duty, tired of being the primary breadwinner and the housekeeper and the social coordinator and the dog-walker and the wife and the soon-to-be mother, and-somewhere in my stolen moments-a writer ...? <p> I don't want to be married anymore. <p> My husband was sleeping in the other room, in our bed. I equal parts loved him and could not stand him. I couldn't wake him to share in my distress-what would be the point? He'd already been watching me fall apart for months now, watching me behave like a madwoman (we both agreed on that word), and I only exhausted him. We both knew there was something wrong with me, and he'd been losing patience with it. We'd been fighting and crying, and we were weary in that way that only a couple whose marriage is collapsing can be weary. We had the eyes of refugees. <p> The many reasons I didn't want to be this man's wife anymore are too personal and too sad to share here. Much of it had to do with my problems, but a good portion of our troubles were related to his issues, as well. That's only natural; there are always two figures in a marriage, after all-two votes, two opinions, two conflicting sets of decisions, desires and limitations. But I don't think it's appropriate for me to discuss his issues in my book. Nor would I ask anyone to believe that I am capable of reporting an unbiased version of our story, and therefore the chronicle of our marriage's failure will remain untold here. I also will not discuss here all the reasons why I did still want to be his wife, or all his wonderfulness, or why I loved him and why I had married him and why I was unable to imagine life without him. I won't open any of that. Let it be sufficient to say that, on this night, he was still my lighthouse and my albatross in equal measure. The only thing more unthinkable than leaving was staying; the only thing more impossible than staying was leaving. I didn't want to destroy anything or anybody. I just wanted to slip quietly out the back door, without causing any fuss or consequences, and then not stop running until I reached Greenland. <p> This part of my story is not a happy one, I know. But I share it here because something was about to occur on that bathroom floor that would change forever the progression of my life-almost like one of those crazy astronomical super-events when a planet flips over in outer space for no reason whatsoever, and its molten core shifts, relocating its poles and altering its shape radically, such that the whole mass of the planet suddenly becomes oblong instead of spherical. Something like that. <p> What happened was that I started to pray. <p> You know-like, to God. <p> <p> <h3> Chapter Three </h3> Now, this was a first for me. And since this is the first time I have introduced that loaded word-GOD-into my book, and since this is a word which will appear many times again throughout these pages, it seems only fair that I pause here for a moment to explain exactly what I mean when I say that word, just so people can decide right away how offended they need to get. <p> Saving for later the argument about whether God exists at all (no-here's a better idea&#58; let's skip that argument completely), let me first explain why I use the word God, when I could just as easily use the words Jehovah, Allah, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu or Zeus. Alternatively, I could call God "That", which is how the ancient Sanskrit scriptures say it, and which I think comes close to the all-inclusive and unspeakable entity I have sometimes experienced. But that "That" feels impersonal to me-a thing, not a being-and I myself cannot pray to a That. I need a proper name, in order to fully sense a personal attendance. For this same reason, when I pray, I do not address my prayers to The Universe, The Great Void, The Force, The Supreme Self, The Whole, The Creator, The Light, The Higher Power, or even the most poetic manifestation of God's name, taken, I believe, from the Gnostic gospels&#58; "The Shadow of the Turning". <p> I have nothing against any of these terms. I feel they are all equal because they are all equally adequate and inadequate descriptions of the indescribable. But we each do need a functional name for this indescribability, and "God" is the name that feels the most warm to me, so that's what I use. I should also confess that I generally refer to God as "Him", which doesn't bother me because, to my mind, it's just a convenient personalizing pronoun, not a precise anatomical description or a cause for revolution. Of course, I don't mind if people call God "Her", and I understand the urge to do so. Again-to me, these are both equal terms, equally adequate and inadequate. Though I do think the capitalization of either pronoun is a nice touch, a small politeness in the presence of the divine. <p> Culturally, though not theologically, I'm a Christian. I was born a Protestant of the white Anglo-Saxon persuasion. And while I do love that great teacher of peace who was called Jesus, and while I do reserve the right to ask myself in certain trying situations what indeed He would do, I can't swallow that one fixed rule of Christianity insisting that Christ is the only path to God. Strictly speaking, then, I cannot call myself a Christian. Most of the Christians I know accept my feelings on this with grace and open-mindedness. Then again, most of the Christians I know don't speak very strictly. To those who do speak (and think) strictly, all I can do here is offer my regrets for any hurt feelings and now excuse myself from their business. <p> Traditionally, I have responded to the transcendent mystics of all religions. I have always responded with breathless excitement to anyone who has ever said that God does not live in a dogmatic scripture or in a distant throne in the sky, but instead abides very close to us indeed-much closer than we can imagine, breathing right through our own hearts. I respond with gratitude to anyone who has ever voyaged to the center of that heart, and who has then returned to the world with a report for the rest of us that God is an experience of supreme love. In every religious tradition on earth, there have always been mystical saints and transcendents who report exactly this experience. Unfortunately many of them have ended up arrested and killed. Still, I think very highly of them. <p> <i>(Continues...)</i> <p> <p> </i></b></blockquote> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Eat, Pray, Love</b> by <b>Elizabeth Gilbert</b> Excerpted by permission.<br> All rights reserved.
