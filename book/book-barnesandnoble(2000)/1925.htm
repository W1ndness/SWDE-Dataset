			Bargain</li></ul></div></div><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>Kate Hollis&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s face plasters newsstands and TV, the Internet, and the multiplex. Jake Sharpe is one of the biggest recording stars on the planet, and every song he&rsquo;s famous for is about Kate. For over a decade his soundtrack has chased her - from the gym to the supermarket, from the dentist&rsquo;s office to the bars. Now thirty-year-old Kate gets the call that Jake has finally landed back in their Vermont hometown for an MTV special. The moment she has been waiting for has arrived.<br><br>On the eve of their prom, Jake Sharpe vanished, resurfacing when his song &ldquo;Losing&rdquo; - about his and Kate&rsquo;s first sexual experience - shot to the top of the Billboard charts. And the hits kept coming, each more personal than the one before. <br><br>Now Kate gets her chance to confront Jake and reclaim her past. But after eleven years of enduring protracted and far-from-private heartbreak, everyone in Kate&rsquo;s life has a stake in how this plays out. Kate must risk betraying the friends Jake abandoned, the bandmates whose songs he plundered, and her own parents, who fear this will dredge up a shared past more painful than any of them want to acknowledge. But after getting the call in the dead of night and jumping on a plane, can she turn back now?<br><br>Newsweek dubbed The Nanny Diaries &ldquo;a national phenomenon&rdquo; and the New Republic proclaimed, &ldquo;Thank God for Citizen Girl.&rdquo; Now McLaughlin and Kraus have written a poignant, humorous tale about modern celebrity obsession and coming of age during the divorce boom. With flawless depictions of the 1980s, a charismatic heroine, and their signature biting wit, the authors offer up another lively and hilarious tale of a smart young woman looking for satisfaction in the chaos of contemporary culture.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>The team behind <I>The Nanny Diaries</I>and <I>Citizen Girl</I>returns with another breezy chick lit portrayal of a woman wronged and, eventually, empowered. When Kate Hollis's childhood chum Laura calls from their Vermont hometown and announces the arrival of Jake Sharpe, a mega rock star and Kate's high school sweetheart, Kate jumps on a plane from Charleston, S.C. (where she's a sustainable development consultant) and makes for idyllic Croton Falls. Through it's been 13 years, Kate still has a primal need to confront not only the boy who abandoned her before the senior prom, but the musical pirate who used her personal life as fodder for his most celebrated songs and cheated his high school bandmates out of deserved recognition and royalties. Chapters switch back and forth between the present and the pivotal middle and high school years where Kate (then Katie) and Jake did the first-love thing: readers get to see Jake's growing he's-just-not-that-into-you-ness and how (surprise!) their Zima-fueled love (it was the '90s) was idealized. While one spends much of the book wanting to shout at Kate to give it up, go back to Charleston and get on with it, McLaughlin and Kraus do get the nagging need for closure in even the shallowest relationships comically right. <I>(June)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information

											Kate Hollis has just gotten the call she's been waiting for years to get.  Her ex-boyfriend, Jake Sharpe, has just returned to their hometown.  Yes, Jake Sharpe.  The Jake Sharpe who's a mega-rockstar.  The Jake Sharpe who was her high school boyfriend and who broke her heart when he disappeared on her right before prom night.  The Jake Sharpe who has made fame and fortune detailing their sexual relationship and all of Kate's family issues in his songs.  Now it's payback time.<p/><p/>McLaughlin and Kraus tell this story by alternating between the 18 year old Kate and the 30 year old one.  Kate is now an accomplished professional, but still haunted by the betrayals Jake has done.  She has maintained a close relationship with her best friend in high school, and comes home to confront Jake when her friend calls with the news that he has hit town.  Even her parents worry about what the result of such a confrontation will be, but Kate is determined.  She feels that she can't move on until this issue from her past is resolved.<p/><p/>Lovers of &quot;chick lit&quot; will love this book.  It is written in a light and breezy style, with twists and turns in the plot.  I think it would be incredibly difficult to write a book with someone, and I wondered if they had split the writing with one author doing the 18 year old Kate and the other the adult one.  If they did, it wasn't possible to tell as the book flowed easily between the two eras.  This book is recommended for readers looking for an enjoyable read and those interested in how women resolve life issues.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Slow Start<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=of-course">of-course</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1349070_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781615537716_BK_1_1349070" href="#previewReview_1349070" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>April 04, 2010: 
											The story starts out slow and is made tedious by the authors writing style. Though they do have you wondering from the beginning what could Jake have done that was so bad.  The second half of the book, the story picks up, as you discover the gist of the problem.  I have a feeling a lot of people won't like the ending, but I thought it was exactly right for the way the authors developed and wrote the characters.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/38490000/38491726.JPG" alt="" height="87" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Emma McLaughlin & Nicola Kraus</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>New York, New York</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>McLaughlin: Elmira, New York; Kraus: New York, New York</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A., Gallatin School of Individualized Study, NYU (McLaughlin, 1996; Kraus, 1995)</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>When Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus met, they were both students at New York University and both working as part-time nannies for families on the Upper East Side. (Kraus was a native of the city; McLaughlin was from upstate New York.)   <p>  They didn't dream then that the shared experience that cemented their friendship would lead to fame and fortune as the authors of <I>The Nanny Diaries</I>, a fictional account of their years working in childcare.  <p>  "We wrote it for ourselves, really," McLaughlin told a reporter from <I>The Washington Post</I>. "We wrote it to share with our parents and our close friends. And we wrote it to see if we could."  <p>  The result was a scathing portrait of emotionally unavailable parents who obsess over private school admissions but coolly deflect the kids' hands when they come in search of a hug. <I>The New York Times'</I> Janet Maslin called it "perfectly pitched social satire."  <p>  And it struck a nerve with readers -- not only in New York City, but across the country and around the world. More than 2 million copies have been printed, and rights to the book were purchased in 32 countries.  <p>  "It was unbelievable to us," Kraus said in an interview with <I>Rocky Mountain News</I>. "I don't think we ever wrapped our heads around it."   <p>  At the age of 28, the two were celebrity writers, able to devote themselves full-time to the task of co-authoring another novel. First, though, there were some hurdles to clear: their publishers at St. Martin's Press didn't want their second book, so a new agent got them a two-book deal at Random House. But the deal fizzled, and their much-publicized $2 million advance was rescinded.  <p>  Finally, they landed at Atria Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, which published <I>Citizen Girl</I>, another satirical take on a young New Yorker's travails in the work world -- this time, a woman in her twenties who is fired from her feminist nonprofit and lands a new job at a dot-com.   <p>  "We set out to write something we had not come across," McLaughlin told <I>Rocky Mountain News</I>. "And we had not come across a book that takes a young woman through a professional odyssey, where the odyssey is 99 percent of the experience and her sex life is 1 percent of it."   <p>  The phenomenally successful <I>Nanny Diaries</I> was a tough act to follow, and some critics found the new book disappointing. <I>USA Today</I> suggested that the authorial duo might be a "one-hit wonder."  <p>  But other reviewers were positively buoyant about <I>Citizen Girl</I> and the way its heroine struggles to hang onto her integrity, self-respect and feminism in a world of "Girls Gone Wild."  <p>  "Thank God for <I>Citizen Girl</I>," wrote Sacha Zimmerman in <I>The New Republic</I>. "Girl is a self-possessed, moral, intelligent, and open feminist who is not a militant-chic refugee from Lilith Fair or an NPR-tote-bag carrying blue-stater in a hemp dress. She isn't a loveable oaf like Bridget Jones who only obsesses over weight and boys and little else. McLaughlin and Kraus pull it off because they are so wry and so spot on."  <p>  McLaughlin and Kraus insist they aren't joined at the hip -- but they are good partners, and fans can expect their partnership to continue. "With any luck," wrote Emily Gordon for <I>Newsday</I>, "even if their next collaboration is a book about the pitfalls of creating a sane but beautiful wedding, the trials of loft buying or the stresses of professional pregnancy, they'll do it with panache."  <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>A few fun outtakes from our interview with McLaughlin and Kraus</I>: <p>    <b>"We love</b> our dogs." <p>    <b>"We can't write something we don't feel passionate about</b> -- we tried, it doesn't work." <p>    <b>"Eddie Izzard's comedy show</b>, <I>Dressed to Kill</I>, is our crack. Whenever the writing gets too stuck, we take a breather and fire him up." <p>    <b>"While we spend an inordinate amount of time together</b> and it may frequently feel like we are, we are actually <I>not</I> a) living together, b) married to each other, or c) otherwise joined at the hip. Luckily, our own homes and lives allow us a few moments of daily rest to restore and revive before we head back into the writing cave." <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the winter of 2004, Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus took some time out to talk with us about some of their favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  <b>Emma McLaughlin:</b><br>  Life Influence: Read at a time when everything feels intense, seminal, and like you're the first person to discover it, freshman year of college, Carol Gilligan's <I>In a Different Voice</I> made my hair stand on end with awe. She introduced me to a completely different lens for looking at identity and put forth a productive language with which to deconstruct gender. Her work set my college studies on fire in the best possible way. <p>    Career Influence: Read on a miserable family vacation in your early 20s when you're too old to share a motel room with the cousins and too poor to afford your own escape -- David Sedaris' <I>SantaLand Diaries</I>, quickly followed by <I>Naked</I>, brought me a clinical amount of joy. In retrospect, it was the pivotal "ah-ha!" He flipped the light switch on the tremendous humor and politics to be explored in the rarely mined professional landscape, for which I will be eternally grateful.  <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <b>Nicola Kraus:</b><br>  Well, I have realized in attempting to list these books that my response to a good story is highly visceral and challenging to quantify. Often what remains in my memory are the emotions the story evoked, rather than an autopsy of its compelling qualities; so noted, here are my impressions:<p>    <li><I>Atonement</I> by Ian McEwan -- I developed such a deep affection for the characters in the first few chapters of the story and then I remember having this horrible moment where it dawned on me that this couldn't just be a beautifully written tale of compelling characters having a nice day in the country, and I suddenly became sick at the thought of anything horrible befalling any of them. Near the end I had to put the book in the freezer. After a few days I retrieved it. I remember finishing it on the Acela train on the way home from D.C. It was a tremendous effort not to sob audibly. <p>    <li><I>The End of Alice</I> by A. M. Homes -- As sparingly dark as this book is, it remains one of my favorites, even though I had to read through the night to have it over with as fast as possible. It is an absolute tour de force and I recommend it heartily to anyone who can tolerate climbing inside the absolute nadir of what the human animal is capable of. <p>    <li><I>I Know This Much Is True</I> by Wally Lamb -- Not only exquisitely written but one of the most suspenseful and compelling books I've ever read. Although it's almost 1,000 pages long, I finished it in three days. It's a thought-provoking, moving exploration of the expectations our culture places on men. And I remember how devastated I was when I finished it and how much I envy anyone who still has the treat of experiencing it to look forward to. <p>    <li>The Regeneration Trilogy by Pat Barker -- These three novels are about Craiglockheart, the first hospital to treat shell-shock during World War I. The fiction jumps off from the factual premise that Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon were both patients there at the same time. I love British books set during the wars, but this trilogy is at the top of my list for the way it captures the aftermath of combat and the profound consequences to an English society filled for the first time with the living dead.  <p>    <li><I>Survivor</I> by Chuck Pahlahniuk -- Every time I read one of his books I am always in awe at his extraordinary use of language, his ability to infuse eviscerating dark humor with subtle, yet crucial, heart and his skill for gripping the reader with unplug-the-phone suspense -- he is a master storyteller.  <p>    <b>McLaughlin:</b><br>  <li><I>Naked</I> by David Sedaris -- See above.<p>    <li><I>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</I> by Dave Eggers -- Because it is. And hands down, the best Acknowledgements section ever written.<p>    <li><I>The Virgin Suicides</I> by Jeffrey Eugenides -- An utterly innovative construct that calls up a suburban summer so viscerally you can hear the crickets chirping.<p>    <li><I>Straight Man</I> by Richard Russo.  A pitch-perfect take on much-traversed territory, this book rang utterly true to my academically employed family.  <p>    <li><I>A Thousand Acres</I> by Jane Smiley -- Before novels written by women were relegated to their own "genre," I was introduced to Jane Smiley by a dear professor who raised my awareness of what female authors were bringing to the table of contemporary fiction. Shakespeare with a woman's soul, far beyond simply "re-setting," Smiley executes an innovative approach with precision and heart. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <b>Kraus:</b><br>  <li><I>The English Patient</I> -- I've seen it 11 times. It is heartbreaking. Swoon.  <p>    <li><I>Naked</I> by Mike Leigh -- I love stories with a Hamlet-esque, tortured antihero out of step with society. It's dark with a little more dark and a side of dark.  <p>    <li><I>If Lucy Fell</I> -- Hands-down my favorite contemporary romantic comedy of all time. <p>    <b>McLaughlin:</b><br>  <li><I>Jerry Maguire</I> -- The ultimate working film. Cameron Crowe can write dialogue and shoot it with warmth and humor like nobody else. <p>    <li><I>Broadcast News</I> -- The other ultimate working film. I simply love every second of this movie.  <p>    <li><I>The Insider</I> -- The other <I>other</I> ultimate working film. Michael Mann infuses a symphony into the very real stomach-turning choices one can be faced with as an employee. His storytelling tautly holds the universal tension that we all can't help but identify deeply with our work. <p>    <li><I>Lost in Translation</I> -- A news flash demanding answers as to why there aren't more than, um, two women allowed to write and direct in the big Hollywood system. Utterly gorgeous and genius. I mean come on -- Sofia Coppola creates a masterpiece about a <I>state of mind</I>! You sit down and come up with a compelling story about jet lag.<p>      <li><I>Monsters, Inc.</I> -- Pixar just plain makes me happy, but this one is a particularly smart concept, constructing a loving yet feasible reason behind why monsters need to be "scary." Smart, smart, smart. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  <b>Kraus:</b><br>  I always listen to music when I write, usually instrumental soundtracks, like <I>High Heels</I>, <I>The Lover</I>, <I>Talk to Her</I>. Or else songs that I'm so familiar with that I no longer hear the lyrics and the language won't distract me. Music can be an invaluable tool for conjuring a mood. <p>    <b>McLaughlin:</b><br>  I am just the opposite. I can't listen to anything when I write, not even the TV. I do have to listen to music when I drive, though. Short drives: dance stuff I can bop along to. Long drives: the somewhat modern musical (early '70s forward), in particular Sondheim. As a novelist, I find it mind-blowing that people take the story even further, out into this thematic, harmonic realm. From a painting to <I>Sunday in the Park with George</I> -- it's so inspiring that hours of road fly by. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  <b>Kraus:</b><br>  <I>Anna Karenina</I> by Leo Tolstoy -- I've never read it (shame, I know) and if I had a deadline I'd finally pull my socks up and take it on.  <p>    <b>McLaughlin:</b><br>  Sadly, I share the shame. I think we're onto something, though -- the Guilt Book Club! I'll bring <I>Crime and Punishment</I>! <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  <b>Kraus:</b><br>  I don't have a favorite <I>type</I> of book to get, but I love getting books, especially when the person has read the book already themselves. Then, while I'm reading, I feel as if I'm visiting a place my friend has been before me. And I enjoy discovering why the book brought me to mind. I think of whoever gave it to me as the story unfolds and, the best part, I can talk about it with them when I'm done. <p>    <b>McLaughlin:</b><br>  I agree. Also, when I find something I love I push it like a drug dealer -- I gave <I>Naked</I> to everybody for every occasion for a year straight.  <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  <b>Kraus:</b><br>  I have to have everything neat and tidy to start -- it's a little OCD. And if things shift around while Emma and I are brainstorming, I'll reach around her to put everything back at right angles.  Snacks are also crucial. And also knowing when to get up and get some fresh air; sometimes stepping away gets the brain unstuck.  <p>    <b>McLaughlin:</b><br>  I have to walk around a lot. I used to think it was procrastination, but I've learned that I just have to work and work at an idea or scene before I sit down to write, and then it just comes rolling out. The upside is I have a much cleaner house when we're in "generating" mode. <p>    <b>What are you working on now?</b><br>  <b>McLaughlin & Kraus:</b><br>  We are writing a screenplay to give ourselves a break before our next novel. It's enormously challenging, and we're greatly enjoying flexing different mental muscles.  <p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be?</b><br>  <b>McLaughlin & Kraus:</b><br>  Allison McGhee. She was our pick for the <I>Today</I> show's book club. She is an extraordinary writer. Her stories are that delicious and rare blend of warmth, humor, exquisite imagery and lightening pacing. We recommend all her novels, especially <I>Was It Beautiful?</I> and <I>Shadow Baby</I>.  <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  <b>McLaughlin & Kraus:</b><br>  Look in the acknowledgments of books you enjoyed that you feel are similar in some way to your own manuscript. Then send your manuscript to the editor and agent listed, with a letter mentioning how much you enjoyed the other book they worked on and why you think your manuscript is comparable and should be published. This way you know you're approaching people who have a similar sensibility to you and are much more likely to be responsive to your work. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>Kate Hollis&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s face plasters newsstands and TV, the Internet, and the multiplex. Jake Sharpe is one of the biggest recording stars on the planet, and every song he&rsquo;s famous for is about Kate. For over a decade his soundtrack has chased her - from the gym to the supermarket, from the dentist&rsquo;s office to the bars.

But after eleven years of enduring protracted and far-from-private heartbreak, everyone in Kate&rsquo;s life has a stake in how this plays out. Kate must risk betraying the friends Jake abandoned, the bandmates whose songs he plundered, and her own parents, who fear this will dredge up a shared past more painful than any of them want to acknowledge. But after getting the call in the dead of night and jumping on a plane, can she turn back now?<br><br>Newsweek dubbed The Nanny Diaries &ldquo;a national phenomenon&rdquo; and the New Republic proclaimed, &ldquo;Thank God for Citizen Girl.&rdquo; Now McLaughlin and Kraus have written a poignant, humorous tale about modern celebrity obsession and coming of age during the divorce boom. With flawless depictions of the 1980s, a charismatic heroine, and their signature biting wit, the authors offer up another lively and hilarious tale of a smart young woman looking for satisfaction in the chaos of contemporary culture.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>The team behind <I>The Nanny Diaries</I>and <I>Citizen Girl</I>returns with another breezy chick lit portrayal of a woman wronged and, eventually, empowered. When Kate Hollis's childhood chum Laura calls from their Vermont hometown and announces the arrival of Jake Sharpe, a mega rock star and Kate's high school sweetheart, Kate jumps on a plane from Charleston, S.C. (where she's a sustainable development consultant) and makes for idyllic Croton Falls. Through it's been 13 years, Kate still has a primal need to confront not only the boy who abandoned her before the senior prom, but the musical pirate who used her personal life as fodder for his most celebrated songs and cheated his high school bandmates out of deserved recognition and royalties. Chapters switch back and forth between the present and the pivotal middle and high school years where Kate (then Katie) and Jake did the first-love thing: readers get to see Jake's growing he's-just-not-that-into-you-ness and how (surprise!) their Zima-fueled love (it was the '90s) was idealized. While one spends much of the book wanting to shout at Kate to give it up, go back to Charleston and get on with it, McLaughlin and Kraus do get the nagging need for closure in even the shallowest relationships comically right. <I>(June)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>The film version of McLaughlin and Kraus's first novel, <i>The Nanny Diaries</i>, opens April 20; now comes their well-timed third novel. So far, the duo has exposed the underground world of New York nannies and satirized corporate America. What's left? How about a statement on celebrity culture and obsession? Enter 30-year-old Kate Hollis, a successful career woman who can't seem to shake her high school boyfriend. Why? The ex-boyfriend is Jake Sharpe, America's hottest musician, and his every no. 1 hit is a commentary on Kate and their relationship. When Jake shows up in their hometown after having abruptly left 13 years ago, right before the senior prom, Kate, too, comes home, finally confronting her ex and moving on with her life. Alternating between the present showdown and Kate and Jake's junior high and high school years (complete with an exhausting amount of early Nineties trivia), the story is implausible, and Jake never seems worth all the fuss. However, if the Nanny Diaries movie is as successful as the book was, every public library should have this new work on the shelf. [See Prepub Alert, <i>LJ</i>2/15/07.]</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Kate's boyfriend disappeared two days before the senior prom,  then resurfaced as a rock star whose songs were always about  her. Now he's back in town. From the team that gave us The Nanny  Diaries; with a five-city tour.   Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A young woman gets the chance to confront the now world-famous rock star who broke her heart 13 years ago, and who went on to write a series of deeply personal songs about her. Back in Croton Falls, Vt., Jake Sharpe was a teen dream: beautiful, talented, with an aching vulnerability and an unhappy home life. After adoring him for much of high school, Kate Hollis finally gets her man, and the two are inseparable until Jake takes off for L.A. shortly before graduation-without saying goodbye. A devastated Kate tries to get over her loss, but finds it exceedingly difficult as Jake's music career takes off, with his songs about their young love becoming modern classics. So when her childhood best friend Laura calls to alert her that Jake has come home to do a TV special, Kate puts her grown-up life in Charleston on hold and heads to Croton Falls, in an effort to make Jake "regret his entire existence." At her parent's house, Kate revisits all the memories, good and bad, that led her to this moment, including her dad's mental breakdown and her mom's subsequent affair, which brought Kate and Jake even closer. And, yep, he wrote about that, too. She then schemes her way onto Jake's shoot, and catches his eye, setting the stage for the apology-and sexy reunion-that Kate has long been waiting for. Turns out that Jake has never gotten over her either, and the rekindling of their romance feels like fate, with Jake trying to make up for lost time. He whisks his muse to his New York penthouse, and the two share some blissful moments until the mayhem of his celebrity existence intrudes, causing Kate to question whether Jake has changed too much-or too little. This third effort from McLaughlin and Kraus(Citizen Girl, 2004, etc.) is spot-on in its depiction of Kate and Laura's early girlish hysteria, and quickly overcomes a certain cleverness for its own sake to tell a moving story of teenage passion. Bittersweet coming-of-age tale with flashes of wit and an especially sympathetic heroine.

I ask into the phone, disoriented, voice sandy with sleep. <P>"Kate." <P>"Yeah," I murmur, my head sinking, pushing the receiver deeper into the pillow. <P>"He's here," she repeats. "In Croton." <P>Her words register and my eyes fly open. I sit up.<P>"Awake now?" she asks. <P>"Yes." I look over to my bedside table, tilting up straighter to see over the stack of books. The glowing numbers on the clock read 4&#58;43 a.m. "How &#151; " <P>"Mick's been throwing up &#151; some kind of stomach flu slash candy cane binge with the baby-sitter. I look out the bathroom window and his mother's house is lit up like Disney World, called the sheriff's office and they confirmed it. He's here. He's here, Kate." <P>I fling off the duvet. "I'm coming." Dropping the cordless into its metallic stand, I swing both feet to the smooth wood floor of my bedroom. <P>He's here &#151; there. Jake Sharpe. Of course it's not three P.M. ona Saturday. Of course you reappear in the middle of the night like somenocturnal blood-leech. <P>Adrenaline surges. I grab yoga pants from the chair, pull them up under my nightslip, and tug the little black cardigan from the doorknob. Throwing open the closet doors, I stand on tiptoe, fingernails catching the edge of my suitcase handle just enough to avalanche it off the shelf, business trip toiletries raining on my head and rolling across the hardwood. I scramble to retrieve the miniature bottles, an anxiety-dream sweat dampening the silk of my slip. Only I'm awake. And Laura's flare finally hovers in the night sky overthe snowy hills of our hometown. <P>Indignation fuels the whipping open of drawers, fistfuls ofunderwear, T-shirts, and pajamas filling the case, my mind moving ahead to the important items &#151; skinny jeans, date sweater, dangly earrings &#151; the heels that knock me up to five-nine. The two zipper toggles collide and I shove my brass travel lock through the holes.<P>Rolling down the hall I push my feet into my sneakers, yank my trench from its hook, open the front door to the cricket quiet of my suburban street, and reach into my pocket for the keys &#151; shit, my purse. I whirl in the dark apartment, spotting it hiding on the kitchen table among the boxes of unwritten Christmas cards, rolls of wrapping paper, and my laptop. No. I don't need my laptop. Just bring the binder to read on the plane. Then I might start the report. Then I might need my laptop. Just bring the laptop. I try to unclip it from the docking station, but my fingers fumble. I flick the light switch on, startled by the jarring brightness. But, oh, this is good, yes, okay, good, light helps. Okay, reality check. I take in my reflection in the kitchen window, face creased from sleep, eyes puffed from deprivation of same, brown hair tangled from passing out in forgotten ponytail holder. <P>This is insane. <P>I flick the light back off, swing the front door shut, stalk back to thebedroom, flop on top of the bed, and pull the still-warm duvet over melike a taco. Letting the keys drop from my grip, I will the adrenalineaway, will back the peaceful dead-to-the-world repose I was beneath justmoments ago. <P>Sleep, Kate. Go back...to sleep. You've been working nonstop &#151; the conference, the meetings, the forty-two-hour round-trip to Argentina. This bed was all you could think of. Aren't you comfortable? And relaxed? Living your life? Sleeping in your bed? Isn't it nice to be an adult...who can get into her own bed...in her own apartment...and go to sleep...on her own timing. My pulse deepens. And not be reduced to some stupid...knee-jerk...adolescent...obsessive...lunatic behavior...just because Jake's finally shown up &#151; finally shown up &#151; <P>I sit up. Breathless. <P>And within minutes find myself flying along Route 26, counting off the exits to the Charleston airport.<P>I pull the suitcase from the backseat and lock the Prius with a doublebeep, glancing up once again at the LONG-TERM PARKING sign. I ignore theimplications. This is a swing through, that's all. An eight-hundred-mileswing through. <P>The sky still black behind me, I pass between the sliding glass doors into a brick-walled trough of canned air and canned music. The lone ticket agent, wearing three-step eyes and impressively pronounced lipstick for predawn, smiles in greeting. "Checking in?" she asks. I blink at the crimson foil poinsettia pinned to her uniform. "Checking in?" she repeats. <P>"Yes?" I answer uncertainly. <P>She looks at me inquisitively as I look at her inquisitively. "Are you sure?" <P>"Yes. Yes. I'm going to Croton Falls, Vermont. Burlington is closest, but I'll take whatever you have." I drop my purse on the counter and rest my messengerbag heavy with my laptop between my ankles. <P>"Can I see your I.D.?" I flip open my wallet and slide the plastic over. <P>She looks down at the card with a frown. "Solutions for Sustainability?" <P>"Sorry." I trade her my office badge for my license. <P>"And ticket?" <P>"Actually I don't have one, but I need to get on the first flight. What do you have?" <P>She taps the keyboard, and I watch her stare intently at the obscured screen, all the possible routes back to him. "Well, let's see, there is one seat left on the commuter to Atlanta, then a two-hour layover, which would get you into LaGuardia by three and then another layover..." <P>"Is that really the earliest I can get there?" I lift my wheelie onto the metalscale. <P>She tears the outdated baggage tag from the handle. "Two days before Christmas &#151; yes." <P>"Right. Great. Thank you." <P>"If the weather cooperates you should be in Burlington by six P.M." Almost twelve hours from now. Rock on. <P>I take my ticket, with its two layovers and one leg in cargo, and make my way to the gate, wishing for a Starbucks, but settling for a man selling the bare basics from a brown Formica cart.<P>Slinging my messenger bag into the overhead bin I take my seat in row thirteen with a bruised banana and large black coffee. I nestle against the plastic wallpaper and let my hair down from its makeshift topknot, my lids drooping shut, blocking out the sensation of everyone settling in around me.<P>"Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has informed us we may be hittingsome turbulence, so we will be turning the seat belt sign back on.Please make sure that they are fastened." I reflexively open my eyes todouble-check that I'm still buckled in beneath my neglected binder onArgentina's revised pollution regulations. My gaze locks with theheadline of my seatmate's US Weekly. "First photos ever! Jake Sharpe andEden Millay spotted ring shopping in St. Bart's. Is it WEDDING BELLS?"We hit an air pocket and the plane drops, my stomach lurching.<P>"Ladies and gentlemen, we're now beginning our descent." Twisting the opening of my bag toward me with my foot to keep it level, I pray those aren't prescient words. <P>I peer out the window for some visual landmark to orient me &#151; a landing strip, the distant lights of Burlington, but the blackness seems thick and impermeable. Then the clouds clear the full moon, the snow-covered fields suddenly gleaming as if lit by a flashbulb. I rub my eyes as the wheels touch down.<P>A chapped-cheeked luggage handler emerges through the plastic flaps from the tarmac, pulling the laden metal cart behind him, trailing tread marks of sleet on the tile. He deposits its contents before us, and immediately there's a flurry of grabbing hands, the snapping of handles extending, as my fellow passengers take what's theirs and go. I stare for a moment in disbelief at the empty steel trolly. Shit. "Sir?" I make a beeline to where the man is checking off arriving flights on a clipboard. "Is that all the bags?" <P>"Sorry, ma'am, there're baggage delays coming out of New York. If yours isn't there, check with Velma at the desk. She can help you fill out a report." <P>I drop my head. "Thank you." <P>As Velma and I fill out the forms she repeatedly promises with a big smile that they will bring my little rolling bag to my door the minute it arrives in Burlington, the minute. Only, she concludes brusquely, as she taps the layers of forms neatly back together on the countertop, it's Christmas and she can't make any promises. I nod, heaving my bags back onto my shoulder, the realization sinking in that I'm going to be trying to make someone regret his entire existence in yoga pants. I walk to the sliding glass doors and &#151; ohfuckohfuckohfuck &#151; run through the snowdrifts in my sneakers to the fewwaiting taxis, their mufflers steaming.

"My cousin's in Fayville &#151; with the Christmas traffic, thatcould be an hour, easy." <P>"I know." I let my bags slide off my shoulder onto the torn vinyl seat. "I'll pay your return fare."

I ask into the phone, disoriented, voice sandy with sleep. <P><P>"Kate." <P><P>"Yeah," I murmur, my head sinking, pushing the receiver deeper into the pillow. <P><P>"He's here," she repeats. "In Croton." <P><P>Her words register and my eyes fly open. I sit up.<P><P>"Awake now?" she asks. <P><P>"Yes." I look over to my bedside table, tilting up straighter to see over the <P>stack of books. The glowing numbers on the clock read 4:43 a.m. "How -- " <P><P>"Mick's been throwing up -- some kind of stomach flu slash candy cane binge <P>with the baby-sitter. I look out the bathroom window and his mother's house <P>is lit up like Disney World, called the sheriff's office and they confirmed it. <P>He's here. He's here, Kate." <P><P>I fling off the duvet. "I'm coming." Dropping the cordless into its metallic <P>stand, I swing both feet to the smooth wood floor of my bedroom. <P><P>He's here -- there. Jake Sharpe. Of course it's not three P.M. on<P>a Saturday. Of course you reappear in the middle of the night like some<P>nocturnal blood-leech. <P><P>Adrenaline surges. I grab yoga pants from the chair, pull them up under my <P>nightslip, and tug the little black cardigan from the doorknob. Throwing open <P>the closet doors, I stand on tiptoe, fingernails catching the edgeof my <P>suitcase handle just enough to avalanche it off the shelf, business trip <P>toiletries raining on my head and rolling across the hardwood. I scramble to <P>retrieve the miniature bottles, an anxiety-dream sweat dampening the silk of <P>my slip. Only I'm awake. And Laura's flare finally hovers in the night sky over<P>the snowy hills of our hometown. <P><P>Indignation fuels the whipping open of drawers, fistfuls of underwear, <P>T-shirts, and pajamas filling the case, my mind moving ahead to the important <P>items -- skinny jeans, date sweater, dangly earrings -- the heels that knock me <P>up to five-nine. The two zipper toggles collide and I shove my brass travel <P>lock through the holes.<P><P>Rolling down the hall I push my feet into my sneakers, yank my trench from its <P>hook, open the front door to the cricket quiet of my suburban street, and reach <P>into my pocket for the keys -- shit, my purse. I whirl in the dark apartment, <P>spotting it hiding on the kitchen table among the boxes of unwritten Christmas <P>cards, rolls of wrapping paper, and my laptop. No. I don't need my laptop. Just <P>bring the binder to read on the plane. Then I might start the report. Then I <P>might need my laptop. Just bring the laptop. I try to unclip it from the <P>docking station, but my fingers fumble. I flick the light switch on, startled <P>by the jarring brightness. But, oh, this is good, yes, okay, good, light helps. <P>Okay, reality check. I take in my reflection in the kitchen window, face <P>creased from sleep, eyes puffed from deprivation of same, brown hair tangled <P>from passing out in forgotten ponytail holder. <P><P>This is insane. <P><P>I flick the light back off, swing the front door shut, stalk back to the<P>bedroom, flop on top of the bed, and pull the still-warm duvet over me<P>like a taco. Letting the keys drop from my grip, I will the adrenaline<P>away, will back the peaceful dead-to-the-world repose I was beneath just<P>moments ago. <P><P>Sleep, Kate. Go back...to sleep. You've been working nonstop -- the conference, <P>the meetings, the forty-two-hour round-trip to Argentina. This bed was all you <P>could think of. Aren't you comfortable? And relaxed? Living your life? Sleeping <P>in your bed? Isn't it nice to be an adult...who can get into her own bed...in <P>her own apartment...and go to sleep...on her own timing. My pulse deepens. <P>And not be reduced to some stupid...knee-jerk...adolescent...obsessive...<P>lunatic behavior...just because Jake's finally shown up -- finally shown up --  <P><P>I sit up. Breathless. <P><P>And within minutes find myself flying along Route 26, counting off the exits <P>to the Charleston airport.<P><P><P>I pull the suitcase from the backseat and lock the Prius with a double<P>beep, glancing up once again at the LONG-TERM PARKING sign. I ignore the<P>implications. This is a swing through, that's all. An eight-hundred-mile<P>swing through. <P><P>The sky still black behind me, I pass between the sliding glass doors into a <P>brick-walled trough of canned air and canned music. The lone ticket agent, <P>wearing three-step eyes and impressively pronounced lipstick for predawn, <P>smiles in greeting. "Checking in?" she asks. I blink at the crimson foil <P>poinsettia pinned to her uniform. "Checking in?" she repeats. <P><P>"Yes?" I answer uncertainly. <P><P>She looks at me inquisitively as I look at her inquisitively. "Are you sure?" <P><P>"Yes. Yes. I'm going to Croton Falls, Vermont. Burlington is closest, but I'll <P>take whatever you have." I drop my purse on the counter and rest my messenger<P>bag heavy with my laptop between my ankles. <P><P>"Can I see your I.D.?" <P>I flip open my wallet and slide the plastic over. <P><P>She looks down at the card with a frown. "Solutions for Sustainability?" <P><P>"Sorry." I trade her my office badge for my license. <P><P>"And ticket?" <P><P>"Actually I don't have one, but I need to get on the first flight. What do you <P>have?" <P><P>She taps the keyboard, and I watch her stare intently at the obscured screen, <P>all the possible routes back to him. "Well, let's see, there is one seat left <P>on the commuter to Atlanta, then a two-hour layover, which would get you into <P>LaGuardia by three and then another layover..." <P><P>"Is that really the earliest I can get there?" I lift my wheelie onto the metal<P>scale. <P><P>She tears the outdated baggage tag from the handle. "Two days before <P>Christmas -- yes." <P><P>"Right. Great. Thank you." <P><P>"If the weather cooperates you should be in Burlington by six P.M." Almost <P>twelve hours from now. Rock on. <P><P>I take my ticket, with its two layovers and one leg in cargo, and make my way <P>to the gate, wishing for a Starbucks, but settling for a man selling the bare <P>basics from a brown Formica cart.<P><P>Slinging my messenger bag into the overhead bin I take my seat in row thirteen <P>with a bruised banana and large black coffee. I nestle against the plastic <P>wallpaper and let my hair down from its makeshift topknot, my lids drooping <P>shut, blocking out the sensation of everyone settling in around me.<P><P>"Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has informed us we may be hitting<P>some turbulence, so we will be turning the seat belt sign back on.<P>Please make sure that they are fastened." I reflexively open my eyes to<P>double-check that I'm still buckled in beneath my neglected binder on<P>Argentina's revised pollution regulations. My gaze locks with the<P>headline of my seatmate's US Weekly. "First photos ever! Jake Sharpe and<P>Eden Millay spotted ring shopping in St. Bart's. Is it WEDDING BELLS?"<P>We hit an air pocket and the plane drops, my stomach lurching.<P><P><P>"Ladies and gentlemen, we're now beginning our descent." Twisting the opening <P>of my bag toward me with my foot to keep it level, I pray those aren't <P>prescient words. <P><P>I peer out the window for some visual landmark to orient me -- a landing strip, <P>the distant lights of Burlington, but the blackness seems thick and <P>impermeable. Then the clouds clear the full moon, the snow-covered fields <P>suddenly gleaming as if lit by a flashbulb. I rub my eyes as the wheels touch <P>down.<P><P><P>A chapped-cheeked luggage handler emerges through the plastic flaps from the <P>tarmac, pulling the laden metal cart behind him, trailing tread marks of sleet <P>on the tile. He deposits its contents before us, and immediately there's a <P>flurry of grabbing hands, the snapping of handles extending, as my fellow <P>passengers take what's theirs and go. I stare for a moment in disbelief at the <P>empty steel trolly. Shit. "Sir?" I make a beeline to where the man is checking <P>off arriving flights on a clipboard. "Is that all the bags?" <P><P>"Sorry, ma'am, there're baggage delays coming out of New York. If yours isn't <P>there, check with Velma at the desk. She can help you fill out a report." <P><P>I drop my head. "Thank you." <P><P>As Velma and I fill out the forms she repeatedly promises with a big smile <P>that they will bring my little rolling bag to my door the minute it arrives <P>in Burlington, the minute. Only, she concludes brusquely, as she taps the <P>layers of forms neatly back together on the countertop, it's Christmas and <P>she can't make any promises. I nod, heaving my bags back onto my shoulder, <P>the realization sinking in that I'm going to be trying to make someone regret <P>his entire existence in yoga pants. I walk to the sliding glass doors and -- <P>ohfuckohfuckohfuck -- run through the snowdrifts in my sneakers to the few<P>waiting taxis, their mufflers steaming. I slam the door shut behind me with a <P>rusty squeak. "Hi, I'm going to Croton Falls, please." <P><P>"Croton!" the driver coughs, resting the cigarette on his lip to shift the car<P>into drive.
