You can usually find me either at home or at the public library, where I work. I've lived in this town all my life and raised two daughters here. But my husband and I - well, about six months ago, he disappeared. Just&hellip;disappeared. Where's Dan? Why did he go? Who's he with? Will I ever find out?<br> <br>My hometown, my family and friends, bring me comfort during this difficult time. Comfort and a sense of shelter. I'm continually reminded that life can and does go on. For instance, everyone's been discussing weddings and babies lately. Justine - the only daughter of my best friend, Olivia Lockhart - impulsively got married a little while ago. My own daughter Kelly recently had a baby. Unfortunately, she refuses to accept that Dan might not return to see his first grandchild. My older daughter, Maryellen, is more realistic. I think she's seeing a new man, but for some reason she won't tell me who it is.<br><br>Then there's Jack, who's been pursuing a romance with Olivia, and his son, Eric, and Eric's girlfriend, Shelly (I think she's pregnant), and Zach and Rosemary Cox, whose marriage is reputedly on the skids and&hellip;Well, just come on over and we'll talk!<br><br>Grace</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Life goes on in the small coastal town of Cedar Cove, Wash., as  real life does everywhere with small dramas and personal  epiphanies in this sedate slice-of-life drama. The last time  readers visited Cedar Cove in Macomber's 16 Lighthouse Road,  family court judge Olivia Lockhart had refused to grant a  divorce to a young couple trying to come to terms with the loss  of their infant daughter. This time around, Olivia has problems  of her own; her ex-husband wants her back, which makes her  on-again, off-again relationship with newspaper editor Jack  Griffin even rockier. Elsewhere around town, Olivia's daughter  finally follows her heart and marries her high school sweetheart  instead of the troublemaking older man she'd been dating; Zach  and Rose Cox find their marriage falling apart when Rosie begins  neglecting her family for volunteer work; and Maryellen Sherman,  the manager of the local art gallery, becomes pregnant after a  brief affair with an artist. Despite all these goings-on, the  book's main focus is librarian Grace Sherman, whose husband of  35 years is still missing after disappearing six months earlier.  The first few chapters, in which Macomber reacquaints readers  with the town and its occupants, may feel sluggish to those  familiar with the series, but this smooth yet simplistic  offering will claim the reader's attention once the  introductions are over.

When Macomber decided to follow her dreams of becoming a bestselling novelist, she had a lot of obstacles in her path. For starters, Macomber is dyslexic. On top of this, she had only a high school degree, four young children at home, and absolutely no connections in the publishing world. If there's one thing you can say about Debbie Macomber, however, it is that she does not give up. She rented a typewriter and started writing, determined to break into the world of romance fiction.   <P>The years went on and the rejection letters piled up. Her family was living on a shoestring budget, and Debbie was beginning to think that her dreams of being a novelist might never be fulfilled. She began writing for magazines to earn some extra money, and she eventually saved up enough to attend a romance writer's conference with three hundred other aspiring novelists. The organizers of the conference picked ten manuscripts to review in a group critique session. Debbie was thrilled to learn that her manuscript would be one of the novels discussed.   <P>Her excitement quickly faded when an editor from Harlequin tore her manuscript to pieces in front of the crowded room, evoking peals of laughter from the assembled writers. Afterwards, Macomber approached the editor and asked her what she could do to improve her novel. "Throw it away," the editor suggested.   <P>Many writers would have given up right then and there, but not Macomber. The deeply religious Macomber took a lesson from Job and gathered strength from adversity. She returned home and mailed one last manuscript to Silhouette, a publisher of romance novels. "It cost $10 to mail it off," Macomber told the <I>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</I> in 2000. "My husband was out of work at this time, in Alaska, trying to find a job. The children and I were living on his $250-a-week unemployment, and I can't tell you what $10 was to us at that time."   <P>It turned out to be the best $10 Macomber ever spent. In 1984, Silhouette published her novel, <I>Heartsong</I>. (Incidentally, although <I>Heartsong</I>  was Macomber's first sale, she actually published another book, <I>Starlight</I>, before <I>Heartsong</I> went to print.) <I>Heartsong</I> went on to become the first romance novel to ever be reviewed in <I>Publishers Weekly</I>, and Macomber was finally on her way.  <P>Today, Macomber is one of the most widely read authors in America. A regular on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller charts,  she is best known for her Cedar Cove novels, a heartwarming story sequence set in a small town in Washington state, and for her Knitting Books series, featuring a group of women who patronize a Seattle yarn store. In addition, her backlist of early romances, including several contemporary Westerns, has been reissued with great success.  <P>Macomber has made a successful transition from conventional romance to the somewhat more flexible genre known as "women's fiction." "I was at a point in my life where I found it difficult to identify with a 25-year-old heroine," Macomber said in an interview with ContemporaryRomanceWriters.com. "I found that I wanted to write more about the friendships women share with each other." To judge from her avid, ever-increasing fan base, Debbie's readers heartily approve.</P></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some outtakes from our interview with Macomber:</I> <p>  <b>"I'm dyslexic, although they didn't have a word for it</b> when I was in grade school. The teachers said I had 'word blindness.' I've always been a creative speller and never achieved good grades in school. I graduated from high school but didn't have the opportunity to attend college, so I did what young women my age did at the time -- I married. I was a teenager, and Wayne and I (now married nearly 37 years) had four children in five years."<p>    <b>"I'm a yarnaholic. That means I have more yarn stashed away</b> than any one person could possibly use in three or four lifetimes. There's something inspiring about yarn that makes me feel I could never have enough. Often I'll go into my yarn room (yes, room!) and just hold skeins of yarn and dream about projects. It's a comforting thing to do."<p>    <b>"My office walls are covered with autographs of famous writers</b> -- it's what my children call my �dead author wall.' I have signatures from Mark Twain, Earnest Hemingway, Jack London, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Pearl Buck, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, to name a few."  <p>     <b>"I'm morning person, and rip into the day with a half-mile swim</b> (FYI: a half mile is a whole lot farther in the water than it is on land) at the local pool before I head into the office, arriving before eight. It takes me until nine or ten to read through all of the guest book entries from my web site and the mail before I go upstairs to the turret where I do my writing. Yes, I write in a turret -- is that romantic, or what? I started blogging last September and really enjoy sharing bits and pieces of my life with my readers. Once I'm home for the day, I cook dinner, trying out new recipes. Along with cooking, I also enjoy eating, especially when the meal is accompanied by a glass of good wine. Wayne and I take particular pleasure in sampling eastern Washington State wines (since we were both born and raised in that part of the state). <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the spring of 2005, Debbie Macomber took some time out to answer our questions.</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  The one book that has had the strongest influence on my life, without question, is the Bible. God's Word has been the guiding force behind all I do. I read the Bible each and every day and gain inspiration, encouragement, and joy.  <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  Before I answer this, I feel it's necessary to mention that I read widely, across the board.  In compiling this list I discovered several of my favorite books are nonfiction. I have not noted the Bible a second time, although as I indicated above, it is the most influential book in my life. <p>    <li><I>Charms for the Easy Life</I> by Kaye Gibbons -- For its charm, its wonderful writing, and its truth. (I introduced this book to my editor, who now loves Kaye Gibbons's work as much as I do.) <p>    <li><I>And Then There Was Light</I> by Jacques Lusseyran -- I read this book shortly after learning that my father had been a POW in WWII, something he never talked about until the end of his life. It helped me understand some of what he endured and gave me a deep appreciation of the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation. <p>    <li><I>The Power of Positive Thinking</I> by Norman Vincent Peale -- When I first decided to write, I knew I was going to need all the positive reinforcement I could get. I read and reread Dr. Peale's wonderful words of wisdom. After I published my first book, I wrote Dr. Peale to thank him for his inspiration, and he wrote me back. It is a letter I will always treasure. <p>    <li><I>The Wolf and the Dove</I> by Kathleen E.  Woodiwiss -- I loved and read this historical romance so often that I had the first page nearly memorized. Kathleen Woodiwiss opened my eyes to the possibilities of fiction. These characters felt real to me. I cheered and cried with them and never wanted the book to end. I first read this book in the early 1980s and knew from that moment on that I wanted my readers to feel the same way when they finished one of my books.   <p>    <li><I>Why Good Girls Don't Get Ahead but Gutsy Girls Do</I> by Kate White -- This business-related book taught me that I'm a gutsy girl in a good-girl disguise. It offers some of the soundest career advice I've read. <p>    <li><I>The 21 Immutable Laws of Marketing</I> by Al Ries and Jack Trout -- Another wonderful business book that is  full of interesting tidbits about the buying public, their buying habits and how best to market to them. <p>    <li><I>The Notorious Rake</I> by Mary Balogh -- I'm a real fan of Regency romances, and I consider this one of the best.  I read this book in one sitting, unable to put it down. <p>    <li><I>The 13th Juror</I> by John Lescroart -- This is one of the best-plotted and most interesting books I've read in ages, and I have recommended it again and again. John is a wonderful writer, and we discovered that we have a great deal in common, including the fact that both our fathers were POWs in WWII. <p>    <li><I>If Ever I Return, Pretty Peggy-O</I> by Sharyn McCrumb -- My editor recommended this author to me and commented that she envied me the experience of reading my first Sharyn McCrumb. (This book is the first of her Ballad series, all set in Appalachia.) Later I was fortunate enough to meet Sharyn at a writers' conference, so I could tell her how much I enjoyed her work. <p>    <li><I>Walking After Midnight</I> by Karen Robards -- This book was pure fun. I felt as though I was on a roller-coaster ride, and every page was a thrill.  <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  I'm a big film buff, although I'm not fond of movies with excessive violence. I've always enjoyed musicals. My first exposure was with <I>West Side Story</I>. I memorized all the songs and belted them out for months afterward. I almost entered the convent after watching <I>The Sound of Music</I>. Thankfully, I didn't; it wouldn't have been a good fit for either of us. In recent years I've enjoyed <I>The Princess Bride</I> and the <I>Star Wars</I> series. I like movies with what I call a zinger -- <I>Collateral</I> and <i>The Replacement Killers</I> are good examples. And comedies, too.  I don't think I've ever laughed so hard as when I watched <I>The Gods Must Be Crazy</I>, <I>It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World</I>, and <I>The Hallelujah Trail</I>. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I don't listen to music while writing. It's not that I need silence in order to create. I started out writing when our four children were small and I needed to keep my ears tuned to them in case one of them decided to play Superman and fly out a window or start a campfire in the middle of the living room. When it comes to listening to the radio, I prefer the oldies stations. When I'm on the treadmill, I play Christian CDs and make a joyful noise. Correction: It's a joyful noise to me, but I doubt others would think so.  <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  There's a bookstore directly below my office. It's hard to believe but I write above a bookstore <I>and</I> an ice cream parlor. This, my friends, is a writer's nirvana. On average I buy a book a day, and that's no exaggeration. Mostly I purchase nonfiction for gifts. One of my favorites is <I>Gifts from the Sea</I> by Anne Morrow Lindberg. For my writer friends I've bought <I>Goals</I> by Brian Tracy, and for friends who are animal lovers I've bought <I>The Dog Who Rescues Cats</I> by Gonzalez & Fleischer. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have a cherrywood desk with a glass top to protect the wood. Over the years a number of things have made their way under the glass. There's a picture of my dad and his brother, who looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for identical twins -- only my dad was a full foot shorter than his brother. Then there are pictures of my grandchildren (by far the cutest grandkids in the universe), and there's a slip of paper on which I've written four words. They are:  "provocative," "relevant," "creative," and "honest." When I decide on a plot for one of my big hardcover stories, I weigh the story against each of these words. I want to provoke my readers to think. I want the story to be relevant to them and to our times. My goal is to tell this story in as creative a way as possible and to be honest with my readers and with myself. As you might have guessed, I'm a lover of words. As for rituals, I really don't have any.  <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  In my humble opinion, there are a lot of writers out there who haven't suffered enough. I suffered plenty. When I first started writing, I didn't know another writer in the world. This was back in the late 1970s before Romance Writers of America was formed. For nearly five years I wrote and submitted my manuscripts. My work was rejected so fast it practically hit me in the back of the head on my way home from the post office. At one point in my lonely sojourn, an editor read and reviewed my manuscript, and with the utmost sincerity told me there was no use in revising it and the best thing I could do was <I>throw it away</I>. Thankfully, I didn't take her advice, because that <I>same</I> manuscript sold to a rival publishing house and launched my writing career. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I would suggest that writers pay close attention to the market -- read the bestsellers, analyze each story and look for the key element that is drawing an audience. Who would ever have imagined that <I>Life of Pi</I> by Yann Martel would command the audience it has? Or <I>The Da Vinci Code</I>? As writers, it's important we not <I>follow</I> trends but observe and understand life -- and start our own. It was when I saw a lot of angel figurines turning up in catalogs that I wrote the first Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy Christmas book.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>Grace Sherman<br>204 Rosewood Lane Cedar Cove, Washington<br><br>Dear Listener,<br>If you've been to Cedar Cove before we've probably met. You can usually find me either at home or at the public library, where I work. I've lived in this town all my life and raised two daughters here. But my husband and I - well, about six months ago, he disappeared. Just&hellip;disappeared. Where's Dan? Why did he go? Who's he with? Will I ever find out?<br> <br>My hometown, my family and friends, bring me comfort during this difficult time. Comfort and a sense of shelter. I'm continually reminded that life can and does go on. For instance, everyone's been discussing weddings and babies lately. Justine - the only daughter of my best friend, Olivia Lockhart - impulsively got married a little while ago. My own daughter Kelly recently had a baby. Unfortunately, she refuses to accept that Dan might not return to see his first grandchild. My older daughter, Maryellen, is more realistic. I think she's seeing a new man, but for some reason she won't tell me who it is.<br><br>Then there's Jack, who's been pursuing a romance with Olivia, and his son, Eric, and Eric's girlfriend, Shelly (I think she's pregnant), and Zach and Rosemary Cox, whose marriage is reputedly on the skids and&hellip;Well, just come on over and we'll talk!<br><br>Grace</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Life goes on in the small coastal town of Cedar Cove, Wash., as  real life does everywhere with small dramas and personal  epiphanies in this sedate slice-of-life drama. The last time  readers visited Cedar Cove in Macomber's 16 Lighthouse Road,  family court judge Olivia Lockhart had refused to grant a  divorce to a young couple trying to come to terms with the loss  of their infant daughter. This time around, Olivia has problems  of her own; her ex-husband wants her back, which makes her  on-again, off-again relationship with newspaper editor Jack  Griffin even rockier. Elsewhere around town, Olivia's daughter  finally follows her heart and marries her high school sweetheart  instead of the troublemaking older man she'd been dating; Zach  and Rose Cox find their marriage falling apart when Rosie begins  neglecting her family for volunteer work; and Maryellen Sherman,  the manager of the local art gallery, becomes pregnant after a  brief affair with an artist. Despite all these goings-on, the  book's main focus is librarian Grace Sherman, whose husband of  35 years is still missing after disappearing six months earlier.  The first few chapters, in which Macomber reacquaints readers  with the town and its occupants, may feel sluggish to those  familiar with the series, but this smooth yet simplistic  offering will claim the reader's attention once the  introductions are over.

</div><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3>Grace Sherman stared down at the legal form that would start the divorce proceedings. She sat in the attorney's office with Maryellen, her oldest daughter, who'd come with her to offer support. Grace reminded herself that this should be straightforward, that her decision was made. She was ready to end her marriage, ready to piece together her shattered life. To begin again&hellip; But her hand shook as she picked up the pen.<P>The inescapable fact was that she didn't want this&mdash; but Dan hadn't left her with any other option.<P>Five months ago, in April, her husband of almost thirty-six years had disappeared. Vanished without a trace. One day everything was perfectly normal, and the next he was gone. Apparently by choice and without a word of explanation. Even now, Grace had difficulty believing that the man she'd lived with, the man she'd loved and with whom she'd had two daughters, could do anything as cruel as this.<P>If Dan had fallen out of love with her, she could accept that. She would've found enough pride, enough generosity, to release him without bitterness. If he was that miserable in their marriage, she would've gladly set him free to find happiness with someone else. What she couldn't forgive was the misery he'd heaped on their family's shoulders, what he'd done to their daughters. Especially Kelly.<P>Dan had disappeared shortly after Kelly and Paul had announced that after years of trying, they were finally excitedly, pregnant. Dan had been thrilled, and Grace, too. This baby was going to be their first grandchild. They'd waited so long.<P>Kelly had always been close to her father and his disappearance at this critical time in her life had devastated her. She'd pleaded with Grace to postpone the divorce proceedings, convinced that her father would return before Tyler was born. When Dan did return, he'd have a logical reason and would explain everything to their satisfaction.<P>He hadn't come back, though, and there'd been no further information. Nothing but doubts, questions and a churning, deepening anger that intensified in the endless weeks that followed.<P>When Grace couldn't stand not knowing any longer, she'd hired Roy McAfee, a private detective and former policeman she trusted. Roy had done an extensive search, certain that Dan had left a paper trail, and he'd been right. What Roy had uncovered was a complete shock to Grace. A year earlier, Dan had purchased a travel trailer, paying cash for it. Grace had no idea where he'd gotten that kind of money, nor did she know anything about the trailer. He'd never mentioned it, nor had she seen it. To this day she had no idea where he'd kept it all those months. Or where it was now.<P>Given the mounting evidence, she had her suspicions. Grace believed that Dan had used the travel trailer to sneak away with another woman. There'd been one sighting of him and it had come late in May. It almost felt as if her husband had orchestrated this brief reappearance, as if he was taunting her, challenging her to find him. That day had been a low point for Grace.<P>A co-worker of Dan's had spotted him at the marina and Maryellen had hurried to the library to fetch her. But by the time Grace reached the marina, Dan was gone. A woman had pulled up to the curb and Dan had climbed into the vehicle and driven away never to be seen or heard from again.<P>In retrospect, she'd come to believe that Dan was providing her with the answers she so desperately needed. She could think of no other reason he would mysteriously arrive at the busiest place in town, where he was most likely to be seen&mdash;and recognized. The library where she worked was less than two blocks away. Clearly, her husband lacked the courage to tell her there was someone else. Instead he'd chosen another, crueler way to inform her; he'd humiliated her in front of the entire community. Grace knew without being told that everyone in Cedar Cove pitied her.<P>That sighting had settled the matter in Grace's mind. Whatever love she still felt for Dan died that afternoon. Until then, she hadn't wanted to believe there was someone else. Even when the VISA bill showed up with a hefty charge from a local jeweler, Grace had refused to accept that her husband was involved with another woman. Dan just wasn't the kind of man who would be unfaithful to her. She'd trusted him. Not anymore.<P>&#34;Are you okay, Mom?&#34; Maryellen asked, touching her arm.<P>Grace's hand tightened around the pen. &#34;Fine,&#34; she snapped, instantly regretting her tone. She hadn't meant to sound so sharp.<P>Her daughter looked away. Grace focused on the divorce papers, hesitated a moment longer and then with haste signed her name.<P>&#34;I'll see that this is filed immediately,&#34; Mark Spell-man said.<P>Grace relaxed, leaning back in her chair. This was all there was to it? You could end a thirty-five-year marriage simply by signing your name? &#34;That's it?&#34;<P>&#34;Yes. Since you haven't heard from Daniel in five months, I don't foresee any legal complications. The divorce should be final in a few weeks.&#34;<P>Almost four decades tossed out the window like so much garbage. The good years, the bad years, the lean ones, the years they'd scrimped and saved. Like all couples, they'd had their share of problems, but despite everything they'd held their marriage together. Until now, until this&mdash;<P>&#34;Mom?&#34; Maryellen whispered.<P>Grace nodded abruptly, surprised at the emotion that choked her. She'd shed all the tears she intended to. In the months since Dan's disappearance, Grace had deeply grieved the loss of her marriage and the man she thought she knew. The truth of it was, she no longer had a choice; divorce had become inevitable. It was essential that she protect her financial interests. According to the attorney, she couldn't afford the luxury of doing nothing.<P>Her legal situation was one thing, and she'd dealt with that, but the emotional impact had left her badly shaken. Despite her resolve, the grief hadn't diminished. And the humiliation of what Dan had done was with her constantly. Everyone in town was aware of her circumstances and the fact that her husband had walked out on her.<P>Slowly Grace set the pen aside.<P>&#34;I'll wait to hear from you, then,&#34; she said to her attorney, rising out of the chair. Maryellen stood with her.<P>The attorney, a young man closer to Maryellen's age than her own, escorted them to the office door. He began to say something, then merely looked down and murmured a brief goodbye.<P>Outside his small home office, the sky had turned a depressing leaden gray. Grace felt a burden of sadness settle over her; she'd known this appointment wasn't going to be easy, but she hadn't expected it to exact such a toll on her self-confidence.<P>Maryellen glanced at her watch. &#34;I need to get back to the gallery.&#34;<P>&#34;I know,&#34; Grace said. Her daughter had offered to go to this appointment with her for moral support. Although she was grateful, Grace had thought it unnecessary. But Maryellen was right.<P>Her daughter was divorced, too. Maryellen had married young and unwisely, and the marriage had ended in less than a year. The experience had so biased her against men, she'd steered away from relationships ever since. Grace had tried to assure her that she'd meet a wonderful man someday, a man waiting for someone exactly like her. Maryellen had considered that naive and refused to listen and now Grace understood why. Divorce <I>hurt, </i>and it was the kind of vicious pain that reached deep inside a person.<P>Grace felt off balance and guilty, as though she had somehow failed. As though it was all her fault. Maryellen knew what it was like because she'd experienced these emotions herself when she was much younger and without the wisdom or perspective maturity brings.<P>&#34;Will you be all right?&#34; Maryellen asked, obviously reluctant to leave.<P>&#34;Of course,&#34; Grace said, forcing a smile. She ought to be feeling a measure of relief, after all. She'd finally taken action. She'd given Dan every opportunity, even issued a series of mental ultimatums and deadlines. He would come back when Kelly's baby was born. By the Fourth of July. By their wedding anniversary. First one, then another, until she faced the truth. He <I>wasn't </i>coming back. If she hadn't heard anything from him by now, she shouldn't expect that she ever would. Dan had no intention of being found.<P>&#34;Are you going back to work?&#34; Maryellen asked.<P>&#34;No,&#34; she said, refusing to allow herself to succumb to self-pity. &#34;I'm going to lunch.&#34;<P>&#34;Lunch? It's after four. You didn't eat earlier?&#34;<P>&#34;No.&#34; Grace didn't add that her appetite had been nonexistent for days as the appointment with the attorney grew closer. Then, because she knew her daughter was worried, she added emphatically, &#34;I <I>am </i>going to be all right, Maryellen.&#34;<P>Maryellen gazed down the steep hill toward the waterfront, where boats gently bobbed in the protected waters of the cove. Vehicles cruised down Harbor Street, so close together they looked like one continuous line. The Bremerton shipyard workers were out, and traffic filled the roads as husbands and fathers hurried home to their families. The same way Dan once had.<P>&#34;I'm so furious with Dad I don't know what I'd do if I ever saw him again,&#34; Maryellen said between gritted teeth.<P>Grace knew, though. She was convinced that Maryellen would be grateful, that she wouldn't care what he'd done as long as he came home. And Kelly, their youngest, would shout with joy and tell them all how wrong they'd been. She'd run to her father with open arms, eagerly awaiting the excuse that would explain everything.<P>&#34;I'm fine,&#34; Grace insisted. &#34;Really.&#34; Still Maryellen hesitated. &#34;I hate to leave you.&#34; &#34;I'll get over this.&#34; Although that was hardly the way she felt. But if Grace had learned anything in life, it was the importance of balance. For each loss, there were compensations, and she reminded herself to keep the good things firmly in sight. &#34;I have so much to be grateful for. You and Kelly, and now a grandson. I'm so sorry it had to end this way with your father and me, but I'm going to come back stronger than ever.&#34; Even as she said the words, Grace knew they were true. The sense of loss was profound, but balance would return to her life and so would joy.<P>It was Justine Gunderson's lunch break, and all she wanted to do was run home and check the mail. She hadn't heard from Seth in nearly a week. All right, five days, but each one of those days felt like a year. Her husband of little more than a month was in Alaska, fishing the crab-rich waters of the Bering Sea. Seth had warned her when she drove him to the airport that he'd be working sixteen-hour days. He'd assured her that he was crazy in love with her and would be back before she had time to miss him.<P>Seth had been wrong. Justine was miserable. They'd married, as the old western hit said, &#34;in a fever,&#34; unable to delay the wedding even one minute once they'd made the decision. Without telling either set of parents, they'd raced to Reno, gotten the license, found a preacher and afterward headed straight for a hotel room.<P>They were young and healthy and very much in love. Justine had known Seth nearly her entire life. He'd been her twin brother's best friend&mdash;until Jordan drowned at age thirteen. Justine and Seth had been in the same high-school graduating class. In the ten years that followed, he'd lived in Cedar Cove but they hadn't been in contact until recently, when they'd both reluctantly joined the committee planning their class reunion.<P>At the time, Justine had been dating Warren Saget, a local developer. Warren was quite a few years older than Justine; in fact, he was just a little younger than her own father. Warren liked having a beautiful woman on his arm and Justine suited him perfectly. It helped that she was willing to keep his little secret-while he might be successful in the boardroom, his powers didn't extend to the bedroom. When they were together, she often spent the night at his plush hillside house overlooking the cove, but that was more for show than anything. She had her own bedroom in Warren's home. Justine knew very well what people thought, but she'd never much cared.<P>However, her mother did. Olivia Lockhart shared the general assumptions about her arrangement with Warren and had plenty of opinions on the matter. Justine didn't enlighten her because it was none of Olivia's business. This disagreement between them had put a strain on the mother-daughter relationship. Her grandmother hadn't been particularly pleased, either, but Charlotte wasn't nearly as open in her disapproval. No doubt hoping to distract her from Warren, her mother had encouraged Justine to date Seth&mdash;although even Olivia had been shocked when Justine phoned to tell her she'd impulsively married him.<P>The marriage was practically as big a surprise toJus-tine as it was to her family. After a spat having to do with Warren, Seth had walked away from her. Justine couldn't let it end like that, not with Seth, and she'd gone to him, hoping to make amends. To say they'd settled their differences was something of an understatement.<P>After the wedding, they'd only had that one weekend before Seth had to return to Alaska. In the weeks since, she'd heard from him intermittently, but he couldn't call&mdash;or receive calls&mdash;while he was at sea, so their communications were few and far between.<P>Justine glanced at the time and tried to decide whether she should drive home and check the mail or not. If there was no letter, she'd feel depressed for the rest of the afternoon. On the other hand, if Seth did happen to send her a message, she'd be walking on clouds for days afterward. She needed a letter, a phone call, <I>anything </i>that would remind her she'd made the right choice in marrying him. Getting married was the only impulsive thing she'd ever done in all her twenty-eight years. She liked her life orderly and precise. The need for control had always ruled her choices&mdash;until she fell in love with Seth.<P>This commitment to order was one reason she fit in so well at First National Bank, rising quickly to the position of manager. Numbers made sense; they added up neatly; they were unambiguous. To the best of her ability that was the way Justine lived her life&mdash; with strong convictions and with exactness, leaving little room for frivolity and impulse.<P>Out of habit, she looked up when the bank's double glass doors swung open and watched as Warren Saget walked in, bold as could be. He moved directly toward her desk, his manner confident. Justine hadn't seen him since her impromptu wedding. Unfortunately they hadn't parted on the best of terms. Warren had been angry when he learned she'd married Seth and had made some ugly, spiteful remarks. Frankly Justine wasn't up for a second confrontation.<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><html><body><h1><font size="+3">204 Rosewood Lane</font></h1> <hr noshade size="1"><font size="+1"><b>By Debbie Macomber</b></font></hr> <h4><b>MIRA Books</b></h4> <font size=-1><b>Copyright &copy; 2002</b></font> <font size=-1><b>Debbie Macomber<br>All right reserved.</b></font><br> <font size=1><b>ISBN&#58;&nbsp;1551669293</b></font><br> <hr noshade size='1'></hr> <!--exerpt--> <br><p>Grace Sherman stared down at the legal form that would start the divorce proceedings. She sat in the attorney's office with Maryellen, her oldest daughter, who'd come with her to offer support. Grace reminded herself that this should be straightforward, that her decision was made. She was ready to end her marriage, ready to piece together her shattered life. To begin again... But her hand shook as she picked up the pen.<p>The inescapable fact was that she didn't want this-but Dan hadn't left her with any other option.<p>Five months ago, in April, her husband of almost thirty-six years had disappeared. Vanished without a trace. One day everything was perfectly normal, and the next he was gone. Apparently by choice and without a word of explanation. Even now, Grace had difficulty believing that the man she'd lived with, the man she'd loved, and with whom she'd had two daughters, could do anything as cruel as this.<p>If Dan had fallen out of love with her, she could accept that. She would've found enough pride, enough generosity, to release him without bitterness. If he was that miserable in their marriage, she would've gladly set him free to find happiness with someone else. What she couldn't forgive was the misery he'd heaped on their family's shoulders, what he'd done to their daughters. EspeciallyKelly.<p>Dan had disappeared shortly after Kelly and Paul had announced that after years of trying, they were finally, excitedly, pregnant. Dan had been thrilled, and Grace too. This baby was going to be their first grandchild. They'd waited so long.<p>Kelly had always been close to her father and his disappearance at this critical time in her life had devastated her. She'd pleaded with Grace to postpone the divorce proceedings, convinced that her father would return before Tyler was born. When Dan did return, he'd have a logical reason and would explain everything to their satisfaction.<p>He hadn't come back, though, and there'd been no further information. Nothing but doubts, questions, and a churning, deepening anger that intensified in the endless weeks that followed.<p>When Grace couldn't stand not knowing any longer, she'd hired Roy McAfee, a private detective and former policeman she trusted. Roy had done an extensive search, certain that Dan had left a paper trail, and he'd been right. What Roy had uncovered was a complete shock to Grace. A year earlier, Dan had purchased a travel trailer, paying cash for it. Grace had no idea where he'd gotten that kind of money, nor did she know anything about the trailer. He'd never mentioned it, nor had she seen it. To this day she had no idea where he'd kept it all those months. Or where it was now.<p>Given the mounting evidence, she had her suspicions. Grace believed that Dan had used the travel trailer to sneak away with another woman. There'd been one sighting of him and it had come late in May.<p>It almost felt as if her husband had orchestrated this brief reappearance, as if he was taunting her, challenging her to find him. That day had been a low point for Grace.<p>A co-worker of Dan's had spotted him at the marina and hurried to the library to fetch her. But by the time Grace reached the marina, Dan was gone. A woman had pulled up to the curb and Dan had climbed into the vehicle and driven away, never to be seen or heard from again.<p>In retrospect, she'd come to believe that Dan was providing her with the answers she so desperately needed. She could think of no other reason he would mysteriously arrive at the busiest place in town, where he was most likely to be seen-and recognized. The library where she worked was less than two blocks away. Clearly, her husband lacked the courage to tell her there was someone else. Instead he'd chosen another, crueler way to inform her; he'd humiliated her in front of the entire community. Grace knew without being told that everyone in Cedar Cove pitied her.<p>That sighting had settled the matter in Grace's mind. Whatever love she still felt for Dan died that afternoon. Until then, she hadn't wanted to believe there was someone else. Even when the VISA bill showed up with a hefty charge from a local jeweler, Grace had refused to accept that her husband was involved with another woman. Dan just wasn't the kind of man who would be unfaithful to her. She'd trusted him. Not anymore.<p>"Are you okay, Mom?" Maryellen asked, touching her arm.<p>Grace's hand tightened around the pen. "Fine," she snapped, instantly regretting her tone. She hadn't meant to sound so sharp.<p>Her daughter looked away. Grace focused on the divorce papers, hesitated a moment longer and then with haste signed her name.<p>"I'll see that this is filed immediately," Mark Spellman said.<p>Grace relaxed, leaning back in her chair. This was all there was to it? You could end a thirty-five-year marriage simply by signing your name? "That's it?"<p>"Yes. Since you haven't heard from Daniel in five months, I don't foresee any legal complications. The divorce should be final in a few weeks."<p>Almost four decades tossed out the window like so much garbage. The good years, the bad years, the lean ones, the years they'd scrimped and saved. Like all couples, they'd had their share of problems, but despite everything they'd held their marriage together. Until now, until this-<p>"Mom?" Maryellen whispered. Grace nodded abruptly, surprised at the emotion that choked her. She'd shed all the tears she intended to. In the months since Dan's disappearance, Grace had deeply grieved the loss of her marriage and the man she thought she knew. The truth of it was, she no longer had a choice; divorce had become inevitable. It was essential that she protect her financial interests. According to the attorney, she couldn't afford the luxury of doing nothing.<p>Her legal situation was one thing, and she'd dealt with that, but the emotional impact had left her badly shaken. Despite her resolve, the grief hadn't diminished. And the humiliation of what Dan had done was with her constantly. Everyone in town was aware of her circumstances and the fact that her husband had walked out on her.<p>Slowly, Grace set the pen aside. "I'll wait to hear from you, then," she said to her attorney, rising out of the chair. Maryellen stood with her.<p>The attorney, a young man closer to Maryellen's age than her own, escorted them to the office door. He began to say something, then merely looked down and murmured a brief goodbye.<p>Outside his small home office, the sky had turned a depressing leaden gray. Grace felt a burden of sadness settle over her; she'd known this appointment wasn't going to be easy, but she hadn't expected it to exact such a toll on her self-confidence.<p><p> <br><blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'>Excerpted from <b>204 Rosewood Lane </b>by <b>Debbie Macomber </b> Copyright &copy 2002 by Debbie Macomber <br>Excerpted by permission.
