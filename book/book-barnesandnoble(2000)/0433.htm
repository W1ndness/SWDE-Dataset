He makes a handsome living doing what he enjoys. His wife, Penny, a children&rsquo;s book author and illustrator, is the love of his life. Together they have a brilliant six-year-old, Milo, affectionately dubbed &ldquo;Spooky,&rdquo; and a non-collie named Lassie, who&rsquo;s all but part of the family.<br>So Cubby knows he shouldn&rsquo;t let one bad review of his otherwise triumphant new book get to him &mdash; even if it does appear in the nation&rsquo;s premier newspaper and is penned by the much-feared, seldom-seen critic Shearman Waxx. Cubby knows that the best thing to do is ignore the gratuitously vicious, insulting, and inaccurate comments. Penny knows it; even little Milo knows it. If Lassie could talk, she&rsquo;d tell Cubby to ignore them, too.<br>Ignore Shearman Waxx and his poison pen is just what Cubby intends to do. Until he happens to learn where the great man is taking his lunch. Cubby just wants to get a look at the mysterious recluse whose mere opinion can make or break a career &mdash; or a life.<P>But Shearman Waxx isn&rsquo;t what Cubby expects, and neither is the escalating terror that follows what seemed to be an innocent encounter. For Waxx gives criticism; he doesn&rsquo;t take it. He has ways of dealing with those who cross him that Cubby is only beginning to fathom. Soon Cubby finds himself in a desperate struggle with a relentless sociopath, facing an inexorable assault on far more than his life.<br>Fearless, funny, utterly compelling, Relentless is Dean Koontz at his riveting best, an unforgettable tale of the fragile bonds that hold together all that we most cherish &mdash; and of those who would tear those bonds asunder.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>A bad book review propels this farcical thriller from bestseller Koontz (<I>Your Heart Belongs to Me</I>). Bestselling author Cullen "Cubby" Greenwich is mortified when Shearman Waxx, "the nation's premier literary critic," savages his work. Cubby manages to find the "syphilitic swine" at Roxie's Bistro in Newport Beach, Calif., where the author's six-year-old prodigy son nearly pees by accident on Waxx in the restaurant's men's room. In retaliation, Waxx threatens Cubby with doom and gets things started nicely by blowing up his house. With almost superhuman ease, the book critic keeps track of Cubby and his family as they flee for their lives. While some may take this as satire, the over-the-top villain's underdeveloped motivation and a jokey narrative tone that jars when juxtaposed with terrifying scenes of violence will leave others scratching their heads. By the time Koontz introduces a science fiction element, a lot of readers may have already checked out. <I>(June)</I></P>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

											After reading just a few average books from our old buddy Dean, I was really in the mood for some of that old thrill as found in &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot;. Here it is- Relentless. I'm so impressed by this book that I've just finished. Such memorable quotes and so well written. Reading some afterwards- noting the pro-atheist sentiment of some of his readers, and their aversion to his utilization of Catholicism in a lot of his books- that he has written for his old books, this one seems like it struck a bit close to home with him and it allowed his imagination to run wild. I hope you all enjoy RELENTLESS as much as I did!</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/By-the-Light-of-the-Moon/Dean-Koontz/e/9780553582765/?pv=y">By the Light of the Moon</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Odd-Thomas/Dean-Koontz/e/9780553584493/?pv=y">Odd Thomas (Odd Thomas Series #1)</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Life-Expectancy/Dean-Koontz/e/9780553588248/?pv=y">Life Expectancy</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Couldn't put it down!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Jake76JP">Jake76JP</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1405028_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780553591729_BK_1_1405028" href="#previewReview_1405028" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 14, 2010:

His imagination is a veritable factory of nightmares, conjuring twisted tales of psychological complexity. He even has a fan in Stephen King. For decades, Dean Koontz's name has been synonymous with terror, and his novels never fail to quicken the pulse and set hearts pounding.<p>    Koontz has a lifelong love of writing that led him to spend much of his free time as an adult furiously cultivating his style and voice. However, it was only after his wife Gerda made him an offer he couldn't refuse while he was teaching English at a high school outside of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that he had a real opportunity to make a living with his avocation. Gerda agreed to support Dean for five years, during which time he could try to get his writing career off the ground. Little did she know that by the end of that five years she would be leaving her own job to handle the financial end of her husband's massively successful writing career.<p>    Koontz first burst into the literary world with 1970's <I>Beastchild</I>, a science fiction novel that appealed to genre fans with its descriptions of aliens and otherworldly wars but also mined deeper themes of friendship and the breakdown of communication. Although it is not usually ranked among his classics, <I>Beastchild</I> provided the first inkling of Koontz's talent for populating even the most fantastical tale with fully human characters. Even at his goriest or most terrifying, he always allows room for redemption. <p>    This complexity is what makes Koontz's work so popular with readers. He has a true gift for tempering horror with humanity, grotesqueries with lyricism. He also has a knack for genre-hopping, inventing Hitchcockian romantic mysteries, crime dramas, supernatural thrillers, science fiction, and psychological suspense with equal deftness and imagination. Perhaps <I>The Times</I> (London) puts it best: "Dean Koontz is not just a master of our darkest dreams, but also a literary juggler."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Shortly after graduating from college, Koontz took a job</b> with the Appalachian Poverty Program where he would tutor and counsel underprivileged kids. However, after finding out that the last person who held his job had been beaten up and hospitalized by some of these kids, Koontz was more motivated than ever to get his writing career going.<P>    <b>When Koontz was a senior in college, </b> he won the <I>Atlantic Monthly</I> fiction competition.  <P>  <b>Koontz and Kevin Anderson's novel <I>Frankenstein: The Prodigal Son </I></b>was slotted to become a television series produced by Martin Scorsese. However, when the pilot failed to sell, the USA Network aired it as a TV movie in 2004. By that time Koontz had removed his name from the project.  <p>  <I>Some fun and fascinating outtakes from our interview with Koontz:</I><p>    <b>"My wife, Gerda, and I took seven years of private ballroom dancing lessons</b>, twice a week, ninety minutes each time. After we had gotten good at everything from swing to the foxtrot, we not only stopped taking lessons, but also stopped going dancing. <I>Learning</I> had been great fun; but for both of us, going out for an evening of dancing proved far less exhilarating than the learning. We both have a low boredom threshold. Now we dance at a wedding or other celebration perhaps once a year, and we're creaky." <p>    <b>"On my desk is a photograph given to me by my mother after Gerda and I were engaged</b> to be married. It shows 23 children at a birthday party. It is neither my party nor Gerda's. I am three years old, going on four. Gerda is three. In that crowd of kids, we are sitting directly across a table from each other. I'm grinning, as if I already know she's my destiny, and Gerda has a serious expression, as if she's worried that I might be <I>her</I> destiny. We never met again until I was a senior in high school and she was a junior. We've been trying to make up for that lost time ever since. <p>    <b>"Gerda and I worked so much for the first two decades of our marriage</b> that we never took a real vacation until our twentieth wedding anniversary. Then we went on a cruise, booking a first-class suite, sparing no expense. For more than half the cruise, the ship was caught in a hurricane. The open decks were closed because waves would have washed passengers overboard. About 90% of the passengers spent day after day in their cabins, projectile vomiting. We discovered that neither of us gets seasick. We had the showrooms, the casino, and the buffets virtually to ourselves. Because the crew had no one to serve, <I>our</I> service was exemplary. The ship dared not try to put into the scheduled ports; it was safer on the open sea. The big windows of the main bar presented a spectacular view of massive waves and lightning strikes that stabbed the sea by the score. Very romantic. We had a grand time. <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2006, Dean Koontz took some time out to talk with us about his favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>  <b>What was the book that most influenced your career as a writer?</b><br>   The high-school grammar textbook with which my teacher, Winona Garbrick, repeatedly rapped my head.<p>    Otherwise, hundreds of books have had an effect on me. Perhaps the book with the most impact on my career, after the aforementioned textbook, was <I>A Tale of Two Cities</I> by Charles Dickens, which I did not read until I was in my thirties. The final scene reduced me to tears. More important, I began to think about how modern publishing had compartmentalized fiction into so many narrow genres. <I>A Tale of Two Cities</I>, as a new piece of fiction, would be hard to place on a contemporary publisher's list. It's too much of an adventure story and too much of a love story to win the favor of most editors of "literary" fiction. It is a serious novel of politics and revolution but is also darkly comic in places. Dickens does not shrink from the depiction of evil, and some scenes are horrific, but he also tells a story of redemption and self-sacrifice and hope that some (never me!) would consider almost sentimental. <p>    The more I thought about <I>A Tale of Two Cities</I>, the more determined I became to write novels that bridged genres. This began to bear fruit with <I>Strangers</I>, and to a much greater degree with <I>Watchers</I>. My publisher at the time resisted both the variety I was delivering, book to book, but also the mix of genres within each book. Pressure was exerted to stay within the limits of one label. We had some wonderful rows! In time, readers responded with enthusiasm to my attempts to tell stories with the flavors and the techniques of multiple genres. I doubt I would have had a career half as successful if I had followed another path. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  For three decades, I read no fewer than 200 books a year, and I still read a book a week. Out of that volume, choosing eight or ten as my favorites is no easy task, and a final list inevitably has an arbitrary quality dependent on my mood at the moment. In no meaningful order: <p>    <li>The complete novels of John D. MacDonald -- His work taught me more about how to create suspense, about how to create vivid characters, about creating a sense of place, and about the beauty of an economical prose style than have the novels of any other single writer. When I discovered John D., I read 34 of his books in 30 days, not just in his Travis McGee series, but in his stand-alones, which are even better. That was the most exhilarating extended experience I've ever had as a reader. <p>    <li><I>The Moviegoer</I> and <I>Love in the Ruins</I> by Walker Percy -- I am drawn to writers who believe in timeless virtues, who have a tragic sense of the human condition but remain hopeful, who have a pellucid style that is deceptively simple even as, in fact, it deals with First Things, the least simple of all themes. <p>    <li><I>The Postman Always Rings Twice</I> and <I>Double Indemnity</I> by James M. Cain -- I love noir fiction from the first half of the 20th century, and these are two of the finest examples of the genre. I don't find much contemporary noir that interests me, largely because it is bleak and hopeless, often anarchic and misanthropic. The great noir fiction was informed by a moral sense, so that the self-destructive actions of the leads, and even the indifference of fate, left you with a sense of meaning and a feeling that, in your own life, you have been damn lucky to squeak by without self-destructing. <p>    <li><I>The Abolition of Man</I> by C. S. Lewis -- Over sixty years old, this beautifully written little book has proved stunningly predictive. The society that Lewis foresaw, arising from the "intellectual" elite's contempt for such virtues as courage and honor and selflessness, is the crumbling civilization we now inhabit. I read it every year to remind myself that ideas matter and that bad ideas, surer than guns and bombs, can bring down a nation, a world. <p>    <li><I>The Dreaming Jewels</I> by Theodore Sturgeon -- This science-fiction novel has more stunning ideas packed into a couple of hundred pages than some authors' entire bodies of work, delivered in a limpid yet magical prose. Bravura storytelling. <p>    <li><I>A Canticle for Leibowitz</I> by Walter M. Miller -- A post-nuclear-holocaust novel that combines science fiction and mysticism in a compelling story told in sometimes hallucinatory prose. This is one of those rare novels that is genuinely sui generis, a unique reading experience. <p>    <li><I>The Complete Poems of T. S. Eliot</I> -- He demands much of the reader, but no other poetry so richly rewards close reading, repeated reading, and contemplation. His early work is darker than what he wrote later, but dark in a way that is half a step short of utter hopelessness. Of the later poems, "Four Quartets" contains arguably the most distilled language in English verse, relentlessly pushing us to confront the central truth of our existence. The lines are hard and clean, beautiful, evocative, insistent, haunting, and with redemptive power. <p>    <li><I>The Busy Body</I>, <I>The Fugitive Pigeon</I>, and <I>The Spy in the Ointment</I> are three of Donald E. Westlake's early books, among the funniest suspense novels ever written. I read these in my youth, and many years later they inspired me to mix humor with suspense in books like <I>Life Expectancy</I>. Westlake is versatile, continually switching throughout his career from hard-boiled suspense to comic suspense, to mainstream fiction as easily as another writer might change his shirts. <p>    <li><I>There Must be a Pony</I> by James Kirkwood -- A tragedy, a comedy, and arguable the funniest novel ever written from an adolescent point of view. The voice of the narrator rings so true that you can hear him long after you've turned the last page. Kirkwood deserved a lot more success as a novelist than he enjoyed. <p>    <li><I>Solider in the Rain</I>, <I>Temple of Gold</I>, <I>Control</I> and <I>The Color of Light</I> by William Goldman -- Goldman has had a strong career as a novelist, but his greatest success has been as a screenwriter. If he hadn't scored so big with movies like <I>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</I>, if his energies had gone entirely into novels, I think he would have been HUGE. He creates some of the most appealing characters in all of contemporary fiction, unafraid of sentiment and never stepping across the line into sentimentality. <p>    The four books I named are radically different from one another, yet you hear the wonderfully assured and ironic Goldman voice unmistakably on the first page of each. <I>The Color of Light</I> is one of the most dead-on portraits of a writer's struggle ever written, hugely entertaining; but if you learn nothing from it other than the mortal danger of taking the write-what-you-know dictum too seriously, it's worth a hundred times its price. <p>    I could go on for pages. So many writers have made my life so much richer than it otherwise would have been. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  Films do not move me in the same way that novels do because they lack the ability to explore the <I>interior</I> of a character in any depth. Consequently, I tend to find films of high intellectual intent to be empty shells, and the films that burn themselves into my memory are those that deliver sparkling wit or genuine emotion, or logically crafted suspense. I can watch <I>The Philadelphia Story</I>, <I>Bringing Up Baby</I>, and other screwball comedies every three or four years, and they are fresh to me because the writing crackles. Contemporary comedies seem incapable of the spot-on hilarious dialogue of so many films in the 1930s and '40s. <p>    Two of the most involving and logically tight suspense films I've ever seen are James Cameron's <I>The Terminator</I> and <I>Aliens</I>. And I'm a Hitchcock fan because of the way so many of his movies blended suspense, humor, and love stories. For their ability to convey intense emotion (and a wide variety of emotions) in the service of important themes, I like <I>Schindler's List</I>, <I>A Simple Plan</I>, and <I>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</I>. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I listen to everything from classical to pop, but I particularly favor Big Band, Texas swing, and Zydeco. I've written hundreds of thousands of words listening to Chris Isaac, Paul Simon, and especially Israel Kamakawiwo'ole; Iz, the dynamite Hawaiian singer who died several years ago, had a beautiful voice and the ability to convey longing, joy, and other emotions with an effortlessness that enraptured the listener. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I give books based on the interests and tastes of the recipients, so I give all kinds of things. What I most like to receive are illustrated books on any period of art or any kind of decorative objects -- by which I mean everything from a book on an artist like Childe Hassam to a full-color book on Art Deco radios or on beautiful engraved rifles. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have to wear a five-point hat with five small bells, each of a different metal from the others, and leather gloves with knuckle spikes. Nothing unique about that. All writers have the five-point hat and the spiked gloves. I like the lighting low, music low, stacks of research surrounding me for easy reference, a bottle of flavored water -- usually cherry -- close at hand, which I'll drink either cold or at room temperature. For at least part of the day, though she might be bored, I like the company of my dog; she is a furry muse. <p>      <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I sold the first short story I ever wrote. Then I collected 75 rejections before I sold anything else. I was a part-time writer for two years and a full-time writer for eleven years before I had a paperback bestseller. I wrote for another five years before one of my books appeared on the hardcover bestseller lists. By the time I'd had two hardcover bestsellers, a major national magazine made a snarky remark to the effect that I was an overnight success who had "jumped on the bloody bandwagon of the vampire-novel craze." Because more than 18 years of work seems to stretch the definition of "overnight" a tad too far, and because I'd never written a vampire novel, I figured everything else that I was reading in the magazine must be equally empty of fact, and I canceled my subscription. <p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Most of the criticism you receive will be directed at your unique style. You will be pressured to modify your voice, to adopt the attitudes and prejudices of one herd or another. Thriller writers, science fiction writers, mystery writers, writers in every genre are expected to write like the successful models who have gone before them, with just enough exotic spice to intrigue without seeming dauntingly original. Even if you write experimental literary fiction, you will find that people who write and review experimental literary fiction have dogma that they want to enforce, and even out there on the imagined cutting edge, you will be shown the line that you must walk to be considered a serious writer. <p>    Resist. If you conform, you might be granted admittance to the club, you might be "discovered" and acclaimed, but you will not then be the writer you could have been. If you repress your true voice -- and therefore your passion -- long enough, you will burn out. Walker Percy gave the best advice <I>about</I> writing advice that I know: "The best thing to do with advice, even good advice, is to listen as hard as you can, take it to heart, then forget it." <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Bestselling novelist Cullen &ldquo;Cubby&rdquo; Greenwich is a lucky man and he knows it.

Bestselling author Cullen "Cubby" Greenwich is mortified when Shearman Waxx, "the nation's premier literary critic," savages his work. Cubby manages to find the "syphilitic swine" at Roxie's Bistro in Newport Beach, Calif., where the author's six-year-old prodigy son nearly pees by accident on Waxx in the restaurant's men's room. In retaliation, Waxx threatens Cubby with doom and gets things started nicely by blowing up his house. With almost superhuman ease, the book critic keeps track of Cubby and his family as they flee for their lives. While some may take this as satire, the over-the-top villain's underdeveloped motivation and a jokey narrative tone that jars when juxtaposed with terrifying scenes of violence will leave others scratching their heads. By the time Koontz introduces a science fiction element, a lot of readers may have already checked out. <I>(June)</I></P>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>"Cubby" Greenwich is a best-selling novelist with a new book out and reviews hitting the stands. When he's eviscerated by renowned critic Shearman Waxx in a review full of errors, he can't help but wonder at the man behind the critique, the inaccuracies, and the poor syntax. Following one relatively harmless run-in at a local restaurant, Cubby and his family (wife and fellow author Penny, six-year-old son and off-the-charts genius son "Spooky" Milo, and similarly spooky dog Lassie) are exposed to terrors beyond metaphorical slaying. Shearman Waxx is a man bent on destroying not merely Cubby's book sales but the man and his family. He has uncanny knowledge, and Cubby soon discovers that he's not the only author to fall victim to Waxx's psychopathic attentions. <i>Relentless</i> echoes the very best of the Odd Thomas series in voice; this is an exquisite crafting of the thrilling, the unexplainable, and the personal, with the mirth and whimsy that Koontz throws in seemingly effortlessly just when it's most needed and least expected. Koontz fans will snap up. Buy multiple copies. Highly recommended. [See Prepub Alert, <i>LJ</i>1/09.]</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A bestselling author and a death-dealing critic mix it up in this middling effort from thrillermeister Koontz (The Good Guy, 2007, etc.). Cullen (Cubby) Greenwich has a lot to thank Ralph for-Ralph being the playful name he's given his guardian angel. In his 30s, lucky Cubby has a beautiful wife, the world's smartest six-year-old son and a Lassie-like wonder dog named Lassie. Bonus&#58; Whenever he finishes a book it cleaves to bestseller lists with the tenacity of a barnacle. Ah, but Cubby is about to swallow some bitter pills. Suddenly, it seems that Ralph has lost focus, or perhaps ventured off on sabbatical, and Cubby's life, once so chipper, is plunged into bleakness. It starts with the reviews for One O'Clock Jump, Cubby's latest. They are raves, minus one. Shearman Waxx, the nation's most influential literary critic (can there be such a thing these days?) has noticed a Cubby novel for the first time. Cubby smolders, yearns for an encounter and, against the advice of all who love him, including that savvy six-year-old, makes it happen. The results are predictable. Well, not exactly predictable, since it turns out there are dark sides to Waxx. He's a killer, a description in no way metaphorical. That's real blood on his hands. Scared silly, the family takes off, Waxx and a bevy of sinister cohorts in hot pursuit for reasons somewhat less than persuasive. Bullets fly, body bags fill, dark conspiracies mushroom. Who, Cubby wonders, could have imagined that a Ralph-less world would be quite so fraught?Loosely plotted to say the least, but readers who can suspend disbelief after a line like this uttered by a six-year-old-"Mom, you've got to convince him to get a new agent"- may find somerewards.

I am not sure what this extreme capacity for mirth says about me. You&#8217;ll have to decide for yourself.<br><br>Beginning one night when I was six years old and for twenty-seven years thereafter, good luck was my constant companion. The guardian angel watching over me had done a superb job.<br><br>As a reward for his excellent stewardship of my life, perhaps my angel&#8212;let&#8217;s call him Ralph&#8212;was granted a sabbatical. Perhaps he was reassigned. Something sure happened to him for a while during my thirty-fourth year, when darkness found us.<br><br>In the days when Ralph was diligently on the job, I met and courted Penny Boom. I was twenty-four and she was twenty-three.<br><br>Women as beautiful as Penny previously looked through me. Oh, occasionally they looked at me, but as though I reminded them of something they had seen once in a book of exotic fungi, something they had never expected&#8212;or wished&#8212;to see in real life.<br><br>She was also too smart and too witty and too graceful to waste her time with a guy like me, so I can only assume that a supernatural power coerced her into marrying me. In my mind&#8217;s eye, I see Ralph kneeling beside Penny&#8217;s bed while she slept, whispering, &#8220;He&#8217;s the one for you, he&#8217;s the one for you, no matter how absurd that concept may seem at this moment, he really is the one for you.&#8221;<br><br>We were married more than three years when she gave birth to Milo, who is fortunate to have his mother&#8217;s blue eyes and black hair.<br><br>Our preferred namefor our son was Alexander. Penny&#8217;s mother, Clotilda&#8212;who is named Nancy on her birth certificate&#8212;threatened that if we did not call him Milo, she would blow her brains out.<br><br>Penny&#8217;s father, Grimbald&#8212;whose parents named him Larry&#8212;insisted that he would not clean up after such a suicide, and neither Penny nor I had the stomach for the job. So Alexander became Milo.<br><br>I am told that the family&#8217;s surname really is Boom and that they come from a long line of Dutch merchants. When I ask what commodity his ancestors sold, Grimbald becomes solemn and evasive, and Clotilda pretends that she is deaf.<br><br>My name is Cullen Greenwich&#8212;pronounced gren-itch, like the town in Connecticut. Since I was a little boy, most people have called me Cubby.<br><br>When I first dated Penny, her mom tried calling me Hildebrand, but I would have none of it.<br><br>Hildebrand is from the Old German, and means &#8220;battle torch&#8221; or &#8220;battle sword.&#8221; Clotilda is fond of power names, except in the case of our son, when she was prepared to self-destruct if we didn&#8217;t give him a name that meant &#8220;beloved and gentle.&#8221;<br><br>Our friend and internist, Dr. Jubal Frost, who delivered Milo, swears that the boy never cried at birth, that he was born smiling. In fact, Jubal says our infant softly hummed a tune, on and off, in the delivery room.<br><br>Although I was present at the birth, I have no memory of Milo&#8217;s musical performance because I fainted. Penny does not remember it either, because, although conscious, she was distracted by the postpartum hemorrhaging that had caused me to pass out.<br><br>I do not doubt Jubal Frost&#8217;s story. Milo has always been full of surprises. For good reason, his nickname is Spooky.<br><br>On his third birthday, Milo declared, &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna rescue a doggy.&#8221;<br><br>Penny and I assumed he was acting out something he had seen on TV, but he was a preschooler on a mission. He climbed onto a kitchen chair, plucked the car keys from the Peg&#8211;Board, and hurried out to the garage as if to set off in search of an endangered canine.<br><br>We took the keys away from him, but for more than an hour, he followed us around chanting, &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna rescue a doggy,&#8221; until to save our sanity, we decided to drive him to a pet shop and redirect his canine enthusiasm toward a gerbil or a turtle, or both.<br><br>En route, he said, &#8220;We&#8217;re almost to the doggy.&#8221; Half a block later, he pointed to a sign&#8212;animal shelter. We assumed wrongly that it was the silhouette of a German shepherd that caught his attention, not the words on the sign. &#8220;In there, Daddy.&#8221;<br><br>Scores of forlorn dogs occupied cages, but Milo walked directly to the middle of the center row in the kennel and said, &#8220;This one.&#8221;<br><br>She was a fifty-pound two-year-old Australian shepherd mix with a shaggy black-and-white coat, one eye blue and the other gray. She had no collie in her, but Milo named her Lassie.<br><br>Penny and I loved her the moment we saw her. Somewhere a gerbil and a turtle would remain in need of a home.<br><br>In the next three years, we never heard a single bark from the dog. We wondered whether our Lassie, following the example of the original, would at last bark if Milo fell down an abandoned well or became trapped in a burning barn, or whether she would instead try to alert us to our boy&#8217;s circumstances by employing urgent pantomime.<br><br>Until Milo was six and Lassie was five, our lives were not only free of calamity but also without much inconvenience. Our fortunes changed with the publication of my sixth novel, One O&#8217;Clock Jump.<br><br>My first five had been bestsellers. Way to go, Angel Ralph.<br><br>Penny Boom, of course, is the Penny Boom, the acclaimed writer and illustrator of children&#8217;s books. They are brilliant, funny books.<br><br>More than for her dazzling beauty, more than for her quick mind, more than for her great good heart, I fell in love with her for her sense of humor. If she ever lost her sense of humor, I would have to dump her. Then I&#8217;d kill myself because I couldn&#8217;t live without her.<br><br>The name on her birth certificate is Brunhild, which means someone who is armored for the fight. By the time she was five, she insisted on being called Penny.<br><br>At the start of World War Waxx, as we came to call it, Penny and Milo and Lassie and I lived in a fine stone-and-stucco house, under the benediction of graceful phoenix palms, in Southern California. We didn&#8217;t have an ocean view, but didn&#8217;t need one, for we were focused on one another and on our books.<br><br>Because we&#8217;d seen our share of Batman movies, we knew that Evil with a capital E stalked the world, but we never expected that it would suddenly, intently turn its attention to our happy household or that this evil would be drawn to us by a book I had written.<br><br>Having done a twenty-city tour for each of my previous novels, I persuaded my publisher to spare me that ordeal for One O&#8217;Clock Jump.<br><br>Consequently, on publication day, a Tuesday in early November, I got up at three o&#8217;clock in the morning to brew a pot of coffee and to repair to my first-floor study. Unshaven, in pajamas, I undertook a series of thirty radio interviews, conducted by telephone, between 4&#58;00 and 9&#58;30 a.m., which began with morning shows on the East Coast.<br><br>Radio hosts, both talk-jocks and traditional tune-spinners, do better interviews than TV types. Rare is the TV interviewer who has read your book, but eight of ten radio hosts will have read it.<br><br>Radio folks are brighter and funnier, too&#8212;and often quite humble.

<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><P><html><body> <H4> Relentless </font></H4> <b> A Novel </b></font> <hr noshade size="1"><b> By Dean Koontz </b></font></hr> <H4><b> Bantam </b></H4> <font size=-1><b> Copyright &copy; 2009 </b></font> <font size=-1><b> Dean Koontz <br>All right reserved.</b></font><br> <font size=-1><b> ISBN&#58; 9780553807141 </b></font><br> <hr noshade size='1'></hr>   <i>Chapter One</i><br><br><br>This is a thing I&#8217;ve learned&#58; Even with a gun to my head, I am capable of being convulsed with laughter. I am not sure what this extreme capacity for mirth says about me. You&#8217;ll have to decide for yourself.<br><br>Beginning one night when I was six years old and for twenty-seven years thereafter, good luck was my constant companion. The guardian angel watching over me had done a superb job.<br><br>As a reward for his excellent stewardship of my life, perhaps my angel&#8212;let&#8217;s call him Ralph&#8212;was granted a sabbatical. Perhaps he was reassigned. Something sure happened to him for a while during my thirty-fourth year, when darkness found us.<br><br>In the days when Ralph was diligently on the job, I met and courted Penny Boom. I was twenty-four and she was twenty-three.<br><br>Women as beautiful as Penny previously looked through me. Oh, occasionally they looked at me, but as though I reminded them of something they had seen once in a book of exotic fungi, something they had never expected&#8212;or wished&#8212;to see in real life.<br><br>She was also too smart and too witty and too graceful to waste her time with a guy like me, so I can only assume that a supernatural power coerced her into marrying me. In my mind&#8217;s eye, I see Ralph kneeling beside Penny&#8217;s bedwhile she slept, whispering, &#8220;He&#8217;s the one for you, he&#8217;s the one for you, no matter how absurd that concept may seem at this moment, he really is the one for you.&#8221;<br><br>We were married more than three years when she gave birth to Milo, who is fortunate to have his mother&#8217;s blue eyes and black hair.<br><br>Our preferred name for our son was Alexander. Penny&#8217;s mother, Clotilda&#8212;who is named Nancy on her birth certificate&#8212;threatened that if we did not call him Milo, she would blow her brains out.<br><br>Penny&#8217;s father, Grimbald&#8212;whose parents named him Larry&#8212;insisted that he would not clean up after such a suicide, and neither Penny nor I had the stomach for the job. So Alexander became Milo.<br><br>I am told that the family&#8217;s surname really is Boom and that they come from a long line of Dutch merchants. When I ask what commodity his ancestors sold, Grimbald becomes solemn and evasive, and Clotilda pretends that she is deaf.<br><br>My name is Cullen Greenwich&#8212;pronounced gren-itch, like the town in Connecticut. Since I was a little boy, most people have called me Cubby.<br><br>When I first dated Penny, her mom tried calling me Hildebrand, but I would have none of it.<br><br>Hildebrand is from the Old German, and means &#8220;battle torch&#8221; or &#8220;battle sword.&#8221; Clotilda is fond of power names, except in the case of our son, when she was prepared to self-destruct if we didn&#8217;t give him a name that meant &#8220;beloved and gentle.&#8221;<br><br>Our friend and internist, Dr. Jubal Frost, who delivered Milo, swears that the boy never cried at birth, that he was born smiling. In fact, Jubal says our infant softly hummed a tune, on and off, in the delivery room.<br><br>Although I was present at the birth, I have no memory of Milo&#8217;s musical performance because I fainted. Penny does not remember it either, because, although conscious, she was distracted by the postpartum hemorrhaging that had caused me to pass out.<br><br>I do not doubt Jubal Frost&#8217;s story. Milo has always been full of surprises. For good reason, his nickname is Spooky.<br><br>On his third birthday, Milo declared, &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna rescue a doggy.&#8221;<br><br>Penny and I assumed he was acting out something he had seen on TV, but he was a preschooler on a mission. He climbed onto a kitchen chair, plucked the car keys from the Peg&#8211;Board, and hurried out to the garage as if to set off in search of an endangered canine.<br><br>We took the keys away from him, but for more than an hour, he followed us around chanting, &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna rescue a doggy,&#8221; until to save our sanity, we decided to drive him to a pet shop and redirect his canine enthusiasm toward a gerbil or a turtle, or both.<br><br>En route, he said, &#8220;We&#8217;re almost to the doggy.&#8221; Half a block later, he pointed to a sign&#8212;animal shelter. We assumed wrongly that it was the silhouette of a German shepherd that caught his attention, not the words on the sign. &#8220;In there, Daddy.&#8221;<br><br>Scores of forlorn dogs occupied cages, but Milo walked directly to the middle of the center row in the kennel and said, &#8220;This one.&#8221;<br><br>She was a fifty-pound two-year-old Australian shepherd mix with a shaggy black-and-white coat, one eye blue and the other gray. She had no collie in her, but Milo named her Lassie.<br><br>Penny and I loved her the moment we saw her. Somewhere a gerbil and a turtle would remain in need of a home.<br><br>In the next three years, we never heard a single bark from the dog. We wondered whether our Lassie, following the example of the original, would at last bark if Milo fell down an abandoned well or became trapped in a burning barn, or whether she would instead try to alert us to our boy&#8217;s circumstances by employing urgent pantomime.<br><br>Until Milo was six and Lassie was five, our lives were not only free of calamity but also without much inconvenience. Our fortunes changed with the publication of my sixth novel, One O&#8217;Clock Jump.<br><br>My first five had been bestsellers. Way to go, Angel Ralph.<br><br>Penny Boom, of course, is the Penny Boom, the acclaimed writer and illustrator of children&#8217;s books. They are brilliant, funny books.<br><br>More than for her dazzling beauty, more than for her quick mind, more than for her great good heart, I fell in love with her for her sense of humor. If she ever lost her sense of humor, I would have to dump her. Then I&#8217;d kill myself because I couldn&#8217;t live without her.<br><br>The name on her birth certificate is Brunhild, which means someone who is armored for the fight. By the time she was five, she insisted on being called Penny.<br><br>At the start of World War Waxx, as we came to call it, Penny and Milo and Lassie and I lived in a fine stone-and-stucco house, under the benediction of graceful phoenix palms, in Southern California. We didn&#8217;t have an ocean view, but didn&#8217;t need one, for we were focused on one another and on our books.<br><br>Because we&#8217;d seen our share of Batman movies, we knew that Evil with a capital E stalked the world, but we never expected that it would suddenly, intently turn its attention to our happy household or that this evil would be drawn to us by a book I had written.<br><br>Having done a twenty-city tour for each of my previous novels, I persuaded my publisher to spare me that ordeal for One O&#8217;Clock Jump.<br><br>Consequently, on publication day, a Tuesday in early November, I got up at three o&#8217;clock in the morning to brew a pot of coffee and to repair to my first-floor study. Unshaven, in pajamas, I undertook a series of thirty radio interviews, conducted by telephone, between 4&#58;00 and 9&#58;30 a.m., which began with morning shows on the East Coast.<br><br>Radio hosts, both talk-jocks and traditional tune-spinners, do better interviews than TV types. Rare is the TV interviewer who has read your book, but eight of ten radio hosts will have read it.<br><br>Radio folks are brighter and funnier, too&#8212;and often quite humble. I don&#8217;t know why this last should be true, except perhaps the greater fame of facial recognition, which comes with regular television exposure, encourages pridefulness that ripens into arrogance.<br><br>After five hours on radio, I felt as though I might vomit if I heard myself say again the words One O&#8217;Clock Jump. I could see the day coming when, if I was required to do much publicity for a new book, I would write it but not allow its publication until I died.<br><br>If you have never been in the public eye, flogging your work like a carnival barker pitching a freak show to the crowd, this publish-only-after-death pledge may seem extreme. But protracted self-promotion drains something essential from the soul, and after one of these sessions, you need weeks to recover and to decide that one day it might be all right to like yourself again.<br><br>The danger in writing but not publishing was that my agent, Hudson &#8220;Hud&#8221; Jacklight, receiving no commissions, would wait only until three unpublished works had been completed before having me killed to free up the manuscripts for marketing.<br><br>And if I knew Hud as well as I thought I did, he would not arrange for a clean shot to the back of the head. He would want me to be tortured and dismembered in such a flamboyant fashion that he could make a rich deal for one of his true-crime clients to write a book about my murder.<br><br>If no publisher would pay a suitably immense advance for a book about an unsolved killing, Hud would have someone framed for it. Most likely Penny, Milo, and Lassie.<br><br>Anyway, after the thirtieth interview, I rose from my office chair and, reeling in self-disgust, made my way to the kitchen. My intention was to eat such an unhealthy breakfast that my guilt over the cholesterol content would distract me from the embarrassment of all the self-promotion.<br><br>Dependable Penny had delayed her breakfast so she could eat with me and hear all of the incredibly witty things I wished I had said in those thirty interviews. In contrast to my tousled hair, unshaven face, and badly rumpled pajamas, she wore a crisp white blouse and lemon-yellow slacks, and as usual her skin glowed as though it were translucent and she were lit from inside.<br><br>As I entered the room, she was serving blueberry pancakes, and I said, &#8220;You look scrumptious. I could pour maple syrup on you and eat you alive.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Cannibalism,&#8221; Milo warned me, &#8220;is a crime.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a worldwide crime,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Some places it&#8217;s a culinary preference.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It&#8217;s a crime,&#8221; he insisted.<br><br>Between his fifth and sixth birthdays, Milo had decided on a career in law enforcement.
