</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Welcome to the world of perverse self-mutilation, insane coincidences and extreme makeovers speckled with violent acts and prescription drugs. After surviving a gunshot wound that destroyed half her face, Shannon meets the vivacious Brandy Alexander, whose glamorous nature seduces her into traveling cross-country in a delightful and ironic crime spree. In typical Palahniuk fashion, the story leaps about in an erratic and initially bewildering manner, but ultimately makes sense. Anna Fields executes a brilliant performance through Shannon's first-person narrative. Her smooth and stable tone leads listeners through this deliciously chaotic tale. When Shannon speaks, Fields proves both amusing and impressive. Her magnificent performance only adds to Palahniuk's story. <I>Norton paperback</I><I>(Reviews, July 5, 1999).

											I first picked up this book because I was required to read some sort of book for my creative writing class. My only initial reason to read it was because it was the first thing I saw. After I started reading, it kept me interested so I decided I had to finish it. Overall I think the book is well written, what kept me wanting to read more was mainly the style it was written in. The whole book is in different stories and you never know what story the author is going to jump to next. Another thing I thought made it interesting was the story line in general. The bluntness of the character made me laugh out loud a few times, and you really end up feeling for the character in the end. Some parts got a tad bit lengthy and too descriptive, but overall I would recommend this book if you're looking for something a little bit different.<p/>(HF)</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>read it<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=sassafrassMM">sassafrassMM</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1372812_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780393319293_BK_1_1372812" href="#previewReview_1372812" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 04, 2010: 
											I've read many Palahniuk books so far- Snuff, Diary, Lullaby,Choke, &amp; Fight Club- and this one is by far my favorite. All of his books are out there but this one's pretty intense. It's hard to describe; this book is soo messed up but I could not put it down.

Palahniuk</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Portland, Oregon</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>February 21, 1962</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Pasco, Washington</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A. in journalism, University of Oregon, 1986</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.chuckpalahniuk.net">* Chuck Palahniuk's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Readers of Chuck Palahniuk's novels must gird themselves for the bizarre, the violent, the macabre, and the just plain disturbing. Having done that, they can then just enjoy the ride.<P>    The story goes that Palahniuk wrote <i>Fight Club</i> out of frustration. Believing  that his first submission to publishers (an early version of <I>Invisible Monsters</I>) was being rejected as too risky, he decided to take the gloves off, so to speak, and wrote something he never expected to see the light of day. Ironically, <i>Fight Club</I> was accepted for publication, and its subsequent filming by directory David Fincher earned the author an obsessive cult following. <p>    The apocalyptic, blackly humorous story of a loner's entanglement with a charismatic but dangerous underground leader, <i>Fight Club</i> was the first in a series of controversial fiction that would keep Palahniuk in the spotlight. Since then, he has crafted strange, disturbing tales around unlikely subjects: a disfigured model bent on revenge (the revised <i>Invisible Monsters</i>) ... the last surviving member of a death cult (<i>Survivor</i>) ... a sex addict who resorts to a bizarre restaurant scam to pay the bills (<i>Choke</I>) ... a lethal African nursery rhyme (<i>Lullaby</I>) ... and so the list continues.<p>    Although Palahniuk makes occasional forays into nonfiction, (e.g., <i>Fugitives and Refugees</I> and <i>Stranger than Fiction</I>), it is his novels that generate the most buzz. His outr� plots and jump-cut storytelling are definitely not for everyone -- some have likened them to the horrible accident you can't tear your eyes away from -- but even critics can't help but be impressed by his flair for language, his talent for satire, and his sheer originality. <i>Newsday</i> wrote, "Palahniuk is one of the freshest, most intriguing voices to appear in a long time. He rearranges Vonnegut's sly humor, DeLillo's mordant social analysis, and Pynchon's antic surrealism (or is it R. Crumb's?) into a gleaming puzzle palace all his own."   <p>  Palahniuk has said that he has heard a lot from readers who were never readers before they saw his books, from boys in schools where his books are banned. This might be the best evidence that Palahniuk is a writer for a new age, introducing a (mostly male) audience to worlds on the page that usually only exist in technicolor nightmares.</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Palahniuk (pronounced paul-a-nik)</b> worked as a diesel mechanic for a trucking company before he became an author, jotting story notes for <i>The Fight Club</i> under trucks he was supposed to be working on.<p>    <b>Palahniuk's family</b> has had a sad history of violence: His grandfather killed his grandmother and then committed suicide; later in life, his divorced father was murdered in 1999 by a girlfriend's ex-husband. The killer was convicted and sentenced to death in October, 2001. Palahniuk's book, <i>Choke</i>, was driven by an attempt to look at how sexual compulsion can destroy (see essay below for more).<P>    <b>When not working on his novels</b>, Palahniuk has written features for <i>Gear</i> magazine, through which he befriended shock rocker Marilyn Manson; and is reportedly working on a script of the Katie Arnoldi novel <i>Chemical Pink</i> for <i>Fight Club</i> director David Fincher.<p>    <b>While writing</b>, Palahniuk has said he listens to Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, and Radiohead.<p>    <b>To a reader</b> who asked in a Barnes & Noble.com chat why the novel <i>Invisible Monsters</i> was not released in hardcover, Palahniuk responded: "My original request was not to have any of my books released as hardcovers b/c I felt guilty asking for over $20 for anything I had done. With <i>Invisible Monsters</i>  I finally got my way."<P>  <b><i>Invisible Monsters</i></b> was inspired by fashion magazines Palahniuk was reading at his laundromat, according to an interview with <i>The Village Voice</i>. "I love the language of fashion magazines. Eighteen adjectives and you find the word sweater at the end. 'Ethereal. Sacred.' I thought, Wouldn't it be fun to write a novel in this fashion magazine language, so packed with hyperbole?"</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2004, Chuck Palahniuk took some time to talk with us about some of his favorite books, authors and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  <I>The Great Gatsby</I> by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It showed me how to write a "hero" story by using an apostle as the narrator. Really, it's the basis of the triangle of two men and one woman in my book, <I>Fight Club</I>. I read the book at least once a year and it continues to surprise me with layers of emotion. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  These are in no particular order or rank... <p>  <ul>  <li><I>Reasons to Live</I> by Amy Hempel -- Each of Hempel's stories pay off with more emotion than most full length novels.<p>    <li><I>The Informers</I> by Bret Easton Ellis -- Another short story collection, Ellis's book shows the dark and funny world of people trapped by their own need for fame and money and love.<p>    <li><I>Jesus' Son</I> by Denis Johnson -- These stories have moments so shocking and distasteful that you have to admire Johnston for being brave enough to risk writing them.<p>    <li><I>The Ice at the Bottom of the World</I> by Mark Richard -- His story, "Strays," is my favorite. All of his language pops with hard dental sounds -- P's and K's -- and this makes the collection a delight to read out loud. <p>    <li><I>The Pugilist at Rest</I> by Thom Jones -- Again, here are hard unsentimental stories that somehow break your heart while they make you laugh.<p>    <li><I>Drown</I> by Junot Diaz -- These may be the bleakest childhood stories ever published, but the plot tension and the love between family members force you to finish the book.<p>    <li><I>Ill Nature</I> by Joy Williams -- Here is the brutal description of how humans have treated the natural world. The book is so painful, at times, you must put it down. Still, you always go back to re-read it. <p>    <li><I>The Martian Chronicles</I> by Ray Bradbury -- As a kid, I carried this book everyday, everywhere, for two years. The stories create a collage of an epic story better than any single narrative ever could.<p>    <li><I>At the Gates of the Animal Kingdom</I> by Amy Hemple -- These stories carry the power of great "Slam" poetry. They function more like magic spells to put you into a trance and make Hemple's world more real than your own. <p>    <li><I>The Call of the Wild</I> by Jack London -- My brother and I memorized most of this book as children. London's frontier world seen through animals was my favorite fantasy.</ul><p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  Favorite films, in no rank:<p>  <ul>  <li><I>Session 9</I> -- This horror/thriller has the tightest plot and most clever voice over device I have ever seen. The tension lasts until the final credits roll. <p>    <li><I>The Haunting</I> -- The original 1964 black and white version proves that good writing is more frightening than any movie magic special effect.<p>    <li><I>Jesus of Montreal</I> -- This French-Canadian film is the most moving movie I have seen. Even with subtitles, it brings me to tears. </ul>  <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  While writing, I tend to repeat the same song, endlessly, for thousands of times. This helps me ignore any lyrics, and helps create a consistent mood for each book. The songs have included "Creep" by Radiohead, "The Fragile" by Nine Inch Nails, "Shine On, You Crazy Diamond" by Pink Floyd, "Little Fifteen" by Depeche Mode, and "Bela Lugosi's Dead" by Bauhaus. <p>        <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give � and get � as gifts?</b><br>  My favorite books to give or get are short story collections. And, always paperbacks because they are easy to carry as you travel.<p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  My only writing ritual is to shave my head bald between writing the first and second drafts of a book. If I can throw away all my hair, then I have the freedom to trash any part of the book on the next rewrite. <p>      <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  My only "rejection" story is how I accepted a tiny advance for the book <I>Fight Club</I> -- not realizing the publisher was trying to offend me while not offending their own staff editor who loved the book. I got $6,000 and was thrilled. Since then, other writers tell me that an advance this small is known as "kiss-off money."<p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  My best advice for writers is: Have your adventures, make your mistakes, and choose your friends poorly -- all these make for great stories. But what's most important is that you <I>Do Not Die</I>. Also, avoid getting brain damage. Have fun, but don't die. We digest our lives by turning our experience into stories, so find some way to turn every event into a story you can express and exhaust of all its emotion. That way, bad events won't exhaust you. Then, never stop writing those stories. <p><h3>Feature Essay</h3><i>An essay about</i> Choke <i>from Chuck Palahniuk</i><p>  Bill was the first man I ever met who called himself a sex addict. This was in a church conference room, on a Thursday night, where a couple dozen men and women sat in plastic chairs around a table stained with poster paint and glue. Bill is a big guy, wearing three layers of plaid flannel shirts, with a big square chin and a booming gruff voice.   <p>  This is just after Christmas, the first Christmas in almost 20 years that Bill says he didn't spend with his wife and kids. Instead, he put on a dress and went downtown to an adult bookstore and gave blow jobs all day.   <p>  This is the world of sexual compulsives. One by one, almost everybody around that table, very ordinary folks, young and old, hip and square, men and woman, they took turns telling about their week's worth of sex with prostitutes, lingerie models, and strangers. They talked about Internet sex, public-bathroom sex, and telephone sex. None of these people were anyone you'd look at twice on the street, but their secret lives were amazing.   <p>  Everybody in my family does something compulsively. My brother exercises. My mother gardens. I write. That's part of the reason why I was at this meeting.   <p>  This is the rest of the reason:   <p>  Ten-plus years ago, my brother joked that the best place to meet women was at support groups for sexually irresponsible people.   <p>  At the time, he was engaged to a beautiful woman. She was funny and charming and looked just like Vanna White. The two of them had met at work, and my brother knew about the support groups because she went to them. They'd almost gotten married, but he'd heard some rumors about what she did while he was gone on business trips.   <p>  To resolve the issue, before he left for his next trip, he put a voice-activated tape recorded under the bed in his apartment. When he came home, the tape was run all the way through. Rewinding it and listening, he says, was the hardest thing he's ever done in his life.   <p>  On the tape, his fianc&eacute;e was drunk and bringing home guy after guy -- to his bed. The second-hardest thing he's ever done was confronting her with the tape and ending their engagement.   <p>  Today, he's married with a beautiful family, married to someone else.   <p>  He told me this story one summer while we drove to Idaho to help identify a body the police said might be our father. The body was found, shot, next to the body of a woman, in a burned-down garage in the mountains outside Kendrick, Idaho.   <p>  This was the summer of 1999. The summer the  <i>Fight Club</i> movie came out. We went to our father's house in the mountains outside of Spokane, trying to track down some X-rays that showed the two vertebrae fused in Dad's back after a railroad accident left him disabled.   <p>  My father's place in the mountains was beautiful, hundreds of acres, wild turkeys and moose and deer everywhere. On the road up to the house, there was a new sign. It was next to a boulder that lay beside the road. It said, "Kismet Rock." We had no idea what the sign meant.   <p>  Once at a toga party, I was drinking with a friend, Cindy, and she said, "Let me tell you about my mother. My mother gets married a lot." It was such a great line I used it in <i>Invisible Monsters</i>. I knew exactly what Cindy meant.   <p>  Part of visiting my dad was always meeting his latest girlfriend. Or wife.   <p>  Before my brother and I could find the X-rays, the police called to say the body was Dad's. They'd used dental records we'd shipped to them earlier.   <p>  At the trial of the man who murdered him, it came out that my father had answered a personal ad placed by a woman whose ex-husband had threatened to kill her and any man that he ever found her with. The title of the personal ad was "Kismet." My father was one of five men who answered it. He was the one she chose.   <p>  This was the dead woman found beside my father. She and my father had gone to her home to feed some animals before driving to my father's house, where he was going to surprise her with the "Kismet Rock" sign. A sort of landmark named for their new relationship.   <p>  Her ex-husband was waiting and followed them up the driveway. According to the court's verdict, he killed them and set fire to their bodies in the garage. They'd known each other for less than two months.   <p>  That first support group for sex addicts, I went because I wanted to understand my father. I wanted to know what he dealt with and why his life was girlfriend after girlfriend, wife after wife.   <p>  At the meeting in the church conference room, here were very everyday-looking people, telling stories that even their own spouses didn't know. I just sat there, and even though everyone was supposed to limit their sharing to a few minutes, we always ran out of time before everyone had to speak. People were so hungry to share their pain.   <p>  Several months after meeting Bill, after his story about blow jobs on Christmas Day, he came to the group upset. The fourth step in the 12-step process is to keep a record of your addiction, recording all your transgressions, past and present. Bill's wife had found his notebook. She'd told him she made copies, and -- if he didn't give her the kids, the money, the house, the cars, and then move to another state -- she was going to give the copies to all his family and coworkers.   <p>  Bill was frantic, and his only way out, he told everyone, was to go home and kill her and kill himself.   <p>  He seemed so resolved.   <p>  I kept thinking, This is how it happens. All those newspaper stories about murder/suicides, this is how they happen.   <p>  The group got Bill calmed down. He wept. A few weeks later, he and his wife had resolved to stay married and face his addiction, together.   <p>  During this time, a friend introduced me to a woman. This was at breakfast in a restaurant, and it was funny because her name was Marla. Like Marla Singer in <i>Fight Club</i>. I'd never met a real Marla, and it turned out she's a therapist who works with sexual compulsives. Piece by piece, the ideas and themes of <i>Choke</i> were coming together.   <p>  I wanted to write about the moment when your addictions no longer hide the truth from you. When your whole life breaks down. That's the moment when you have to somehow choose what your life is going to be about. Doping yourself with sex or drugs or food, or choosing something like writing, body building, gardening. True, in a way this is trading one compulsive behavior for another, but at least with the new one, you're choosing it.   <p>  Funny, but all my former junkie friends are either fervent Christians or triathletes. Nothing in half measures.   <p>  As Paige Marshall says in the book, "You have to trade your youth for something." With <i>Choke</i> I wanted to show someone actively choosing their future, instead of perpetuating their past.   <p>  Here, I want to tell you how lovely and clever my brother's former fianc&eacute;e was.   <p>  I want you to know how happy it felt to see Bill resolve to save his marriage.   <p>  I want to tell you how my father spent years with my brother and I, building huge model train sets with papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; mountain ranges and working streetlights. We'd go into town, to Bailey's Toys and Hobbies, and buy a new locomotive for our birthdays. We'd glue specks of sand, just so, to create the perfect miniature roadbed for our tracks. Yeah, it's sounds like compulsive behavior, but it was so sweet.   <p>  Here at the end, I want to thank you, for your time and attention. And thank you for taking a chance with my books. This is the story behind the story.   <p>  I'll shut up now,   <p>  <i>--Chuck</i></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Palahniuk's writing is percussive.

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Welcome to the world of perverse self-mutilation, insane coincidences and extreme makeovers speckled with violent acts and prescription drugs. After surviving a gunshot wound that destroyed half her face, Shannon meets the vivacious Brandy Alexander, whose glamorous nature seduces her into traveling cross-country in a delightful and ironic crime spree. In typical Palahniuk fashion, the story leaps about in an erratic and initially bewildering manner, but ultimately makes sense. Anna Fields executes a brilliant performance through Shannon's first-person narrative. Her smooth and stable tone leads listeners through this deliciously chaotic tale. When Shannon speaks, Fields proves both amusing and impressive. Her magnificent performance only adds to Palahniuk's story. <I>Norton paperback</I><I>(Reviews, July 5, 1999). (Feb.)</I></P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Palahniuk's grotesque romp aims to skewer the ruthless superficiality of the fashion world and winds up with a tale as savagely glib as what it derides. Narrator Shannon McFarland, once a gorgeous fashion model, has been hideously disfigured in a mysterious drive-by shooting. Her jaw has been shot off, leaving her not only bereft of a career and boyfriend, but suddenly invisible to the world. Along comes no-nonsense, pill-popping diva Brandy Alexander, a resplendent, sassy, transgendered chick, who has modeled her body rearrangement--the breast implants, the hair, the figure--on what Shannon used to look like. Brandy suggests veils, high camp and no self-pity. Shannon wants revenge: first on her supposedly best friend Evie, who has been squeezing her size nine body into Shannon's size six wardrobe, then on her fianc , Manus Kelly, who has been running around with Evie. Since Shannon now believes that Manus and Evie orchestrated her "accident," Shannon rustles up a few arson/kidnapping "accidents" of her own. Then she learns that Brandy is actually her long-lost brother, Shane, who supposedly died of AIDS after his parents kicked him out of their home. (Since then, the McFarlands have become militant gay rights activists, trading on their "grief.") Amid the family drama, Shannon manages to exact her revenge on Manus by surreptitiously slipping him estrogen and enjoying his dismay at sprouting unwanted breasts. Adding to the plot's contrivances are the relentless flashbacks, heralded at the beginning of almost every paragraph with "Jump back to..." and the author's pretentious device of using a fashion photographer's commands ("Flash. Give me adoration. Flash. Give me a break") to signpost the narrator's epiphanies. Palahniuk writes like he's overdosed on Details magazine. Though the absurd surprise ending may incite groans of disbelief, this book does have fun moments when campy banter tops the heroine's flat, whiny bathos. (Sept.) FYI: The film of Palahniuk's novel Fight Club will star Brad Pitt. Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A macabre fantasy, in which a deformed model is guided by a drag queen down the yellow brick road of her past to the Emerald City of her future&#151;all dreamed up by cult novelist Palahniuk (Survivor, 1998) in one of his more baroque moods.  There is a certain point in all bedroom farces and comedies of errors when you give up trying to figure out who's who and just go along for the ride. That might be the wisest strategy here. Our narrator is one Shannon McFarland (although she doesn't actually introduce herself until the very end), and she's a real mess, quite literally&#58; she was injured in a mysterious shooting and has lost her entire jaw and most of her face. Oddly (or perhaps not so oddly?), Shannon's brother Shane was also disfigured in a suspicious accident when he dumped a load of trash into the fire and a can of hair spray exploded in his face. Shane eventually turned gay and was thrown out of the house by his parents, who later learned that he had died of AIDS. Shannon grew up, became a supermodel, and got herself engaged to Manus, a vice-squad detective who ditches Shannon after her accident and takes up with Evie Cotrell, a rich Texas bimbo who used to be Shannon's roommate and may have been a man early in her career. But never mind Evie; the one to watch is drag diva Brandy Alexander, who meets Shannon in the hospital and soon becomes her only friend. Brandy takes Shannon on the road, and&#151;along with Brandy's boyfriend Alfa Romeo, who in reality may be Manus&#151;the two steal drugs from expensive homes by calling realtors and posing as potential buyers. Eventually, Shannon discovers that Brandy is not who she appears to be, but by then we're ready for anything.Too clever by half&#58; a Chinese box of a novel fascinating in its intricacies but pretty hard to get a grip on whole.<P>

<p>
Where you're supposed to be is some big West Hills wedding reception in a big manor house with flower arrangements and stuffed mushrooms all over the house. This is called scene setting: where everybody is, who's alive, who's dead. This is Evie Cottrell's big wedding reception moment. Evie is standing halfway down the big staircase in the manor house foyer, naked inside what's left of her wedding dress, still holding her rifle.
<p>
Me, I'm standing at the bottom of the stairs but only in a physical way. My mind is, I don't know where.
<p>
Nobody's all-the-way dead yet, but let's just say the clock is ticking.
<p>
Not that anybody in this big drama is a real alive person, either. You can trace everything about Evie Cottrell's look back to some television commercial for an organic shampoo, except right now Evie's wedding dress is burned down to just the hoopskirt wires orbiting her hips and just the little wire skeletons of all the silk flowers that were in her hair. And Evie's blonde hair, her big, teased-up, back-combed rainbow in every shade of blonde blown up with hairspray, well, Evie's hair is burned off, too.
<p>
The only other character here is Brandy Alexander, who's laid out, shotgunned, at the bottom of the staircase, bleeding to death.
<p>
What I tell myself is the gush of red pumping out of Brandy's bullet hole is less like blood than it's some sociopolitical tool. The thing about being cloned from all those shampoo commercials, well, that goes for me and Brandy Alexander, too. Shotgunning anybody in this room would be the moral equivalent of killing a car, a vacuum cleaner, a Barbie doll. Erasing a computer disk. Burning a book. Probably that goes for killing anybody in the world. We're all such products.
<p>
Brandy Alexander, the long-stemmed latte queen supreme of the top-drawer party girls, Brandy is gushing her insides out through a bullet hole in her amazing suit jacket. The suit, it's this white Bob Mackie knock-off Brandy bought in Seattle with a tight hobble skirt that squeezes her ass into the perfect big heart shape. You would not believe how much this suit cost. The mark-up is about a zillion percent. The suit jacket has a little peplum skirt and wide lapels and shoulders. The single-breasted cut is symmetrical except for the hole pumping out blood.
<p>
Then Evie starts to sob, standing there halfway up the staircase. Evie, that deadly virus of the moment. This is our cue to all look at poor Evie, poor, sad Evie, hairless and wearing nothing but ashes and circled by the wire cage of her burned-up hoop skirt. Then Evie drops the rifle. With her dirty face in her dirty hands, Evie sits down and starts to boo-hoo, as if crying will solve anything. The rifle, this is a loaded thirty-aught rifle, it clatters down the stairs and skids out into the middle of the foyer floor, spinning on its side, pointing at me, pointing at Brandy, pointing at Evie, crying.
<p>
It's not that I'm some detached lab animal just conditioned to ignore violence, but my first instinct is maybe it's not too late to dab club soda on the bloodstain.
<p>
Most of my adult life so far has been me standing on seamless paper for a raft of bucks per hour, wearing clothes and shoes, my hair done and some famous fashion photographer telling me how to feel.
<p>
Him yelling, Give me lust, baby.
<p>
Flash.
<p>
Give me malice.
<p>
Flash.
<p>
Give me detached existentialist ennui.
<p>
Flash.
<p>
Give me rampant intellectualism as a coping mechanism.
<p>
Flash.
<p>
Probably it's the shock of seeing my one worst enemy shoot my other worst enemy is what it is. Boom, and it's a win-win situation. This and being around Brandy, I've developed a pretty big jones for drama.
<p>
It only looks like I'm crying when I put a handkerchief up under my veil to breathe through. To filter the air since you can about not breathe for all the smoke since Evie's big manor house is burning down around us.
<p>
Me, kneeling down beside Brandy, I could put my hands anywhere in my gown and find Darvons and Demerols and Darvocet 100s. This is everybody's cue to look at me. My gown is a knock-off print of the Shroud of Turin, most of it brown and white, draped and cut so the shiny red buttons will button through the stigmata. Then I'm wearing yards and yards of black organza veil wrapped around my face and studded with little hand-cut Austrian crystal stars. You can't tell how I look, face-wise, but that's the whole idea. The look is elegant and sacrilegious and makes me feel sacred and immoral. 
<p>
Haute couture and getting hauter.
<p>
Fire inches down the foyer wallpaper. Me, for added set dressing I started the fire. Special effects can go a long way to heighten a mood, and it's not as if this is a real house. What's burning down is a re-creation of a period revival house patterned after a copy of a copy of a copy of a mock-Tudor big manor house. It's a hundred generations removed from anything original, but the truth is aren't we all? 
<p>
Just before Evie comes screaming down the stairs and shoots Brandy Alexander, what I did was pour out about a gallon of Chanel Number Five and put a burning wedding invitation to it, and boom, I'm recycling.
<p>
It's funny, but when you think about even the biggest tragic fire it's just a sustained chemical reaction. The oxidation of Joan of Arc.
<p>
Still spinning on the floor, the rifle points at me, points at Brandy.
<p>
Another thing is no matter how much you think you love somebody, you'll step back when the pool of their blood edges up too close.
<p>
Except for all this high drama, it's a really nice day. This is a warm, sunny day and the front door is open to the porch and the lawn outside. The fire upstairs draws the warm smell of the fresh-cut lawn into the foyer, and you can hear all the wedding guests outside. All the guests, they took the gifts they wanted, the crystal and silver and went out to wait on the lawn for the firemen and paramedics to make their entrance.
<p>
Brandy, she opens one of her huge, ring-beaded hands and she touches the hole pouring her blood all over the marble floor.
<p>
Brandy, she says, "Shit. There's no way the Bon MarchZ will take this suit back."
<p>
Evie lifts her face, her face a finger-painting mess of soot and snot and tears from her hands and screams, "I hate my life being so boring!"
<p>
Evie screams down at Brandy Alexander, "Save me a window table in hell!"
<p>
Tears rinse clean lines down Evie's cheeks, and she screams, "Girlfriend! You need to be yelling some back at me!"
<p>
As if this isn't already drama, drama, drama, Brandy looks up at me kneeling beside her. Brandy's aubergine eyes dilated out to full flower, she says, "Brandy Alex-ander is going to die now?"
<p>
Evie, Brandy and me, all this is just a power struggle for the spotlight. Just each of us being me, me, me first. The murderer, the victim, the witness, each of us thinks our role is the lead.
<p>
Probably that goes for anybody in the world.
<p>
It's all <I>mirror, mirror on the wall</I> because beauty is power the same way money is power the same way a gun is power.
<p>
Anymore, when I see the picture of a twenty-something in the newspaper who was abducted and sodomized and robbed and then killed and here's a front-page picture of her young and smiling, instead of me dwelling on this being a big, sad crime, my gut reaction is, wow, she'd be really hot if she didn't have such a big honker of a nose. My second reaction is I'd better have some good head and shoulders shots handy in case I get, you know, abducted and sodomized to death. My third reaction is, well, at least that cuts down on the competition.
<p>
If that's not enough, my moisturizer I use is a suspension of inert fetal solids in hydrogenated mineral oil. My point is that, if I'm honest, my life is all about me.
<p>
My point is, unless the meter is running and some photographer is yelling: Give me empathy.
<p>
Then the flash of the strobe.
<p>
Give me sympathy.
<p>
Flash.
<p>
Give me brutal honesty.
<p>
Flash.
<p>
"Don't let me die here on this floor," Brandy says, and her big hands clutch at me. "My hair," she says, "My hair will be flat in the back."
<p>
My point is I know Brandy is maybe probably going to die, but I just can't get into it.
Evie sobs even louder. On top of this, the fire sirens from way outside are crowning me queen of Migraine Town.
<p>
The rifle is still spinning on the floor, but slower and slower.
<p>
Brandy says, "This is not how Brandy Alexander wanted her life to go. She's supposed to be famous, first. You know, she's supposed to be on television during Super Bowl halftime, drinking a diet cola naked in slow motion before she died."
<p>
The rifle stops spinning and points at nobody.
<p>
At Evie sobbing, Brandy screams, "Shut up!"
<p>
"<I>You</I> shut up," Evie screams back. Behind her, the fire is eating its way down the stairway carpet.
<p>
The sirens, you can hear them wandering and screaming all over the West Hills. People will just knock each other down to dial 9-1-1 and be the big hero. Nobody looks ready for the big television crew that's due to arrive any minute.
<p>
"This is your last chance, honey," Brandy says, and her blood is getting all over the place. She says, "Do you love me?"
<p>
It's when folks ask questions like this that you lose the spotlight.
<p>
This is how folks trap you into a best-supporting role.
<p>
Even bigger than the house being on fire is this huge expectation that I have to say the three most worn-out words you'll find in any script. Just the words make me feel I'm severely fingering myself. They're just words is all. Powerless. Vocabulary. Dialogue.
<p>
"Tell me," Brandy says. "Do you? Do you really love me?"
<p>
This is the big hammy way Brandy has played her whole life. The Brandy Alexander nonstop continuous live action theater, but less and less live by the moment.
<p>
Just for a little stage business, I take Brandy's hand in mine. This is a nice gesture, but then I'm freaked by the whole threat of blood-borne pathogens, and then, boom, the ceiling in the dining room crashes down and sparks and embers rush out at us from the dining room doorway.
<p>
"Even if you can't love me, then tell me my life," Brandy says. "A girl can't die without her life flashing before her eyes."
<p>
Pretty much nobody is getting their emotional needs met.
<p>
It's then the fire eats down the stairway carpet to Evie's bare ass, and Evie screams to her feet and pounds down the stairs in her burned-up white high heels. Naked and hairless, wearing wire and ashes, Evie Cottrell runs out the front door to a larger audience, her wedding guests, the silver and crystal and the arriving fire trucks. This is the world we live in. Conditions change and we mutate. 
<p>
So of course this'll be all about Brandy, hosted by me, with guest appearances by Evelyn Cottrell and the deadly AIDS virus. Brandy, Brandy, Brandy. Poor sad Brandy on her back, Brandy touches the hole pouring her life out onto the marble floor and says, "Please. Tell me my life. Tell me how we got here."
<p>
So me, I'm here eating smoke just to document this Brandy Alexander moment.
<p>
Give me attention.
<p>
Flash.
<p>
Give me adoration.
<p>
Flash.
<p>
Give me a break.
<p>
Flash.
