											This who-done-it begins with the murder of a controversial talk show host in his own broadcast studio room. The author takes three friends on a roller coaster ride of suspicion, fear, secrecy, and paranoia. First there is the question of whether Jim Fate's death was an act of terrorism or premeditated homicide. If the former, what group would commit such a horrendous act? Or is it more likely the latter, as those offended by his broadcast opinions could form a line around the city; perhaps twice over? The prosecuting attorney, the FBI agent, and the crime reporter set their course to uncover the truth. Little did they know their journey would take them on a dangerous journey of discovery beyond the act itself, revealing a motive none of the friends (nor this reader) predicted.<p/><p/>Wiehl's story took place in the city of Portland, Oregon; of which I'm well familiar. The places and details were spot on, increasing my enjoyment of the author's work. Although initially apprehensive about reading a crime novel, I found I could not put this down. Hand of Fate was truly spell-binding from start to finish!</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Hand of Fate<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=mom2zqb">mom2zqb</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-2"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1410027_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781595547064_BK_1_1410027" href="#previewReview_1410027" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 24, 2010: 
											Hand of Fate is the second installment in the Triple Threat series.  It was easy to follow the three friends and colleagues as they worked to solve the murder of an out spoken radio talk show host.  I didn't feel like I was missing out having not read the first book in the series.  While the plot was good I feel that the story moved too slow.   I would recommend this book but beware the beginning is slow. <p/><p/> <p/><p/>I am a Thomas Nelson Book Sneeze Blogger and this book was provided to me at no charge for a review.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P><P>When the host of a popular radio talk show is murdered, the suspects almost outnumber his millions of listeners.

In the ensuing panic, police evacuate downtown Portland &#8211; and the triple threat of FBI Special Agent Nicole Hedges, crime reporter Cassidy Shaw, and Federal Prosecutor Allison Pierce begin piecing together the madness, motive, and mystery of what just happened. And this time, it&#8217;s personal since one of the women was secretly dating the host and has access to his home&#8230;as well as possible evidence. In the days following Fate&#8217;s murder, these three colleagues and friends confront a betrayal within the team while unearthing the not-so-public life of Jim Fate. Together, they must uncover the stunning truths of who killed him, how close the killer really is, and the twisted motive for this cold-blooded murder.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Bestseller Wiehl and Henry's second Triple Threat novel (after Face of Betrayal) offers an exciting if familiar plot.

He  leaned forward, his lips nearly touching the silver mesh of the mike.  <p>     "Can massive federal spending and a huge new layer of government  bureaucracy really make the United States a better, safer place?  Or is it a matter of simply enforcing the food safety laws the states  already have on the books? For more than a century, our food safety  system has been built on the policy that food companies-not government-have  the primary responsibility for the safety and integrity  of the foods they produce."  <p>     "So what are you suggesting, Jim?" Victoria Hanawa, his cohost,  asked. "Are you saying we just let more Americans die when they buy  food a company couldn't bother to keep clean?"  <p>     She sat on a high stool on the other side of the U-shaped table,  her back to the glass wall that separated the radio studio from the  screener's booth. To Jim's right was the control room, sometimes  called the news tank, where the board operator worked his bank of  equipment and where one or more local reporters joined him at the  top and the bottom of the hour.  <p>     "What I'm saying, Hanawa, is that activists are seizing the latest  salmonella scare to further their own goals of increasing the power of  the federal government. They don't really care about these people.  They only care about their own agenda, which is to create a nanny  state full of burdensome, unworkable, and costly regulation. And of  course the federal government, being the federal government, believes  that the only solution to any problem is adding another layer-or  ten-of federal government."  <p>     While he spoke, Jim eyed the two screens in front of him. One displayed  the show schedule. It was also hooked up to the Internet so he  could look up points on the fly. The other screen showed the listeners  holding for their chance to talk. On it, Chris had listed the name, town,  and point of view of each caller. Three people were still on the list,  meaning they would hold over the upcoming break. Now a fourth caller  and a fifth joined the queue.  <p>     "What about the Tenth Amendment? There are state laws already  in place to address these issues! We don't need to add a whole new  layer of government bureaucracy that could end up doubling or even  tripling food prices! I mean, that would be stuck on stupid."  <p>     "But the food industry in this country is putting profits before  safety," Victoria protested.  <p>     "With all due respect, Hanawa, if we let the federal government  handle it, they will insist that everyone who buys anything at a grocery  store sign a release form and be issued their very own government-approved  barf bag. Just another example of disenfranchisement."  <p>     Victoria's mouth started to form an answer, but it was time for the  top-of-the-hour break. Chris pointed at the clock and then made a  motion with his hands like he was snapping a stick.  <p>     Jim said, "And you've been listening to <i>The Hand of Fate</i>. We're  going to take a quick break for a news, traffic, and weather update. But  before we go, I want to read you the e-mail from the Nut of the Day&#58;  'Jim, you are a fat, ugly liar who resembles the hind end of a poodle.  Signed, Mickey Mouse.'"  <p>     He laughed, shielding himself from the sting. In this business, you  knew that words <i>could</i> hurt you. Even if you were only forty-one and  in good shape, with the kind of traditional broody Irish looks that  made most women look twice.  <p>     "Fat? Maybe. Ugly? Well, I can't help that. I can't even help the  hind-end-of-a-poodle business, although I think that's going a bit far.  But a liar? No, my friend, that's one thing I am not. While I'll give this  a pass today, you'll need to get a little more creative than that if you  want to win the NOD award. And America's Truth Detector will be  right back in a moment to hear from you." He pushed back the mike  on its black telescoping arm.  <p>     As the first notes of the newscast jingle sounded in his ears, Jim  pulled the padded black headphones down around his neck. He and  Victoria now had six minutes to themselves before the third and final  hour of the broadcast.  <p>     "I'm going to get some tea," she said, without meeting his eyes.  Jim nodded. In the last week, there had been a strained civility  between them when they were off mike. On air, though, they still  had chemistry. Even if now it was the kind of chemistry you got  from mixing together the wrong chemicals in your junior scientist  kit.  <p>     On air, everything was different. Jim was more indignant and  mocking than he ever was in real life. Victoria made vaguely dirty  jokes that she wouldn't tolerate hearing off mike. And on air, they still  mostly got along, bantering and feeding each other lines.  <p>     Victoria grabbed her mug and stood up. Even though she was half  Japanese, she was five foot ten, with legs that went on forever. Handing  him a padded envelope from a publisher, she said, "This was in my  box this morning, but it's really yours."  <p>     When she pushed open the heavy door to the screening room, the  weather strip on the bottom made a sucking sound. For a minute, Jim  could hear Chris in the screener's booth talking to Willow, the intern,  and Aaron, the program director. Then the door closed with a snick-there  were magnets on the door and frame-and Jim was left in the  silent bubble of the studio. In addition to the magnets and the weather  stripping, the walls and ceiling were covered with blue, textured  soundproofing material that resembled the loop side of Velcro.  <p>     Jim grabbed the first piece of mail from his in-box and slit it with  a letter opener. He scanned the note inside. "Dad's seventy-fifth birthday  ... love to have a signed photo," yada yada.  <p>     "Happy Birthday, Larry!" he scrawled on a black-and-white  headshot he pulled from dozens kept in a file folder. "Your friend,  Jim Fate." Paper-clipping the envelope and letter to the photo, he put  them off to the side for Willow to handle. Three more photo requests,  each of which took about twenty seconds to deal with. Jim had signed  his name so many times in the last ten years that it was routine, but  he still got a secret thrill each time he did it.  <p>     There were still about three minutes left, so he decided to open  the package from the publisher. He liked books about true crime,  politics, or culture-with authors he could book on the show.  <p>     Jim pulled the red string tab on the envelope. It got stuck halfway  through, and he had to give it an extra hard tug. There was an odd  hissing sound as a paperback-<i>Talk Radio</i>-fell onto his lap. A book  of a play turned into a movie-both based on the true-life killing of  talk show host Alan Berg, gunned down in his own driveway.  <p>     <i>What the-?</i>  <p>     Jim never finished the thought. The red string had been connected  to a small canister of gas hidden in the envelope. Now it sprayed  directly into his face.  <p>     He gasped. With just that first breath, Jim knew something was  terribly wrong. He couldn't see the gas, couldn't smell it, but he could  feel its damp fog coat the inside of his nose and throat.  <p>     He swept the package away. It landed behind him, in the far corner  of the studio. Whatever it was, it was in the air. So he shouldn't  breathe. Jim clamped his lips together and scrambled to his feet,  yanking off the headphones.  <p>     It was just like what had happened in Seattle three weeks earlier.  Fifty-eight people had died from sarin gas in what seemed to be a  botched terrorist attack.  <p>     His chest already starting to ache, Jim looked out through the thick,  glass wall into the control room on his right. Greg, the board operator,  was half-turned away, gobbling a PayDay bar. He was watching his  banks of equipment, ready to press the buttons for commercials and  national feeds. In the call screener's booth directly in front of Jim, Aaron  was still talking to Chris and Willow, waving his hands for emphasis.  Jim was unnoticed, sealed away in his bubble.  <p>     He forced himself to concentrate. He had to get some air, some  fresh air. If he staggered out, would the air there be enough to dilute  what he had already breathed in? Would it be enough to clear the  sarin from his lungs, from his body?  <p>     Would it be enough to save him?  <p>     But if he opened the door, what would happen to the people out  there? Chris, Willow, Aaron, and the rest? He thought of the firefighters  who had died in Seattle. Would invisible tendrils of poison snake  out to the dozens of people who worked at the station, the hundreds  who worked in the building? Greg in the control room, with its own  soundproofing, might be safe if he kept his door closed. For a while,  anyway. Until it got into the air ducts. Some of the people who died in  Seattle had been nowhere near the original release of the gas. If Jim  tried to escape, everyone out there might die too.  <p>     <i>Die too.</i> The words echoed in his head. Jim realized that he <i>was</i>  dying, that he had been dying from the moment he first sucked in his  breath in surprise. It had been, he thought, somewhere between fifteen  and twenty seconds since the gas sprayed into his face.  <p>     Every morning, Jim swam two miles at the MAC club. He could  hold his breath for two minutes. How long had that magician done it  on <i>Oprah</i>? Seventeen minutes, wasn't that it? Jim couldn't hold his  breath for that long, but he was sure he could hold it longer than two  minutes. Maybe a lot longer. The first responders could surely get  him some oxygen. The line might be thin enough to snake under the  closed door.  <p>     Jim pressed the Talk button and spoke in a slurred, breathy voice.  "Sarin gas! Call 911 and go! Don't open door!"  <p>     They all swung around to look at him in surprise. Without getting  any closer, he pointed to the package in the corner.  <p>     Chris sprang into action with the catlike reflexes of someone who  worked in live radio-someone used to dealing with crazies and  obscenity spouters before their words got out on the airwaves and  brought down a big fine from the FCC. He punched numbers into the  phone and began shouting their address to the 911 operator. He'd  pressed the Talk button, so Jim heard every word.  <p>     "It's sarin gas. Yes, sarin! In the KNWS studio! Hurry! It's killing  him! It's killing Jim Fate!"  <p>     Behind Chris, Willow took one look at Jim, her eyes wide, and  turned and ran out of the studio.  <p>     In the news tank, Greg backed away from the window. But in the  screener's booth, Aaron moved toward the door with an outstretched  hand. Jim staggered forward and held the door closed with his foot. His  gaze met Aaron's through the small rectangle of glass set in the door at  eye level.  <p>     "Are you sure? Jim, come out of there!"  <p>     Jim knew Aaron was yelling, but the door filtered it into a low  murmur, stripped of all urgency.  <p>     He couldn't afford the breath it would take to speak, couldn't  afford to open his mouth in case he accidentally sucked in air again.  His body was already demanding that he stop this nonsense and  breathe. All he could do was shake his head, his lips clamped together.  <p>     Chris pressed the Talk button again. "They're sending a hazmat  team. They should be here any second. They said they're bringing  oxygen."  <p>     Jim made a sweeping motion with his hands, wordlessly ordering  his coworkers to leave. His chest was aching. Greg grabbed a board  and a couple of microphones and left the news tank at a run. Aaron  took one last look at Jim, shook his head, and then left. A second later,  the fire alarm began to sound, a low pulse muffled to near nothingness  by the soundproof door.        Chris stayed where he was, staring at Jim through the glass. The  two of them had been together for years. Every morning, Chris and  Jim-and more recently Victoria-got in early and put the show  together, scouring the newspaper, the Internet, and TV clips for stories  that would light up the lines.  <p>     "I'm praying for you, man," Chris said, then released the Talk button.  He gave Jim one more anguished look, then hurried out.  <p>     Jim wished he could follow. But he couldn't run away from what  the poison had already done to him. His vision blurred. Time was  slowing down. He was so tired. Why did he have to hold his breath,  again? Oh yes, sarin.  <p>     When he looked back up, he saw that Victoria was still in the  screener's room. She moved close to the glass, her dark eyes seeking  out Jim's. Angrily, he shook his head and motioned for her to go.  <p>     Victoria pressed the Talk button. "I don't smell anything out here.  The booth is practically airtight, anyway."  <p>     Jim wanted to tell her that "practically" wasn't the same as really  and truly. It was the kind of argument they might have on air during  a slow time, bantering to keep things moving along. But he didn't  have the breath for it.  <p>     A part of Jim's brain remained coldly rational even as his body  sent more and more messages that something was badly wrong. He  hadn't breathed since that first fateful gulp of air when he opened the  package. A vacuum was building up in his head and chest, a sucking  hollowness, his body screaming at him, demanding that he give in.  <p>     But Jim Fate hadn't made it this far by giving in when things were  tough. It had only been a minute, a minute-ten maybe, since he'd  pulled the red string. But then he did give in to another hunger-the  hunger for connection. He was all alone and he might be dying, and he  couldn't stand that thought. He moved to the glass and put his hand  up against it, fingers spread, a lonely starfish. And then Victoria mirrored  it with her own hand, the anger between them forgotten, their  matching hands pressed against the glass.  <p>     There was a band around Jim's chest, and it was tightening. An  iron band. It was crushing him, crushing his lungs. His vision was  dimming, but he kept his eyes open, his gaze never leaving Victoria.  <p>     With her free hand, Victoria groped blindly for the Talk button.  "Jim, you've got to hold on," she yelled.  <p>     Jim's heart contracted when he heard how hoarse she sounded.  She had to leave!  <p>     He lifted his hand from the glass and made a shooing gesture,  again wordlessly ordering her to leave. Instead she pushed the Talk  button again and said, "I hear sirens. They're almost here!"  <p>     But his body was ready to break with his will. He had to breathe.  Had to. But maybe he could filter it, minimize it.  <p>     Without taking his eyes from Victoria, Jim pulled up the edge of  his shirt with his free hand and pressed his nose and mouth against  the fine Egyptian cotton cloth. He meant to take a shallow breath, but  when he started, the hunger for air was too great. He sucked it in  greedily, the cloth touching his tongue as he inhaled.  <p>     He sensed the shoots of poison winding themselves deeper within  him, reaching out to wrap around all his organs. His head felt like it  was going to explode.  <p>     No longer thinking clearly, Jim let his shirttail fall away. It didn't  matter, did it? It was too late. Too late. He tried to take another breath,  but his lungs refused to move.  <p>     He staggered backward. Grabbed at his chair and missed. Fell over.  <p>     Horrified, Victoria started screaming. A shiver ran through Jim's  body, his arms and legs twitching. And then Jim Fate was still. His  eyes, still open, stared up at the soft, fuzzy blue ceiling.  <p>     Two minutes later the first hazmat responders, suited up in white,  burst through the studio door.  <p>  <p>  <H4> Chapter Two </H4>  <b><i>Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse</i></b>  <p>  <p>  Federal prosecutor Allison Pierce eyed the 150 prospective jurors as  they filed into the sixteenth-floor courtroom in the Mark O. Hatfield  United States Courthouse. A high-profile case like this necessitated a  huge jury pool.  <p>     The seats soon filled, forcing dozens to stand, some only a few  inches from the prosecution table. Allison could smell unwashed bodies  and unbrushed teeth. She swallowed hard, forcing down the nausea  that now plagued her at unexpected moments.  <p>     "Are you all right?" FBI special agent Nicole Hedges whispered.  Nicole was sitting next to Allison at the prosecutor's table. Her huge,  dark eyes never missed anything.  <p>     "These days, I'm either nauseated or ravenous," Allison whispered  back. "Sometimes at the same time."  <p>     "Maybe the Triple Threat Club can find someplace to meet that  serves ice cream and pickles."  <p>     The club was an inside joke, just three friends with connections to  law enforcement-Allison, Nicole, and TV crime reporter Cassidy  Shaw-who were devoted to justice, friendship, and chocolate. Not  necessarily in that order.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>HAND OF FATE</b> by <b>LIS WIEHL  APRIL HENRY</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Lis Wiehl and April Henry.
