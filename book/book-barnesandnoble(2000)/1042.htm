</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Benjamin draws on one of the most enduring relationships in children&rsquo;s literature in her excellent debut, spinning out the heartbreaking story of Alice from Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland. Her research into the lives of Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) and the family of Alice Liddell is apparent as she takes circumstances shrouded in mystery and colors in the spaces to reveal a vibrant and passionate Alice. Born into a Victorian family of privilege, free-spirited Alice catches the attention of family friend Dodgson and serves as the muse for both his photography and writing. Their bond, however, is misunderstood by Alice&rsquo;s family, and though she is forced to sever their friendship, she is forever haunted by their connection as her life becomes something of a chain of heartbreaks. As an adult, Alice tries to escape her past, but it is only when she finally embraces it that she truly finds the happiness that eluded her. Focusing on three eras in Alice&rsquo;s life, Benjamin offers a finely wrought portrait of Alice that seamlessly blends fact with fiction. This is book club gold. (Jan.)

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Samantha Eggar is a consummate actor, and the character of Alice Liddell Hargreaves, from girlhood into old age, is a great vehicle for her talents. The three young Liddell sisters who dominate the first half of the book are easily distinguished and thoroughly believable. So are their parents and the shy, stuttering Oxford professor Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), who entertains the girls with long, highly imaginative stories. Romance, mystery, and tragedy soon erupt in the life of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Alice; fans of the classic and of smart, atmospheric contemporary fiction will find much to relish. A Delacorte hardcover (Reviews, Oct. 12). (Jan.)</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>In this historical novel about the real-life Alice in Alice in Wonderland, 80-year-old Alice Hargreaves looks back on three periods of her life&#58; her Victorian childhood as the daughter of an Oxford don and the special friend of mathematics tutor Charles Dodgson, later known as Lewis Carroll; her young adult romance with Prince Leopold and its painful conclusion; and her marriage to country gentleman Reginald Hargreaves and the raising of their three sons, who eventually face the horrors of World War I. Throughout it all, Alice is burdened by her fictional identity and by having captivated the odd, stuttering Mr. Dodgson as a child. The jealousy and rumors caused by his intense fondness for Alice besmirch both their reputations for years to come. VERDICT Benjamin's novel imagines the truth behind the mystery of Lewis Carroll's relationship with his child muse, Alice Liddell. Although the shadow of inappropriateness always lingers, this is truly a love story, albeit one that could happily exist only in a fairy tale. This novel will have wide appeal as it includes history, romance, literature, and a great deal of suspense. [See Prepub Alert, LJ 9/1/09.]&mdash;Joy Humphrey, Pepperdine Univ. Law Lib., Malibu, CA
</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p>Adult/High School&mdash;In this novel, Benjamin examines the life of Alice Liddell Hargreaves, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Alice. As she explains, Alice and her sisters are the "princesses" of Oxford and are expected to act in a manner befitting nobility. At the age of seven, Alice Liddell develops a close, intimate relationship with Charles Dodgson, an instructor at Oxford, who will go on to publish as Lewis Carroll. She serves as his muse until the age of 11, when one summer day an inappropriate encounter is witnessed by her sister. Alice's relationship with Dodgson and the rumors that follow her will cast a shadow over the rest of her life, costing her a relationship with Prince Leopold and the chance to become a real princess. Benjamin has researched the facts of Alice's and Dodgson's lives and filled in blanks, including what really happened between Alice and Dodgson to cause an irreparable rift between them. The author weaves these facts and her additions into an engaging and moving story of childhood obsession, adolescent dreams, and the realities of adult life. Alice's feelings about being the real-life version of a childhood literary icon are explored in an in-depth manner both from the perspective of her teen years and during her life as a wife and mother. This is a beautiful story for readers interested in the fictionalized life of a literary inspiration.&mdash;Laura Amos, Newport News Public Library, VA
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Benjamin's debut imagines Alice Liddell's experiences before and particularly after Lewis Carroll immortalized her. She was born in 1852, daughter of the dean of Christ Church College, Oxford; she died in 1934, at the height of the Great Depression. But Alice's life reached its literary apex in 1862, when on a summer afternoon Oxford mathematics don Charles Dodgson entertained the Liddell sisters with a tale of Alice falling down the rabbit's hole, later to be the inaugural event in his hugely successful book, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. This well-documented afternoon and the girl's charged relationship with Dodgson are described by the author as defining experiences for Alice, both magical and traumatic, overshadowing the subsequent 70 years. Benjamin's adult Alice grapples with a repressed memory; her one-dimensional Dodgson is a daydreaming, stuttering loser. The relationship offered here, that of a pedophile and his victim, is too predictable and simplistic; the sexual mores of Victorian England and of Dodgson himself were more complicated. The novel becomes richer and increasingly assured after the "break," when Dodgson is forbidden to see Alice again. She grows to maturity in Oxford's culturally privileged enclave, is wooed by Queen Victoria's son, Prince Leopold (barred from marrying her in part because of the unspoken, lingering scandal concerning Dodgson), then finally marries and bears three boys, two of them killed in World War I. In the end, this rigid Victorian lady, at a loss in the 20th century, recovers her memory and finally finds what her life has lacked-acceptance and self-love. Historical fiction hampered by a 21st-century perspective on Victorian values.

Now, in this spellbinding historical novel, we meet the young girl whose bright spirit sent her on an unforgettable trip down the rabbit hole&ndash;and the grown woman whose story is no less enthralling.<br><br>The questions and discussion topics that follow are intended to enhance your reading of Melanie Benjamin&rsquo;s <b>Alice I Have Been</b>.
<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P><i>Chapter Twelve</i><br><br><br>You look lovely&mdash;that rose tulle over the tarlatan is&#160;perfection! Oh, I do wish I was going!&rdquo; Covering her face with&#160;her handkerchief, Edith coughed fitfully and then fell back&#160;against her pillows, her hair a tangled mess of curls. Her face was&#160;nearly as red as her hair.<br><br>&#160;&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;d be a perfect vision, with all that coughing! I know&#160;it&rsquo;s unfair, and Aubrey will be vexed, but you know what Dr.&#160;Acland said. You&rsquo;re to stay in bed for a week, at least.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so unlucky! And for once I thought I&rsquo;d be the belle of the&#160;ball instead of you! Papa was going to announce the engagement&#160;tonight.&rdquo; Edith smiled weakly, and turned her head to sigh over&#160;the beautiful blue taffeta gown hanging in the cupboard.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never the belle of the ball when you&rsquo;re present, so I relish&#160;the chance tonight. May I borrow your diamond star clip for&#160;my hair?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, of course&mdash;it&rsquo;ll look wonderful with your diamond&#160;earrings!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>I smiled my thanks and rummaged around in her jewel case&#160;until I found the clip; dancing over to the looking glass above the&#160;mantel, I pinned it in my hair, just above my left ear. &ldquo;Is this&#160;right, do you think?&rdquo; I turned.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect. Oh dear!&rdquo; And Edith was off on another coughing&#160;fit again.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Poor darling! I&rsquo;ll ring for the nurse&mdash;Dr. Acland said we&#160;weren&rsquo;t to get too close, in case it&rsquo;s measles. I do wish Icould&#160;give you a kiss, though, before I fly. I&rsquo;m rather excited for&#160;tonight&mdash;silly, but I am! How many Commemoration Balls have&#160;I attended? &rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;None like tonight,&rdquo; Edith managed to choke out, between&#160;coughs. Finally they subsided, and she fell back against her&#160;pillows once more. &ldquo;Do you think the Prince will propose,&#160;then?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know, but perhaps he&mdash;might.&rdquo; I was too superstitious&#160;to say more, even if I could not stop myself from smiling&#160;in anticipation. We had made so many plans in these last few&#160;days, as his time at Oxford drew to an end; some were quite unattainable&#160;(I doubted, for instance, that the Queen would countenance&#160;Leo&rsquo;s idea of moving to America in order to organize the&#160;recently emancipated slaves into helping the British recapture&#160;the colonies), but others more down to earth. I knew he had also&#160;spoken to Papa. Yet there remained the matter of obtaining the&#160;Queen&rsquo;s permission, and I had not been able to ask if he had written&#160;her.&#160;<br><br>Still, I sensed it, my future; it was close, so close I could wrap&#160;my arms around it; wrap my arms around <i>him</i>. Perhaps, tonight,&#160;he would simply waltz me out of Oxford, right under everyone&rsquo;s&#160;noses.&#160;<br><br>Giggling, I began to waltz around Edith&rsquo;s room, holding my&#160;skirts up, showing off my new silk dancing slippers. Edith giggled,&#160;too&mdash;as best she could&mdash;but when she began to cough&#160;again, I stopped.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m making you much worse! I&rsquo;ll finish my toilette in&#160; my own room. You rest now, darling, and I&rsquo;ll save you a program<i>&#160;</i>and tell you all the gossip in the morning.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, I do wish I could go!&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t help but shed a&#160;tear, even as she beamed at me from the depths of her pillows,&#160;looking like a dyspeptic angel in her white nightgown. &ldquo;Keep&#160;Aubrey company! And I can&rsquo;t wait to congratulate you in the&#160;morning!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; I blew her a kiss, then hurried out of her room,&#160;shutting the door softly behind me. Downstairs, outside the front&#160;door, I could hear Bultitude stomping his feet and grumbling; the&#160;carriage must have arrived. Where on earth was Sophie? She was&#160;supposed to have brought down my gloves and wrap ten minutes&#160;ago. I headed back to my room to retrieve them myself; I did&#160;hope she had remembered to dress in her good black silk, and&#160;pack her needle and thread in case I needed repairs later.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alice!&rdquo; Mamma was gliding down the hall, handsome in her&#160;new ruby red silk gown, the bustle a cascade of white satin ruffles&#160;dotted with black velvet bows.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, Mamma?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I need to talk with you before we leave.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;About what, Mamma?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;This business with Prince Leopold. Your father spoke to me&#160;about it this evening.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;He did?&rdquo; Perhaps Leo had heard from the Queen, then? I&#160;couldn&rsquo;t hide my hope; I couldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t, stop myself from&#160;beaming, even as I blinked away a surprising tear of joy.&#160;Mamma, however, pretended not to notice, as she merely&#160;sniffed before continuing. &ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s a fool, your father. He&rsquo;s&#160;blinded by his affection for the Prince. But he does not view the&#160;situation with clear eyes.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; My eyes were dry now. I met my mother&rsquo;s gaze directly.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;And you do?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, I do. Despite what you believe, I do.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;What I believe? I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;I believe that you cannot view&#160;the situation with anything but jaded eyes, Mamma. I believe that&#160;you cannot look at me without seeing&mdash;without seeing what you&#160;want to see, which is that I&rsquo;m not good enough for a prince. Confess&#160;it, Mamma. Confess that you think that Leo is too good for&#160;me.&rdquo; My voice was rising, the back of my neck was bristling, just&#160;like an animal engaged in mortal combat, but I did not care. Finally,&#160;I would make my mother look at me, talk to me, treat me&#160;as an equal&mdash;even if it was by challenging her to speak a truth I&#160;did not want to hear.&#160;<br><br>Her dark eyes glittered, even as her eyebrows shot up in their&#160;triangular way, and I think she admired me, in spite of herself;&#160;she knew so few true adversaries. Still, she shook her head dismissively.&#160;&ldquo;I know the world in a way which you do not. I know&#160;the Queen. I know there might&mdash;there will be inquiries. But instead&#160;of accusing me of thinking less of you, have you ever&#160;thought that I might be protecting you? Protecting your heart&#160;from getting hurt? I once thought you the most practical of my&#160;daughters, Alice, but now I wonder. You seem so desperate&#160;lately. So reckless.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Why was it, whenever I tried to shape my own destiny, I was&#160;considered to be acting recklessly? Was that the fate of the unmarried&#160;woman? I had to believe it was so. &ldquo;Well, then, I <i>am </i>desperate!&#160;And if that makes me reckless, so be it! I&rsquo;m desperately in&#160;love, I&rsquo;m desperate to get away from here&mdash;I&rsquo;m twenty-four,&#160;Mamma! Twenty-four! I should be married, I should have a&#160;home of my own, but I&rsquo;ve been kept out of sight, put up on a&#160;shelf. And Leo found me there, and rescued me! I know something<i>&#160;</i>about the world, too&mdash;give me some credit, at least. I&rsquo;ve&#160;taken measures to protect myself.&rdquo; I thought of Mr. Ruskin, that&#160;last horrible day in his drawing room, and I shuddered.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alice.&rdquo; My mother&rsquo;s face softened; her eyes shone with what&#160;I could almost believe was understanding. I remembered that&#160;long-ago winter before Albert came, when she had asked for me,&#160;and only me, to keep her company; I had seen that same expression&#160;in her eyes then. Although never since. &ldquo;Alice, I do wish for&#160;you to be happy. I wish for you to have your own family, your&#160;own home like Ina, like Edith will soon. I merely wish that you&#160;and Leopold&mdash;tell me this, Alice. Do you truly think <i>he&rsquo;ll </i>keep&#160;quiet? Do you truly think he &rsquo;ll stand by and not say a word,&#160;while you plan to marry another man, particularly a prince?&rdquo;&#160;Her mouth twisted up, as if she couldn&rsquo;t bear to even think of&#160;him, and I knew she was referring to Mr. Dodgson now.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll want me to be happy,&rdquo; I answered defiantly, speaking&#160;what was in my heart, for it was what I truly wished for him.&#160;&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Mamma raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a bigger&#160;fool than I took you for.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>The words stung, like a slap across my face&mdash;had she called&#160;me ugly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded, but I realized I had long set a&#160;great store in the fact that Mamma thought me sensible&mdash;but I&#160;would not let her see my pain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you in the carriage in a&#160;moment, Mamma. I must find Sophie first.&rdquo; Without meeting her&#160;gaze, I brushed past her and headed to my room.&#160;<br><br>Before I reached the door, I heard her say, once, &ldquo;Alice.&rdquo; It&#160;was not a command; it was more like a prayer. A mother&rsquo;s prayer?&#160;I wondered. I could not know, for I had never once heard my&#160;mother ask God for anything. I ignored her and entered my&#160;room, shutting the door behind me.&#160;<i><br><br></i>I found Sophie sitting like an obedient child at my dressing&#160;table; I told her to hand me my wrap and gloves, and to try, for&#160;pity&rsquo;s sake, not to crush my nosegay on the drive to the ball.&#160;Then I ran to the mirror for one more look&mdash;had I ever stared at&#160;myself more than I had this evening? Holding my reflection in&#160;my gaze, I forced myself to shake off the effects of Mamma&rsquo;s&#160;words; I slowed my breathing down, felt my cheeks lose some of&#160;their heat, blinked my eyes so the tears would not fall. I tried to&#160;recapture the giddy joy I had felt in Edith&rsquo;s room; but I knew I&#160;would not recover it except in Leo&rsquo;s arms.&#160;<br><br>Suddenly I could wait for him no longer; I ran from the room,&#160;Sophie struggling behind, and flew down the stairs, scarcely bothering&#160;to wrap my shoulders in my cloak. Joining Rhoda, Aubrey&#160;Harcourt&mdash;looking very pale and morose without Edith&mdash;and&#160;my parents in the carriage, I leaned forward as we rumbled away,&#160;as if I could will the horses to fly. Mercifully, the journey was&#160;short. In no time we drew up to the entrance of the new Corn Exchange&#160;behind the Town Hall, where the Oxford Commemoration&#160;Ball of 1876 was being held.&#160;<br><br>I had to fight off the urge&mdash;truly, it pulsed through me like a&#160;fever&mdash;to run out of the carriage, calling Leo&rsquo;s name.&#160;Instead, I demurely walked down the steps, the folds of my&#160;dress gathered in my clenched hands, and followed my parents&#160;into the building, waiting to be announced, one more time,&#160;as &ldquo;Miss Alice Liddell, daughter of the Dean and Mrs. Liddell.&rdquo;&#160;&ldquo;your royal highness, I believe many young ladies are staring&#160;at you, hoping against hope that you will sign their program&#160;for even one turn about the floor.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Are they? I have no idea, for I cannot look at anyone but<i>&#160;</i>you.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;You will tire of that someday, you know,&rdquo; I teased, not believing&#160;my own words. &ldquo;You will look back upon the days when&#160;you could have danced with any number of young ladies with&#160;longing, and possibly regret.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re talking of yourself, after all! Now, &rsquo;fess up,&#160; Alice&#58; You want to dance with one of those hopping young undergraduates&mdash;&#160;see that pack of them, over in the corner, the&#160;ones who look as if they&rsquo;ve borrowed their fathers&rsquo; waistcoats?&mdash;&#160;instead of poor me. You&rsquo;re the one who fears regrets,&#160;not I!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh dear, you&rsquo;ve found me out! I can&rsquo;t hide anything from&#160;you!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Laughing, Leo spun me about&mdash;not quite in step with the&#160;orchestra&mdash;until I grew dizzy, but I didn&rsquo;t mind. Looking up into&#160;his smiling face&mdash;finally he was filling out, so that his cheekbones&#160;weren&rsquo;t so prominent&mdash;I surrendered myself to his sure,&#160;confident embrace as he guided me across the crowded dance&#160;floor. It was such a relief to have him steer me about so; tonight,&#160;I didn&rsquo;t want to think, I didn&rsquo;t want to worry. I wanted only to&#160;laugh, and smile, and dance, and, yes&mdash;perhaps even flirt. But&#160;most of all, I wanted to love, and be loved.&#160;<br><br>And in his arms, feeling the burning imprint of his hand upon&#160;my waist even through the hard shell of my corset, I found not&#160;only the joy I had sought earlier but the realization, without a&#160;doubt, that I was.&#160;<br><br>The Corn Exchange&mdash;normally a huge, drafty place with soaring&#160;ceilings, broad exposed beams, sawdust-covered wood floors&mdash;&#160;had been transformed. Tonight the floors had been scrubbed and polished to a sheen with beeswax; the cavernous walls were hung&#160;with velvet maroon drapes, great gilded brackets holding dripping&#160;candelabras, and bouquets of flowers tucked into swaths of&#160;lace and cord. A very welcome addition was an enormous stack&#160;of ice blocks near the back, which did help cool the room from&#160;the heat of the candles and the warmth of the dancers.&#160;<br><br>While my gown was, naturally, one of the most elegant, there&#160;was no shortage of finery on display. The young ladies wore&#160;gowns of the lightest material&mdash;whispery muslin, delicate lace,&#160;rustling tarlatan, gauzy tulle&mdash;in colors of the gayest spring,&#160;bustles lower this season, more trailing than bunched; the men&#160;were elegantly slim in their close-fitting black trousers, skimming&#160;dress coats to match, showing broad expanses of white&#160;shirtfront studded with diamonds or gold. Naturally, everyone&#160;wore white kid gloves.&#160;<br><br>The ballroom was a feast for the senses&#58; a rainbow of colors&#160;swirling, merging, parting; the beguiling music of the orchestra,&#160;the low, mellow instruments keeping time while the melody&#160;swirled about courtesy of the violins; the honey-sweet aroma of&#160;burning beeswax combined with the hothouse fragrance of a&#160;thousand flowers all mixed together. And hovering above it all&#160;was the rise and fall of ballroom conversation; teasing, taunting,&#160;laughing, occasional serious undertones of earnest lovemaking.&#160;&ldquo;I do love balls.&rdquo; I sighed, content to be simply one fair&#160;maiden among many tonight.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;That is the least profound idea I have ever heard come from&#160;your delectable mouth, and I love you for it.&rdquo; Leo laughed indulgently,&#160;even paternally&mdash;and I allowed him to do so with a bashful,&#160;very maidenlike smile.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Am I too serious for you at times? Would you prefer it if I&#160;only chatted about gloves and bows and parasols instead of<i>&#160;</i>books and art and ideas?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Not at all! I&rsquo;ve spent far too much time in the company of&#160;such perfect ladies&mdash;&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m not a perfect lady?&rdquo; Arching my back, I pulled&#160;slightly away, feigning outrage with a pout.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;oh dear!&rdquo; He began to laugh, helplessly, his slim&#160;shoulders shaking with mirth. &ldquo;This is one of those conversations&#160;which I will never survive. Suffice it to say you&rsquo;re perfect in&#160;every way, and I don&rsquo;t want you to change one whit. There&mdash;am&#160;I forgiven?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; I tried very hard not to smile, but I couldn&rsquo;t&#160;help it. He looked so appealingly confused, like a small boy; still,&#160;when he gazed at me with that sparkle in his eye, I knew I was his&#160;equal in every way, and that he admired me for it.&#160;<br><br>The music came to an end with a violin flourish; the dancers&#160;applauded, and Leo bowed while I curtsied. Somehow we had&#160;ended up in the center of the ballroom, all eyes upon us, and I decided&#160;that, after all, I did not want to be one among many. I&#160;wanted to be the sole prize upon the arm of Prince Leopold, admired,&#160;studied, envied. Holding my chin high and proud, feeling&#160;my cheeks blaze, knowing my eyes sparkled, I rejoiced that I was&#160;the talk of the ball. I had known notoriety, of course, but this was&#160;different; this was intoxicating, and I&rsquo;m afraid I rather encouraged&#160;it by laughing just a little louder than usual, touching Leo&rsquo;s&#160;arm, as he led me off the dance floor, just a little more often than&#160;necessary. Tonight, I did not care who saw me.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alice, my dear Alice! Let me look at you!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Suppressing a small sigh, I turned around to face my elder&#160;sister, just arrived from Scotland. She was attired in a silver blue&#160;taffeta gown, with rows of tiny pink silk rosebuds sewn vertically&#160;up the front of the bodice in an artistic attempt to draw the eye&#160;upward, not out, although there was no way to obscure the obvious;&#160;Ina had grown stout. There was no other word for it; my sister&#160;had grown stout and matronly after the arrival of her first&#160;child.&#160;<br><br>Her husband, William Skene, was a tall, thin man, kindly,&#160;with an air of endless patience. I was fond of my scholarly&#160;brother-in-law. He was a man very much like Papa&mdash;living in&#160;his head most of the time, although he had a certain hard practicality&#160;about him, too. My sister was a woman quite like my&#160;mother. They were a perfect match; dreamlike men always benefitted&#160;from energetic women.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;You look wonderful, darling.&rdquo; I embraced my sister. &ldquo;What&#160;a lovely frock! Wherever did you find that silvery shade of gray?&#160;It almost matches your eyes!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;London, of course; we can find nothing up in Edinburgh. I&#160;told William I simply <i>had </i>to dart down to London before the&#160;ball.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you did,&rdquo; I said with a quick smile, remembering&#160;many, many times when Ina had bossed me about in the same&#160;way. &ldquo;It was worth it; the dress is beautiful.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Mrs. Skene, it&rsquo;s a pleasure.&rdquo; Leo bowed to her, taking Ina&rsquo;s&#160;plump hand, lifting it to his lips. She blushed, curtsied, and began&#160;to fan herself furiously, one of her teasing smiles upon her lips,&#160;although the effect wasn&rsquo;t quite the same as it had been when she&#160;was fourteen.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness, how lovely it is to see you again. I&rsquo;m&#160;very happy to observe that you&rsquo;ve recovered fully from your illness.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Thank you. Of course, I had a great incentive to do so.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Smiling, Leo took possession of my left hand, tucking it under&#160;his arm. Ina&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up, her mouth pursed, and I saw her<i>&#160;</i>exchange a look with Mamma, who was standing in the doorway&#160;to the small anteroom that had been furnished for the Prince &rsquo;s&#160;private party.&#160;<br><br>Catching Ina&rsquo;s look, Mamma came rushing forward, practically&#160;dragging Rhoda by the arm. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Mamma said with a&#160;worried smile. &ldquo;I do hope you won&rsquo;t mind dancing with dear&#160;Rhoda&mdash;she has an unexpected opening on her dance card, and&#160;she was so hoping for a polka.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m rather booked,&rdquo; Leo said, glancing at my&#160;dance card, dangling from my wrist.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;But surely Alice won&rsquo;t mind sitting this out, in order to give&#160;her sister the pleasure of just one dance?&rdquo; Mamma continued to&#160;smile, more ferociously than before; she looked at me, her eyebrows&#160;nearly to her hairline. I felt the blood simmer in my veins,&#160;but I would not give way to my anger at her meddling.&#160;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I said, through gritted teeth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind in&#160;the least. Do go on.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Poor Rhoda&mdash;who obviously was not pleased to be used in&#160;such a way, as she had remained scowling at the floor through the&#160;entire exchange&mdash;curtsied as Leo bowed, then they repaired to&#160;the dance floor just as the orchestra started back up.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;That was very subtle, Mamma,&rdquo; I said, turning to meet her&#160;disapproving gaze. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next? Are you going to throw Ina at&#160;him, to keep us apart?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alice, of course I can&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; Ina huffed&mdash;even as she&#160;looked longingly at the dancers swirling about to the music. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&#160;married now.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I was being sarcastic, Ina.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alice, I&rsquo;m merely acting in the Prince&rsquo;s best interest,&rdquo;&#160;Mamma replied smoothly. &ldquo;It is unchivalrous of him to dance so&#160;often with just one partner. We wouldn&rsquo;t want word of his poor&#160;manners to get back to the Queen.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Even if Leo danced by himself in the middle of the floor, no&#160;one could accuse him of poor manners. The truth is, I don&rsquo;t believe&#160;you would mind at all if that sole partner wasn&rsquo;t me.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Mamma did not answer; she simply made a grand, sweeping&#160;turn and rejoined Papa and all their friends greedily partaking of&#160;Leo&rsquo;s hospitality, as his private room was furnished with superior&#160;refreshments.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t vex Mamma so, Alice,&rdquo; Ina murmured, patting the&#160;perfectly round sausagelike curls tickling the back of her neck&mdash;&#160;their chestnut brown not <i>quite </i>matching the rest of her hair, although&#160;I refrained from pointing this out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully&#160;impertinent these days.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I? Impertinent?&rdquo; I looked at my sister, my deceptively&#160;placid paragon of a sister. Her gray eyes returned my gaze unblinkingly.&#160;&ldquo;I daresay the Prince &rsquo;s attentions have gone to your head,&#160;Alice.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I wonder that there is only one person in this family who&#160;wants to see me happy. Dear Edith, I do wish she were here&#160;tonight!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said an unwelcome voice at my elbow; suddenly&#160;the cloying scent of cheap perfume filled my nostrils. Turning&#160;reluctantly&mdash;my limbs suddenly blanketed with dread&mdash;I came&#160;face-to-face with Mr. Ruskin.&#160;<br><br>I had not seen him since that nightmarish last afternoon. Observing&#160;the way his eyes glittered dangerously beneath his white,&#160;thundering brows, I knew he was remembering that day, too.&#160;While, to my great relief, he looked as usual&mdash;his clothes were&#160;neat, his abundant whiskers freshly groomed&mdash;I still feared for&#160;his reason. What name would he call me tonight? I had never<i>&#160;</i>known him to attend a ball before, as he declared them a ridiculous&#160;waste of money and time; what had brought him to this one?&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Mr. Ruskin.&rdquo; Ina curtsied.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;My dear Ina. Now, if only Edith were here, I could behold&#160;the lovely Liddell girls all over again. Ina, Alice, Edith&mdash;such&#160;pearls you are, still.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Ina&mdash;hardly a pearl; more like an oyster&mdash;simpered and&#160;blushed. I could not find it within me to flirt and carry on, as I&#160;once would have done; I had too much to fear of him. Too much&#160;to lose.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alice, my dear, you are simply a vision.&rdquo; He glanced at me,&#160;up and down&mdash;and I felt naked, vulnerable beneath his cold,&#160;boldly needful gaze.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Despite the heat of the room, I shivered.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;You and the Prince make such a lovely pair.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;We do?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you&rsquo;re like a flower on his arm. A lovely flower.&rdquo;&#160;I could not reply; my heart was beating too rapidly against&#160;my tight stays.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;A rose, I would say.&rdquo; He leaned toward me, so that his&#160;breath was tickling my neck. &ldquo;You look like a beautiful&mdash;<i>rose</i>.&rdquo;&#160;He whispered this last; placing his hand upon my arm, he stroked&#160;it, up and down, lightly, as if I were a blossom, opening to his&#160;touch.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&mdash;that is, I must&mdash;Prince Leopold!&rdquo; For he was suddenly&#160;beside me, having led a flushed Rhoda off the dance floor; I&#160;hadn&rsquo;t even noticed the music had stopped.&#160;<br><br>Laughing, gasping, I reached for his gloved hand; he took&#160;mine, pulling me to him, and I felt safe once more.<br><br>&ldquo;Mr. Ruskin!&rdquo; Leo shook his hand with apparent delight, surprising&#160;familiarity.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Sir.&rdquo; Ruskin bowed.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I must tell you, once again, how grateful I am for your&mdash;&#160;assistance in that matter.&rdquo; Leo&rsquo;s smile was wide and genuine; his&#160;eyes danced with the delight of a happy secret as he looked at me,&#160;then back at Mr. Ruskin.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;It is my pleasure. I am only too happy to provide what little&#160;help I can. I only wish it is of value to you, after all.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I have great hopes that it will be. Great hopes.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;What secrets are you two keeping from me?&rdquo; I tried to make&#160;my voice light, my face untroubled, but I could not ignore the&#160;heavy stone of dread settling in the pit of my stomach. I did not&#160;enjoy knowing that both Leo and I were engaged in some sort of&#160;secret dealings with John Ruskin, of all people.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Ah, but that is not for you to know just yet!&rdquo; Leo reached&#160;down and studied the dance card dangling, by a slim gold thread,&#160;from my wrist. &ldquo;Hmmm. I wonder, who is this &lsquo;Prince Leopold&rsquo;&#160;fellow?&rdquo; And before I could say anything more to Mr. Ruskin,&#160;Leo had swept me up and back out on the dance floor with so&#160;much speed&mdash;he was turning me about in such tight circles I was&#160;dizzy&mdash;I could scarcely catch my breath.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Leo! What on earth? The orchestra has barely started!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I could wait to have you in my arms no longer, I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo;&#160;His face was red, his eyes blazing with suppressed emotion; all I&#160;could do was follow him, allow him to propel me across the&#160;dance floor&mdash;bumping into other couples, stepping on trains,&#160;not even stopping to apologize&mdash;until somehow, we were all the&#160;way to the opposite side, and he was leading me through a small&#160;door.&#160;<br><br>He finally stopped then, and I could catch my breath for a<i>&#160;</i>moment and try to put myself back together; my dress was crumpled,&#160;and I knew the lace on my bustle must be in tatters. Finding&#160;ourselves suddenly alone, the music muffled on the other side of&#160;the door, Leo and I simply looked at each other and laughed. It&#160;was as if we shared a secret or had gotten away with some amazing&#160;deception, like two naughty children.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alone at last, my darling!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Leo, you take my breath away!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Without warning, he swooped down and kissed me on the&#160;lips, grabbed my hand, and started pulling me down a passage.&#160;I had held Leo&rsquo;s hand many times; I had felt his arm about&#160;me, looked into his eyes. But never before had I been so aware of&#160;his confidence, his sureness, his boldness. For I felt something&#160;different in the way he touched me, shepherding me down the&#160;hall past servants who flattened themselves against the walls&#160;as we hurried by; I felt the possession of a lover&mdash;perhaps a&#160;husband?&mdash;and my heart thrilled, every nerve strained and&#160;tensed, for I longed to submit, to be possessed.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Sir, I do not jest&mdash;you leave me, quite literally, breathless!&rdquo;&#160;I laughed, but I was serious, for he was walking so very fast I&#160;could hardly keep up, despite the firm grip he had on my hand.&#160;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my dear!&rdquo; He slowed, turning to smile at me&mdash;&#160;he was so eager, his smile seemed to take over his entire face.&#160; &ldquo;I quite forgot that ladies&rsquo; clothing is so devilishly&mdash;well, so&#160;devilishly <i>constraining</i>. Although I do think you look lovely&#160;tonight&mdash;have I told you?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Several times. But I&rsquo;ll never tire of hearing it.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Be careful what you wish for!&rdquo; With another smile&mdash;&#160;another twinkle of his blue eyes&mdash;he turned down a different&#160;passage; it was unlit, narrow, the floor uneven, and I could not&#160;see my hand before me. All I could do was trust in Leo to guide&#160;me, and I was glad to do so.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Watch your step!&rdquo; I heard the creak of a door, then stubbed&#160;my toe up against a small stair. Following him blindly, I stepped&#160;up, then out&mdash;into the night. Blinking at the relative brightness&mdash;&#160;the moon was not quite full, yet it shone purposefully down upon&#160;us&mdash;I found that we were in the large open-air market behind the&#160;Council Hall. It was empty tonight, of course, although the&#160;ground was still scattered with straw, and there were a few permanent&#160;wooden stalls as well as several benches. Leo led me to&#160;one, and laughed as I sank down upon it, finally able to catch my&#160;breath.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, truly, but I was so eager, you know, to have you&#160;entirely to myself!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Sir, I am most gratified, but do we dare it? We &rsquo;re quite unchaperoned!&rdquo;&#160;I smiled up at him; he was no longer laughing. The&#160;solemn look in his eyes chased away my own smile; I studied him&#160;with the same gravity, for I knew I would want to remember this&#160;moment for the rest of my life.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alice.&rdquo; He knelt beside me; I wondered, oddly, if he would&#160;dirty the knees of his trousers. &ldquo;Dearest Alice, please give me&#160;your hand.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>Trembling, I did as he asked.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Darling, I had the most amazing communication this&#160;evening from Mamma. She sends her best wishes, naturally.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;How very kind of her,&rdquo; I said automatically, wishing he&#160;would get to the point while also, strangely, happy to linger in the&#160;sweet anticipation of the moment; just to see the love light in his&#160;eyes, those hopeful, thoughtful eyes, filled all the aching, empty&#160;places of my heart up with a quiet joy.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, well&mdash;she knows, now, how very&mdash;fond&mdash;I am of&#160;you. I&rsquo;ve taken great care in telling her. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve been<i>&#160;</i>rather a boring correspondent, as I&rsquo;ve had just one single subject.&#160;You.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, is the Queen very tired of me?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I daresay&mdash;particularly as I even enlisted others in my&#160;cause.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;You have?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want to trust our happiness to my own feeble&#160;pen. That was what I was referring to, with Mr. Ruskin. I asked&#160;him, as well as Duckworth&mdash;your old friends, of course&mdash;to&#160;write to her, also. She respects them, and she knows their great&#160;regard for your father, their long association with your family. I&#160;felt that would be the wisest course, don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;&#160;Did a cloud veil the moon, or was it fear that darkened the&#160;night, chilling my bones? Yet I told myself that Leo would not be&#160;on his knees beside me if the Queen had not given him reason to&#160;hope. What could Mr. Duckworth say, after all? He was a good&#160;man. He was also Mr. Dodgson&rsquo;s closest friend.&#160;<br><br>But Mr. Dodgson was kind, I had seen it in his eyes; he&#160;wanted me to be happy&mdash;<i>may we be happy</i>&mdash;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, Leo!&rdquo; My heart fluttered, sickeningly, to my feet. And&#160;why hadn&rsquo;t Mr. Ruskin mentioned this to me before? If he intended&#160;to aid us, would he not have told me?&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;What is it, dear? You look so distressed&mdash;is it the cold?&#160;Here, do take my coat&mdash;I forgot about your wrap.&rdquo; With a&#160;sweet, worried shake of his head&mdash;entirely in the manner of one&#160;delighted to find himself suddenly responsible for another&mdash;he&#160;removed his jacket and placed it about my shoulders.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said, looking up at him; his hands lingered&#160;upon my shoulders as he bent down to kiss me, gently, almost&#160;reverently.&#160;<i><br><br></i>But then his lips&mdash;his soft, full lips&mdash;sought more; he sank&#160;down beside me on the bench, wrapped me in his arms, and took&#160;my love as insistently as I could give it. I sought, too&mdash;pulling&#160;away with a little gasp, my limbs limp, only his arms holding me&#160;up, I suddenly needed more; I met his lips, tasted his tongue, with&#160;a hunger of my own. My arm arched gracefully about his neck&mdash;&#160;a strange liquid thrill shot through my womb, and I cried out,&#160;even as I sought more.&#160;<br><br>And he was eager to provide it; he leaned into me, pressing&#160;down upon my body almost until I could no longer hold myself&#160;upright; I sank down, down, down until my back nearly touched&#160;the bench.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, darling!&rdquo; Suddenly he sprang back, wrenched&#160;away, and pushed at my shoulders, his hands trembling. Leo&#160;shook his head, as if to clear it; I searched his face, still wanting&#160;more; still wanting to possess him, possess him so absolutely that&#160;nothing he could hear&mdash;not from the Queen, nor Mr. Duckworth,&#160;nor Mr. Ruskin&mdash;could ever keep us apart.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, Leo?&rdquo; Struggling to sit upright, I felt my hair falling&#160;down the back of my neck, and I saw Edith&rsquo;s diamond clip&#160;sparkling on the ground near the bench. I studied him anxiously;&#160;wanting so very much to please him.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;that is, we mustn&rsquo;t do much more of&mdash;that, at&#160;least not now. Not until&mdash;not until later, my dear.&rdquo; He clenched&#160;his hands into fists, holding them tight for a long moment before&#160;finally relaxing them and turning back to smile at me. I noticed,&#160;however, that he was still breathing heavily.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh! Yes, of course, I quite understand.&rdquo; I did understand&#160;that it was different with men; their passions were more difficult&#160;to control.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Although I must say, dear Alice, you do kiss quite well.&#160;Almost as if you&rsquo;ve been kissed before, many times!&rdquo; Now he<i>&#160;</i>was teasing me, I knew; his eyes glittered and coaxed, until I was&#160;forced to smile, despite my sudden queasiness.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Well, I have been&mdash;you&rsquo;ve kissed me yourself!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m much more accomplished than I&rsquo;ve been led to believe.&rdquo;&#160;He&mdash;very gingerly, as if I might be too warm to touch&mdash;&#160;placed his hand upon mine and sat quietly for a moment, until his&#160;breathing came more regularly.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Now, then, you&rsquo;ve quite gotten me off track. I do believe I&#160;was speaking very seriously about a matter of great importance&#160;to us both.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes, of course&mdash;do go on.&rdquo; I tried to match the lightness of&#160;his tone, even as I fought off a rising bubble of panic. Had I been&#160;overeager? Had I scared him away? I had always been confident&#160;around Leo, knowing I was his equal in so many ways. Suddenly,&#160;I was very unsure of myself. I did not feel on equal footing, not&#160;at all; I was so close to my heart&rsquo;s desire that I was unable to&#160;think, to choose, to act, for fear of chasing it away.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;As I said&mdash;before I was so spectacularly interrupted&mdash;I&rsquo;ve&#160;written Mamma, and she understands where my heart lies. With&#160;you, of course, my Alice. And this afternoon, then, I received a&#160;letter from her, a most encouraging letter&mdash;&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Alice! Alice!&rdquo; It was a strange voice calling my name; startled,&#160;Leo and I both looked up. Someone was running toward us,&#160;across the great expanse of the marketplace.&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;What? Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; We rose, and I tried to make out the&#160;approaching figure, sprinting, as if to a fire, calling my name.&#160;&ldquo;Alice&mdash;there you are! We &rsquo;ve been looking everywhere!&#160;Come quickly&mdash;we must leave right away!&rdquo; It was William&#160;Skene, his shirt untucked, his coat half off his shoulders; he bent&#160;over, hands upon his knees, struggling to catch his breath before he looked at me&mdash;I saw, even in the moonlight, that his face was&#160;deathly pale.<br><br>&#160;&ldquo;What? What is it?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Edith. It&rsquo;s Edith&mdash;quick, we must go back to the Deanery.&#160;Your parents have already left with Ina and Rhoda&mdash;I&rsquo;m to take&#160;you in my carriage.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;Edith?&rdquo; I could only repeat her name, for it did not register&#160;in my brain. Edith? Edith was home, in bed; I had just waltzed&#160;around her room, getting ready for this night. &ldquo;What about&#160;Edith?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ill&mdash;very, very ill. Dr. Acland has gone, too. Come&mdash;&#160;we can&rsquo;t tarry. Prince Leopold, help me!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br>I did not understand what he meant, but somehow Leo was&#160;pushing me&mdash;gently, yet forcibly&mdash;toward William, who was&#160;hurrying back across the market square. Then I was in front of&#160;the Corn Exchange, being lifted into the carriage&mdash;I heard my&#160;brother-in-law yell to his driver to hurry, there was no time to&#160;waste&mdash;and somehow I found the presence of mind to lean out&#160;of the carriage window and look, one more time, at Leo as the&#160;horses pulled away. I realized, too late, that I was still wrapped in&#160;his jacket; it smelled like moonlight, like warm breezes, faded&#160;jasmine. My own scent, I realized; it had mixed and lingered with&#160;his. I smelled myself upon his coat.&#160; <br><br>Leo was standing at the curb, just under a streetlamp; the light&#160;shone down upon him, making his hair a golden halo but obscuring&#160;his face so I could not see his eyes. He raised his arm in&#160;farewell, opened his mouth as if to speak.&#160;<br><br>We rounded the street corner before I could hear what he&#160;said, but I was sure that it was just one word&mdash;&#160;Alice.&#160;&#160;
