That's why Lydia Goetz, owner of A Good Yarn on Seattle's Blossom Street, offers a class called Knit to Quit. It's for people who want to quit something&mdash;or someone!&mdash;and start a new phase of their lives.<P>First to join is Phoebe Rylander, who's trying to get over a man. Alix Turner and her husband want a baby, so she has to quit smoking. And Bryan Hutchinson needs a way to deal with the stress of running his family's business.<P>Then there's Lydia's friend Anne Marie Roche. She and her adopted daughter, Ellen, have finally settled into a secure and happy routine&mdash;when a stranger appears asking questions.<P>Meanwhile, Lydia and her husband, Brad, have their hands full with the angry, defiant twelve-year-old who unexpectedly becomes their foster child&hellip;.<P>But when your life&mdash;and your stitches&mdash;get snarled, your friends can <i>always</i> help!</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Macomber adds a tear-jerking installment to the Blossom Street series with this account of lives intersecting at the series-hinging yarn store, A Good Yarn. Upbeat cancer survivor Lydia and her pragmatic sister, Margaret, start a "Knit to Quit" group in their Blossom Street yarn store, hoping to bring in customers for weekly self-help sessions. Casey, the 12-year-old girl Lydia takes in while waiting for an infant of her own to adopt, helps out in the shop when she's not sulking in her room or causing trouble for Lydia's family. Local baker Alix wants a baby as much as Lydia does, but she and her husband agree she needs to quit smoking first. Then there's super-stressed chocolate magnate, Hutch, who takes the knitting class after his doctor suggests it. Hutch hits it off with Phoebe, who is trying to quit obsessing about a broken engagement. Rounding out the crowd, bookstore owner Ann Marie must deal with her adopted daughter Ellen's biological father, a recovering addict, re-entering their lives. Macomber deftly handles the multiple story lines and emotional terrain of families, while the predictably happy ending is very genuine. <I>(May)</I></P>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

											I love Debbie's &quot;Blossom Street&quot; series...I find myself falling in love with all her Seattle characters, their shops, and their stories.  Because I'm a CPS social worker in real life, I loved Casey's story, and could really feel for the social worker, desperately calling for a &quot;temporary&quot; home (we all hope those temporary placements work out for the long term!).  I also liked the sticky tape analogy presented to describe attachment disorder, a common feature of foster youth.  I've even used it at work several times to explain why foster youth tend to act out.  Thank you, Debbie, for showing your readers how family is who you decide it will be!</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/40470000/40476583.JPG" alt="" height="154" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Debbie Macomber</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Port Orchard, Washington</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>October 22, 1948</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Yakima, Washington</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Graduated from high school in 1966; attended community college</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.debbiemacomber.com">* Debbie Macomber's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Publishing did not come easy to self-described "creative speller" Debbie Macomber. When Macomber decided to follow her dreams of becoming a bestselling novelist, she had a lot of obstacles in her path. For starters, Macomber is dyslexic. On top of this, she had only a high school degree, four young children at home, and absolutely no connections in the publishing world. If there's one thing you can say about Debbie Macomber, however, it is that she does not give up. She rented a typewriter and started writing, determined to break into the world of romance fiction.   <P>The years went on and the rejection letters piled up. Her family was living on a shoestring budget, and Debbie was beginning to think that her dreams of being a novelist might never be fulfilled. She began writing for magazines to earn some extra money, and she eventually saved up enough to attend a romance writer's conference with three hundred other aspiring novelists. The organizers of the conference picked ten manuscripts to review in a group critique session. Debbie was thrilled to learn that her manuscript would be one of the novels discussed.   <P>Her excitement quickly faded when an editor from Harlequin tore her manuscript to pieces in front of the crowded room, evoking peals of laughter from the assembled writers. Afterwards, Macomber approached the editor and asked her what she could do to improve her novel. "Throw it away," the editor suggested.   <P>Many writers would have given up right then and there, but not Macomber. The deeply religious Macomber took a lesson from Job and gathered strength from adversity. She returned home and mailed one last manuscript to Silhouette, a publisher of romance novels. "It cost $10 to mail it off," Macomber told the <I>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</I> in 2000. "My husband was out of work at this time, in Alaska, trying to find a job. The children and I were living on his $250-a-week unemployment, and I can't tell you what $10 was to us at that time."   <P>It turned out to be the best $10 Macomber ever spent. In 1984, Silhouette published her novel, <I>Heartsong</I>. (Incidentally, although <I>Heartsong</I>  was Macomber's first sale, she actually published another book, <I>Starlight</I>, before <I>Heartsong</I> went to print.) <I>Heartsong</I> went on to become the first romance novel to ever be reviewed in <I>Publishers Weekly</I>, and Macomber was finally on her way.  <P>Today, Macomber is one of the most widely read authors in America. A regular on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller charts,  she is best known for her Cedar Cove novels, a heartwarming story sequence set in a small town in Washington state, and for her Knitting Books series, featuring a group of women who patronize a Seattle yarn store. In addition, her backlist of early romances, including several contemporary Westerns, has been reissued with great success.  <P>Macomber has made a successful transition from conventional romance to the somewhat more flexible genre known as "women's fiction." "I was at a point in my life where I found it difficult to identify with a 25-year-old heroine," Macomber said in an interview with ContemporaryRomanceWriters.com. "I found that I wanted to write more about the friendships women share with each other." To judge from her avid, ever-increasing fan base, Debbie's readers heartily approve.</P></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some outtakes from our interview with Macomber:</I> <p>  <b>"I'm dyslexic, although they didn't have a word for it</b> when I was in grade school. The teachers said I had 'word blindness.' I've always been a creative speller and never achieved good grades in school. I graduated from high school but didn't have the opportunity to attend college, so I did what young women my age did at the time -- I married. I was a teenager, and Wayne and I (now married nearly 37 years) had four children in five years."<p>    <b>"I'm a yarnaholic. That means I have more yarn stashed away</b> than any one person could possibly use in three or four lifetimes. There's something inspiring about yarn that makes me feel I could never have enough. Often I'll go into my yarn room (yes, room!) and just hold skeins of yarn and dream about projects. It's a comforting thing to do."<p>    <b>"My office walls are covered with autographs of famous writers</b> -- it's what my children call my �dead author wall.' I have signatures from Mark Twain, Earnest Hemingway, Jack London, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Pearl Buck, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, to name a few."  <p>     <b>"I'm morning person, and rip into the day with a half-mile swim</b> (FYI: a half mile is a whole lot farther in the water than it is on land) at the local pool before I head into the office, arriving before eight. It takes me until nine or ten to read through all of the guest book entries from my web site and the mail before I go upstairs to the turret where I do my writing. Yes, I write in a turret -- is that romantic, or what? I started blogging last September and really enjoy sharing bits and pieces of my life with my readers. Once I'm home for the day, I cook dinner, trying out new recipes. Along with cooking, I also enjoy eating, especially when the meal is accompanied by a glass of good wine. Wayne and I take particular pleasure in sampling eastern Washington State wines (since we were both born and raised in that part of the state). <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the spring of 2005, Debbie Macomber took some time out to answer our questions.</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  The one book that has had the strongest influence on my life, without question, is the Bible. God's Word has been the guiding force behind all I do. I read the Bible each and every day and gain inspiration, encouragement, and joy.  <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  Before I answer this, I feel it's necessary to mention that I read widely, across the board.  In compiling this list I discovered several of my favorite books are nonfiction. I have not noted the Bible a second time, although as I indicated above, it is the most influential book in my life. <p>    <li><I>Charms for the Easy Life</I> by Kaye Gibbons -- For its charm, its wonderful writing, and its truth. (I introduced this book to my editor, who now loves Kaye Gibbons's work as much as I do.) <p>    <li><I>And Then There Was Light</I> by Jacques Lusseyran -- I read this book shortly after learning that my father had been a POW in WWII, something he never talked about until the end of his life. It helped me understand some of what he endured and gave me a deep appreciation of the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation. <p>    <li><I>The Power of Positive Thinking</I> by Norman Vincent Peale -- When I first decided to write, I knew I was going to need all the positive reinforcement I could get. I read and reread Dr. Peale's wonderful words of wisdom. After I published my first book, I wrote Dr. Peale to thank him for his inspiration, and he wrote me back. It is a letter I will always treasure. <p>    <li><I>The Wolf and the Dove</I> by Kathleen E.  Woodiwiss -- I loved and read this historical romance so often that I had the first page nearly memorized. Kathleen Woodiwiss opened my eyes to the possibilities of fiction. These characters felt real to me. I cheered and cried with them and never wanted the book to end. I first read this book in the early 1980s and knew from that moment on that I wanted my readers to feel the same way when they finished one of my books.   <p>    <li><I>Why Good Girls Don't Get Ahead but Gutsy Girls Do</I> by Kate White -- This business-related book taught me that I'm a gutsy girl in a good-girl disguise. It offers some of the soundest career advice I've read. <p>    <li><I>The 21 Immutable Laws of Marketing</I> by Al Ries and Jack Trout -- Another wonderful business book that is  full of interesting tidbits about the buying public, their buying habits and how best to market to them. <p>    <li><I>The Notorious Rake</I> by Mary Balogh -- I'm a real fan of Regency romances, and I consider this one of the best.  I read this book in one sitting, unable to put it down. <p>    <li><I>The 13th Juror</I> by John Lescroart -- This is one of the best-plotted and most interesting books I've read in ages, and I have recommended it again and again. John is a wonderful writer, and we discovered that we have a great deal in common, including the fact that both our fathers were POWs in WWII. <p>    <li><I>If Ever I Return, Pretty Peggy-O</I> by Sharyn McCrumb -- My editor recommended this author to me and commented that she envied me the experience of reading my first Sharyn McCrumb. (This book is the first of her Ballad series, all set in Appalachia.) Later I was fortunate enough to meet Sharyn at a writers' conference, so I could tell her how much I enjoyed her work. <p>    <li><I>Walking After Midnight</I> by Karen Robards -- This book was pure fun. I felt as though I was on a roller-coaster ride, and every page was a thrill.  <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  I'm a big film buff, although I'm not fond of movies with excessive violence. I've always enjoyed musicals. My first exposure was with <I>West Side Story</I>. I memorized all the songs and belted them out for months afterward. I almost entered the convent after watching <I>The Sound of Music</I>. Thankfully, I didn't; it wouldn't have been a good fit for either of us. In recent years I've enjoyed <I>The Princess Bride</I> and the <I>Star Wars</I> series. I like movies with what I call a zinger -- <I>Collateral</I> and <i>The Replacement Killers</I> are good examples. And comedies, too.  I don't think I've ever laughed so hard as when I watched <I>The Gods Must Be Crazy</I>, <I>It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World</I>, and <I>The Hallelujah Trail</I>. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I don't listen to music while writing. It's not that I need silence in order to create. I started out writing when our four children were small and I needed to keep my ears tuned to them in case one of them decided to play Superman and fly out a window or start a campfire in the middle of the living room. When it comes to listening to the radio, I prefer the oldies stations. When I'm on the treadmill, I play Christian CDs and make a joyful noise. Correction: It's a joyful noise to me, but I doubt others would think so.  <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  There's a bookstore directly below my office. It's hard to believe but I write above a bookstore <I>and</I> an ice cream parlor. This, my friends, is a writer's nirvana. On average I buy a book a day, and that's no exaggeration. Mostly I purchase nonfiction for gifts. One of my favorites is <I>Gifts from the Sea</I> by Anne Morrow Lindberg. For my writer friends I've bought <I>Goals</I> by Brian Tracy, and for friends who are animal lovers I've bought <I>The Dog Who Rescues Cats</I> by Gonzalez & Fleischer. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have a cherrywood desk with a glass top to protect the wood. Over the years a number of things have made their way under the glass. There's a picture of my dad and his brother, who looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for identical twins -- only my dad was a full foot shorter than his brother. Then there are pictures of my grandchildren (by far the cutest grandkids in the universe), and there's a slip of paper on which I've written four words. They are:  "provocative," "relevant," "creative," and "honest." When I decide on a plot for one of my big hardcover stories, I weigh the story against each of these words. I want to provoke my readers to think. I want the story to be relevant to them and to our times. My goal is to tell this story in as creative a way as possible and to be honest with my readers and with myself. As you might have guessed, I'm a lover of words. As for rituals, I really don't have any.  <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  In my humble opinion, there are a lot of writers out there who haven't suffered enough. I suffered plenty. When I first started writing, I didn't know another writer in the world. This was back in the late 1970s before Romance Writers of America was formed. For nearly five years I wrote and submitted my manuscripts. My work was rejected so fast it practically hit me in the back of the head on my way home from the post office. At one point in my lonely sojourn, an editor read and reviewed my manuscript, and with the utmost sincerity told me there was no use in revising it and the best thing I could do was <I>throw it away</I>. Thankfully, I didn't take her advice, because that <I>same</I> manuscript sold to a rival publishing house and launched my writing career. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I would suggest that writers pay close attention to the market -- read the bestsellers, analyze each story and look for the key element that is drawing an audience. Who would ever have imagined that <I>Life of Pi</I> by Yann Martel would command the audience it has? Or <I>The Da Vinci Code</I>? As writers, it's important we not <I>follow</I> trends but observe and understand life -- and start our own. It was when I saw a lot of angel figurines turning up in catalogs that I wrote the first Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy Christmas book.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P><b>Knitting and life.</b><P>They're both about beginnings&mdash;and endings.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>The fifth entry (after <i>The Shop on Blossom Street</i>, <i>A Good Yarn</i>, <i>Back on Blossom Street</i>, and <i>Twenty Wishes</i>) in Macomber's "Blossom Street" series follows her successful format of introducing new as well as familiar characters through their joint association at Lydia Goetz's Seattle knit shop. This time, Lydia is offering a "Knit to Quit" class, which attracts a woman trying to forget her unfaithful boyfriend, a man ordered by his doctor to reduce stress, and another young woman trying to give up smoking. Under the gentle guidance of Lydia and her cantankerous sister, Margaret, the class succeeds in coping with their issues in a variety of ways. Macomber manages to remain optimistic if not a tad unrealistic in resolving all of the dilemmas presented and ensuring a happy and satisfying conclusion. Knitting definitely plays a role here, but it shouldn't deter readers who don't have a passion for the needle arts from enjoying this title. Macomber shows no signs of fatigue in keeping her fictional Blossom Street books unique and entertaining.

Standing in the doorway I breathed in the sweet scent of day lilies, gladiolas, roses and lavender from Susannah's Garden, the flower shop next door.<P>It was the beginning of summer, and although the sky was overcast and rain threatened to fall at any moment, the sun shone brightly in my heart. (My husband, Brad, always laughs when I say things like that. But I don't care. As a woman who's survived cancer not once but twice, I feel entitled to the occasional sentimental remark. Especially today&hellip;)<P>I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, enjoying the early-morning peace. I just don't think there's anyplace more beautiful than Seattle in the summer. All the flowers spilling out of Susannah's Garden are one of the benefits. The array of colors, as well as the heady perfume drifting in my direction, makes me so glad A Good Yarn is located where it is.<P>Whiskers, my shop cat, as Brad calls him, ambled across the hardwood floor and leaped into the window display, nestling among the skeins of pastel yarns. He takes up residence there most days and has long been a neighborhood favorite. The apartment upstairs is an extra storeroom for yarn at the moment; perhaps one day I'll rent it out again but that isn't in the plans yet.<P>The French Caf&#233; across the street was already busy, as it is every morning. The windows were filled with pastries, breads and croissants warm from the oven, and their delectable aroma added to the scents I associate with summer on Blossom Street. Alix Turner is usually there by five to bake many of these wonderful temptations. She's one of my dearest friends&mdash;and was among my first customers. I'm so proud of everything she's accomplished in the past few years. It's fair to say she reinvented her life&mdash;with a little help from her friends. She has an education and a career now, and she's married to a man who seems completely right for her.<P>Blossom Street Books down the street was ready for business, too. Anne Marie Roche and her staff often leave the front door open as a welcoming gesture, inviting those who wander past to come inside and browse. She and her daughter, Ellen, would be coming home from Paris later today.<P>Nearly every afternoon Ellen walks their Yorkie past the window so Whiskers and Baxter can stare fiercely at each other. Ellen insists it's all for show, that the cat and dog are actually good friends but don't want any of us to know that.<P>I grinned at Whiskers because I couldn't resist sharing my joy and excitement&mdash;even with the cat. In fact, I wanted to tell the whole world my news. Yesterday, we found out that we'd been approved for adoption. I hadn't yet shared this information with anyone, including my sister, Margaret. We've been through the interviews, the home test and fingerprinting. And last night we heard.<P>We're going to adopt a baby.<P>Because of my cancer, pregnancy is out of the question. While the ability to conceive has been taken from me, the desire for a baby hasn't. It's like an ache that never quite goes away. As much as possible I've tried to hide this from Brad. Whenever thoughts of what cancer has stolen from me enter my head, I try hard to counter them by remembering all the blessings I've received in my life. I want to celebrate every day, savor every minute, without resentment or regret.<P>I have so much for which to be grateful. I'm alive and cancer-free. I'm married to a man I adore. His son, Cody, now nine years old, has become my son, too. And I have a successful business, one that brings me great pleasure and satisfaction. When I first opened A Good Yarn, it was my way of shouting to the world that I refused to let cancer rob me of anything else. I was going to <i>live </i>and I was going to do it without the constant threat of illness and death. I was determined to bask in the sunshine. I still am.<P>So A Good Yarn was the start of my new life. Within a year of opening the store, I met Brad Goetz and we were married the following spring. Because of what I'd been through in my teens and again in my twenties, I didn't have a lot of experience with men or relationships. At first, Brad's love terrified me. Then I learned not to reject something good just because I was afraid of its loss. I learned that I could trust this man&mdash;and myself.<P>How blessed I am to be loved by him and Cody. Each and every day I thank God for the two men in my life.<P>Even with all I have, my arms ached to hold a baby. <i>Our baby. </i>Brad, who knows me so well, understood my need. After discussing the subject for weeks on end, after vacillating, weighing the pros and cons, we'd reached our decision.<P>Yes, we were going to adopt.<P>The catalyst for all this happened when Anne Marie Roche adopted eight-year-old Ellen.<P>I realized the wait for a newborn might be lengthy but we were both prepared for that. Although we'd be thrilled with an infant of either sex, I secretly longed for a little girl.<P>I heard the back door close and turned to see my sister, Margaret. She's worked with me almost from the first day I opened the shop. Although we're as different as any two sisters could be, we've become close.<P>Margaret is a good balance for me, ever practical and pragmatic, and I think I balance her, too, since I'm much more optimistic and given to occasional whimsy.<P>&#34;Good morning!&#34; I greeted her cheerfully, unable to disguise my happiness.<P>&#34;It's going to pour,&#34; she muttered, taking off her raincoat and hanging it in the back storeroom.<P>My sister tends to see the negative. The glass would always be half-empty to Margaret. Or completely empty&mdash;if not shattered on the floor. Over the years I've grown accustomed to her attitude and simply ignore it.<P>When she'd finished removing her coat, Margaret stared at me, then frowned. &#34;Why are <i>you </i>so happy?&#34; she demanded. &#34;Anybody can see we're about to have a downpour.&#34;<P>&#34;Me? Happy?&#34; There wasn't much point in trying to hold back my news, even though I knew Margaret was the one person who wouldn't understand my pleasure. She'd disapprove and would have no qualms about imparting her opinion. It's her pessimistic nature, I suppose, and the fact that she worries about me, although she'd never admit that.<P>Margaret continued to glare. &#34;You're grinning from ear to ear.&#34;<P>I made busy work at the cash register in order to avoid eye contact. I might as well tell her, although I dreaded her response. &#34;Brad and I have applied for adoption,&#34; I blurted out, unable to stop myself. &#34;And our application's been accepted.&#34;<P>A startled silence followed.<P>&#34;I know you think we're making a mistake,&#34; I rushed to add.<P>&#34;I didn't say that.&#34; Margaret walked slowly toward me.<P>&#34;You didn't need to <i>say </i>anything,&#34; I told her. Just once I wanted Margaret to be happy for me, without doubts and objections and concerns. &#34;Your silence said it all.&#34;<P>Margaret joined me at the counter next to the cash register. She seemed to sense that her reaction had hurt me. &#34;I'm only wondering if adoption's a wise choice for you.&#34;<P>&#34;Margaret,&#34; I began, sighing as I spoke. &#34;Brad and I know what we're doing.&#34; Although Margaret hadn't said it openly, I could guess what concerned her most. She was afraid the cancer would return. I'm well aware of the possibility and have been ever since its recurrence ten years ago. It was a serious consideration and one that neither Brad nor I took lightly.<P>&#34;Brad agrees?&#34; My sister sounded skeptical.<P>&#34;Of course he agrees! I'd never go against his wishes.&#34;<P>Margaret still didn't look convinced. &#34;You're <i>sure </i>this is what you want?&#34;<P>&#34;Yes.&#34; I was adamant. Sometimes that's the only way to reach her. &#34;Brad knows the risks as well as I do. You don't need to spell it out, Margaret. I understand why you're afraid for me, but I'm through with living in fear.&#34;<P>Margaret's eyes revealed her apprehensions. She studied me and after a moment asked, &#34;What if the adoption agency doesn't find you a child?&#34;<P>This was something Brad and I had discussed and it could certainly happen. I shrugged. &#34;Nothing ventured, nothing gained. We'll take the chance.&#34;<P>&#34;You want an infant?&#34;<P>&#34;Yes.&#34; I pictured a newborn, wrapped in a soft pink blanket, gently placed in my waiting arms. I held on to the image, allowing it to bring me comfort, to fill me with hope.<P>To my surprise Margaret didn't immediately voice another objection. After a thoughtful minute or two, she said in low tones, &#34;You'd be a good mother&hellip;you already are.&#34;<P>I'm sure my jaw fell open. The shock of Margaret's endorsement was almost more than I could take in. This was as close as Margaret had ever come to bestowing her approval on anything regarding my personal life. No, that wasn't fair. She'd been partially responsible for Brad and me getting back together when I'd pushed him away&mdash;a reconciliation that led directly to our marriage.<P>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I whispered and touched her arm.<P>Margaret made some gruff, unintelligible reply and moved to the table at the back of the store. She pulled out a chair, sat down and took out her crocheting.<P>&#34;I put up the poster you made for our new class,&#34; I told her, doing my best to conceal the emotion that crept into my voice. The last thing I'd expected from Margaret had been her blessing, and I was deeply touched by her words.<P>She acknowledged my comment with a nod.<P>The idea for our new knitting class had been Margaret's. &#34;Knit to Quit,&#34; she called it, and I loved her suggestion. Since opening the yarn store five years earlier, I'd noticed how many different reasons my customers&mdash;mostly women but also a few men&mdash;had for learning to knit.<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><html><body> <b><br> Summer On Blossom Street <br></b> <hr noshade size="1"><br><b> By Debbie Macomber </b><br></hr> <b><b> Mira </b></b> <br><b> Copyright &copy; 2009 </b><br> <br><b> Debbie Macomber <br>All right reserved.</b><br><br> <br><b> ISBN&#58; 9780778326434 </b><br><br> <hr noshade size='1'></hr>    In knitting, as in life, we grow when we challenge ourselves.

I was going to <I>live </i>and I was going to do it without the constant threat of illness and death. I was determined to bask in the sunshine. I still am.<P>So A Good Yarn was the start of my new life. Within a year of opening the store, I met Brad Goetz and we were married the following spring. Because of what I'd been through in my teens and again in my twenties, I didn't have a lot of experience with men or relationships. At first, Brad's love terrified me. Then I learned not to reject something good just because I was afraid of its loss. I learned that I could trust this man&#151;and myself.<P>How blessed I am to be loved by him and Cody. Each and every day I thank God for the two men in my life.<P>Even with all I have, my arms ached to hold a baby. <I>Our </i>baby. Brad, who knows me so well, understood my need. After discussing the subject for weeks on end, after vacillating, weighing the pros and cons, we'd reached our decision.<P>Yes, we were going to adopt.<P>The catalyst for all this happened when Anne Marie Roche adopted eight-year-old Ellen.<P>I realized the wait for a newborn might be lengthy but we were both prepared for that. Although we'd be thrilled with an infant of either sex, I secretly longed for a little girl.<P>I heard the back door close and turned to see my sister, Margaret. She's worked with me almost from the first day I opened the shop. Although we're as different as any two sisters could be, we've become close. Margaret is a good balance for me, ever practical and pragmatic, and I think I balance her, too, since I'm much more optimistic and given to occasional whimsy.<P>"Good morning!" I greeted her cheerfully, unable to disguise my happiness.<P>"It's going to pour," she muttered, taking off her raincoat and hanging it in the back storeroom.<P>My sister tends to see the negative. The glass would always be half-empty to Margaret. Or completely empty&#151;if not shattered on the floor. Over the years I've grown accustomed to her attitude and simply ignore it.<P>When she'd finished removing her coat, Margaret stared at me, then frowned. "Why are <I>you </i>so happy?" she demanded. "Anybody can see we're about to have a downpour."<P>"Me? Happy?" There wasn't much point in trying to hold back my news, even though I knew Margaret was the one person who wouldn't understand my pleasure. She'd disapprove and would have no qualms about imparting her opinion. It's her pessimistic nature, I suppose, and the fact that she worries about me, although she'd never admit that.<P>Margaret continued to glare. "You're grinning from ear to ear."<P>I made busy work at the cash register in order to avoid eye contact. I might as well tell her, although I dreaded her response. "Brad and I have applied for adoption," I blurted out, unable to stop myself. "And our application's been accepted."<P>A startled silence followed.<P>"I know you think we're making a mistake," I rushed to add.<P>"I didn't say that." Margaret walked slowly toward me.<P>"You didn't need to <I>say </i>anything," I told her. Just once I wanted Margaret to be happy for me, without doubts and objections and concerns. "Your silence said it all."<P>Margaret joined me at the counter next to the cash register. She seemed to sense that her reaction had hurt me. "I'm only wondering if adoption's a wise choice for you."<P>"Margaret," I began, sighing as I spoke. "Brad and I know what we're doing." Although Margaret hadn't said it openly, I could guess what concerned her most. She was afraid the cancer would return. I'm well aware of the possibility and have been ever since its recurrence ten years ago. It was a serious consideration and one that neither Brad nor I took lightly.<P>"Brad agrees?" My sister sounded skeptical.<P>"Of course he agrees! I'd never go against his wishes."<P>Margaret still didn't look convinced. "You're <I>sure </i>this is what you want?"<P>"Yes." I was adamant. Sometimes that's the only way to reach her. "Brad knows the risks as well as I do. You don't need to spell it out, Margaret. I understand why you're afraid for me, but I'm through with living in fear."<P>Margaret's eyes revealed her apprehensions. She studied me and after a moment asked, "What if the adoption agency doesn't find you a child?"<P>This was something Brad and I had discussed and it could certainly happen. I shrugged. "Nothing ventured, nothing gained. We'll take the chance."<P>"You want an infant?"<P>"Yes." I pictured a newborn, wrapped in a soft pink blanket, gently placed in my waiting arms. I held on to the image, allowing it to bring me comfort, to fill me with hope.<P>To my surprise Margaret didn't immediately voice another objection. After a thoughtful minute or two, she said in low tones, "You'd be a good mother&#133; you already are."<P>I'm sure my jaw fell open. The shock of Margaret's endorsement was almost more than I could take in. This was as close as Margaret had ever come to bestowing her approval on anything regarding my personal life. No, that wasn't fair. She'd been partially responsible for Brad and me getting back together when I'd pushed him away&#151;a reconciliation that led directly to our marriage.<P>"Thank you," I whispered and touched her arm.<P>Margaret made some gruff, unintelligible reply and moved to the table at the back of the store. She pulled out a chair, sat down and took out her crocheting.<P>"I put up the poster you made for our new class," I told her, doing my best to conceal the emotion that crept into my voice. The last thing I'd expected from Margaret had been her blessing, and I was deeply touched by her words.<P>She acknowledged my comment with a nod. <BR><BR><i>Continues...</i>  <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><br> Excerpted from <b>Summer On Blossom Street</b>  by <b>Debbie Macomber</b>  Copyright &copy; 2009   by Debbie Macomber.
