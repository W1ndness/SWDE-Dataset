											The last time I visited the world of the Satyrs in Italy, I thought it would be exactly that: the last time. Imagine my delight to learn that Elizabeth Amber had started another set of Satyr books set several years after the first books, but in a different part of Italy. Again, I was pulled into one of Ms. Amber's books until the last page was turned and I kept tapping the next button on my e-reader hoping for just a few more words and a few more hints as to what would happen next.<p/><p/>Dane Satyr and Eva Delacorte were absolutely wonderful to get to know. Ms. Amber has a way of painting a picture of her characters that brings them to vivid life. So much so that you feel you are standing next to them speaking to them and learning all about them. Furthermore, the two characters are rather mysterious. At first I wasn't sure exactly what was going on, but as usual with Elizabeth Amber I couldn't put the book down and had to see what all would be revealed.<p/><p/>Dane was definitely a tortured hero, not unusual for Ms. Amber, but I wasn't sure at first why he was so tortured. As more was discovered it made more sense. Heck, I felt tortured for him. And yet, all the way through I felt he was incredibly strong of will and mind to have made it through what he did. I seriously wanted him to find who he was looking for and to realize how much he needed a certain woman in his life, not just any woman to appease the ElseWorld Council. I was rooting for him, hoping for him and wishing I could reach into the book and poke him in the right direction. I loved how he made his stand and let the woman who owned his heart help to heal him.<p/><p/>Eva was an interesting, and incredibly complex heroine with her own secrets. One of them I knew almost from the start, but there were more to be uncovered that just added layer upon layer to this multifaceted woman. She had great reason for turmoil, but also realized that she has great reason for joy. That was something I adored about her; her capacity to find the joy in those in her life. I did get upset with her a few times. I wanted her to stand up for herself and find her own happiness, not the happiness others felt she needed to seek out. At the same time I realized that you can't just throw years of teachings and indoctrinations out the window, especially if promises were made. When she did step out of her comfort zone to find the one man who could give her everything her heart desired, I cheered and hunkered down for the fireworks.<p/><p/>I did have one issue with the book, but it was only one of personal curiosity. Nothing that pulled me from the book, just something that lingered in the back of my mind anytime I had to put the story down to attend to everyday matters. To this moment I'm still unsure who exactly the brothers are. I kept hoping that more light would be shed on their lineage - if they were from parents that we met in previous books or if they were simply a different set of Satyrs. I understood to a point that this book was apparently set fifty years after the first four books, but I wanted to know how they were related or unrelated to the first books. It didn't diminish my enjoyment at all, and doesn't even warrant a deduction in rating, it was simply my insane curiosity rearing its devious head.<p/><p/>As was typical of a tale by Ms. Amber, the secondary characters brought a multitude of emotions to the mix. From the requisite evil-doers to the girls Eva has saved, we run the gamut.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>wonderful late Victorian romantic fantasy<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=harstan">harstan</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1399345_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780758241283_BK_1_1399345" href="#previewReview_1399345" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 03, 2010: 
											In 1880 Rome, the Council orders tracker Dane Satyr to marry a human immediately.  He would prefer not to, but understands what the Sickness does to his kind.  Thus he puts aside his mission to hunt down illegal demonic immigrants crossing the barrier from ElseWorld; in order to visit the marriage broker who has found human spouses for some of his seemingly happily married peers.  Thus Dane plans to hire Eva Delacorte to find him a wife. <p/><p/>Dane and Eva are instantly attracted to one another.  However, she has a secret that if revealed could cause death to both of them.  As they fall in love while she seeks the ideal mortal for her beloved, he searches for a sex slave mob buying and selling in European high society while enemies plot to use his Achilles' weakness to destroy his heart and ultimately him.  <p/><p/>The latest Lords of Satyr historical romantic fantasy (see Nicholas, Raine, Lyon) moves forward the era from Regency to late Victorian with a refreshing female satyr.  Fast-paced as always, the love and passion between the fully developed satyrs may prove lethal to both.  Elizabeth Amber provides a wonderful brisk entry that expands her ElseWorld mythos.<p/><p/>Harriet Klausner</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>The dark sensuality of the Lords of Satyr returns to 1880s Italy, where these powerful men indulge their lust without inhibition...<P>An Appetite For Pleasure<P>When Dane Satyr approaches Eva for her services as a matchmaker, she offers him more than just introductions.

The early October breeze rattled  silvery green leaves on gnarled branches, alternately revealing  and concealing the meddling female from view. As she moved  past in a direction parallel to him, he angled his jaw so his eyes  could follow her.  <p>     Perfect. Now he wouldn't have to go hunting tonight.  <p>     But he was still in transition, not yet fully in control, and so  for now only filed the information of her arrival away to be  considered later. Breathing deep of the cool twilight, Dante  continued to slowly ease his way into a mind that belonged to  another-Dane, his reluctant host.  <p>     <i>It's for your own good</i>, Dante soothed. <i>For your protection.  I'll be gone again come morning. Relax now. Sleep.</i>  <p>     But Dane ignored this and fought on with an inner strength  that was as admirable as it was futile. Subjugation could not be  pleasant for one so strong willed. This changeover was always a  strange time and an uncomfortable one, dredging up memories  they would both prefer to forget. So Dante treaded carefully,  confident he would ultimately prevail. Just as he had on the  night of the full moon last month, and during all the Moonfuls  that had come before over the latter half of Dane's life.  <p>     In a matter of moments, he'd assumed full possession. He  was Dante now. Not a person in his own right, but rather an alternate  personality that lay dormant inside Dane and came  forth only when required. On occasions such as this one.  <p>     Slowly, he uncoiled from his crouch on the forest floor. He  shrugged broad shoulders, adjusting himself to the fit of this familiar  set of bones and flesh he'd donned. The mind and, therefore,  the body were his for the present. He would be master of  them only until dawn.  <p>     The tailored linen shirt he wore hung unbuttoned and open  in front, gleaming white against the shadowed flesh of his sculpted  chest. He flexed his hands and found them sore. He noted the  ax on the ground a yard away and the felled limbs, the piles of  encroaching vines, which had been freshly cut away from twisted  trunks nearby.  <p>     Ah, yes, he remembered now. When he'd first come into  consciousness, they'd been working.  <p>     He and Dane.  <p>     Two facets of the same mind. Possessors of a single body.  <p>     And it was a body women admired, sought, swooned over.  Six and a half feet of solid brawn, wide of shoulder, narrow of  hip. A strong column of throat, topped by a square-jawed masculine  face with a prominent blade of a nose, and crowned with  tousled sable hair. A face bearing a distinct resemblance to those  of his brothers. It would have been too handsome save for one  feature. From below straight brows, eyes of icy silver reflected  the world, making him appear otherworldly and strange. Which  he was.  <p>     Through the fabric of his trousers, he found the feature that  perhaps rendered him most aberrant. One he reveled in on  these nights. Fondly, he stroked its considerable length with the  pad of his thumb as if sharpening a precisely made weapon  meant only to give and take pleasure. Already it stood thick  and lofty and barely confined within his trousers.  <p>     This cock of theirs symbolized the entirety of Dante's role  in things. He was the fornicator-only one aspect of the whole  that was Lord Dane Satyr. Brought forth whenever this body's  lecherous need arose. He relished his role. And Dane envied  him for it. Craved it for himself.  <p>     A thrashing sound reached his ears. The woman. He'd known  she was there all along, of course, had been tracking her with a  small corner of his mind. Now his eyes found her again.  <p>     She moved heedlessly through the grove, thinking herself  alone. Now and then, she paused to tug at a branch, plucking  an unripe olive or two from it. Holding these small bits of  plunder to her nose, she then pocketed them as if gathering  samples. The olives would not be ready for picking for another  month, so he briefly wondered at her actions. But curiosity was  not a failing of his. Dane, however, suffered from a wealth of it.  And look where that had gotten them.  <p>     Beyond her, the sun had just met the horizon, a huge ball of  juicy orange jailed by black cypress spears that marched along  the hilltop opposite this one. It turned her pale skin to gold, the  shadows of her face to lovely bruises, her dark hair to coal. She  was dressed fashionably and well in a prim gray dress that  blended with the trees here. Perhaps twenty years of age or a  little older. And shapely.  <p>     He smiled. They'd only been here a few weeks, but already  he liked this new world. A Sickness had killed many of the female   species in Else World that usually served as mates for his  kind and rendered others unable to bear satyr offspring. Only  the members of the Council had the luxury of keeping their own  women. Yet here, women delivered themselves right to one's  doorstep.  <p>     His prey disappeared into a clearing and he moved after her,  keeping her in view. Her head was bent to study something she  held. A small book. A page flipped under her lace-gloved hand,  a frown creasing the creamy smooth skin between her dark  brows as she strained to make out its text in the failing light.  Whatever she read on its pages caused her to sigh in frustration.  <p>     "Honestly, <i>Maman!</i> What am I to do with these scribbles?  Couldn't you have done any better than this on so important a  matter?" Glancing around, she fanned the gilt-edged book back  and forth in one hand with obvious impatience.  <p>     Gifted with a natural stealth enhanced by a decade of training  and field experience as an Else World Tracker, Dante soundlessly  moved in her direction, intent on cutting off her exit to  the road. Though she had no way of knowing, she'd come at a  most opportune time. Night was falling. A very special night to  those of Dane's kind. Once the moon rose, all would begin.  <p>     He made a cursory, visual survey of the grove. It was protected.  Dane had bespelled its perimeter himself that very morning. If any  humans wandered too close, they would find themselves repelled  by forces they didn't understand. Since she'd managed to  trespass, he could only assume she must be of Else World blood.  <p>     His eyes swept her again. She was slender but pleasingly  curved. Fey perhaps. On this special night, her blood would be  stirring as well, though not as high as that of the satyr. Not as  high as his own. When one lived only ten hours a month, one  was understandably eager.  <p>     A light breeze gusted at his back, whooshing past him to  ripple over mistletoe, betony, chicory, fennel, rosemary, and  saffron that grew low on the forest floor. He watched it make  its way toward the woman, carrying with it his scent.  <p>     When it ruffled her skirt and pulled at tendrils of her hair,  she stilled-a woodland creature made suddenly and acutely  aware of danger. Her eyes shifted in his direction, twin flashes  of emerald. His own eyes narrowed and he smiled, pleased at  what he'd read in her glance. Recognition. Only an Else World  creature could detect the scent of another. His blood pumped a  little faster at this confirmation of his initial assumption. A female  from his own world would make for a far more interesting  engagement than a human one might have.  <p>     "This is private land." He stepped free of the forest's shadows  into the small clearing in which she stood. She whirled to  face him then, her skirts sending the leaves eddying around her.  His nostrils flared, waiting for her scent to ride the air in his direction.  He'd know what sort of creature she was soon enough.  <p>     When her fragrance reached him, its delicate, delicious impact  enfolded him like a physical caress. His senses analyzed  and sorted through its nuances, and a new prickle of awareness  swept his skin. His body reached a stunning conclusion regarding  her origins a split second before his mind did. He could actually  feel his eyes dilate, his heart gasp, his blood halt in his  veins.  <p>     "Gods, who ... <i>what</i> are you?" he demanded.  <p>     Frozen in place, they simply stared at one another with only  a dozen yards of sylvan forest and shocked silence between  them. Even the air around them seemed to hold its breath.  <p>     Then she pivoted on one dainty, booted foot and hared off.  She was getting away!  <p>     As abruptly as it had stopped, the pump of his blood resumed,  burning through him with its ecstatic gush. His hunting  instincts in full force, he loped toward her at an angle, slicing  through the forest of Dane's ancestors with ease. The tangled  underbrush aided him, snatching at her skirts and slowing her.  <p>     His hand lashed out and caught the front of her waist, low  between her ribs, pulling her back against him and stealing her  breath. She was slight compared to him; her spine easily molded  to the cavern of his broad chest. Her hips were lush against his  hard thighs. Her hair a silken sweep at his throat.  <p>     All of nature seemed to still within the forest as he gathered  her to him. He bent his head to bury his face in the tangle of her  hair, inhaling deeply. The rightness-the perfect fit of her-rocked   him to his very core.  <p>     "Who are you?" he asked again.  <p>     "No one. I'm no one."  <p>     Long moments passed and they were alone in the universe,  locked together in an intimate cocoon. The birds fell silent, but  his blood sang. The gentle music of a nearby stream ceased, but  their heartbeats thundered. His massive frame shuddered under  a flood of lust. His balls clenched, his cock hardened, his every  sense attuned to her.  <p>     He felt Dane stirring somewhere inside him, like someone  turning over in his sleep. Her pull was so strong that it was affecting  even him. <i>Who is she?</i> Dane whispered, but his question,  too, went unanswered.  <p>     Dante carefully shoved him deeper into their mutual subconscious,  where he must remain until this night was done.  He'd been protecting him for the past thirteen years and saw no  reason to stop now. Not while the danger to them still existed  in this world.  <p>     Under his palm, he felt the firm stays beneath her gray silk  gown. He considered the swiftest way to convince her to allow  him to remove them. "Don't fear us. We're like you."  <p>     "Us?" She shook her head and tugged at his hands on her  waist, resisting the pull he was exerting on her person and her  senses. "What are you talking about, monsieur? I only wandered  here by mistake, looking for flowers for my table tonight. I  didn't know the house was occupied. If you'll let me go-my  conveyance is just over there." She gestured toward the road,  then as she drew her arm back down again, slammed the point  of her elbow into his rib, struggling.  <p>     He frowned, startled, unable to comprehend that she might  not want him. "Why do you fight?" he murmured into her hair,  his voice hot and dark. "Night comes, and with it the Calling."  <p>     She gasped, whipping her head around. Her eyes were wary,  but in their depths awareness flickered.  <p>     The backs of his fingers traced her pale cheek. "You know of  what we speak," he accused softly. "Of the Change that will  come over us when the sun dies." Each word was bespelled, an  enticement meant to lull her senses.   <p>     "No." She shook her head as if to shake off his touch, his enchantments,  and his intentions toward her. He felt her magic  dueling his for supremacy, and it sent a prurient thrill through  him. But within seconds, his magic had crept into her consciousness,  visibly affecting her. Her body remained half turned away,  but she'd relaxed, no longer poised to flee. Her expression softened  and a flush of pink stole across her cheeks. Her fingers  rose to lightly brush her lips; then they dropped to the neckline  of her bodice, restlessly tracing its lace.  <p>     "Gods," he whispered. "Everyone believed creatures such as  you to be only a myth." He tucked a curl of her hair behind her  ear, studying every nuance of her upturned face, wondering  about her. Who she was. Why she'd come here.  <p>     "I'm fey," she protested weakly.  <p>     He chuckled. "Little liar."  <p>     Dane with his insatiable need to know would have questions  for her when they met with the coming of morning. Let him  find answers then. Tonight was for pleasure. His palm warmed  on her cheek, casting a Calm over her.  <p>     "Stay," he murmured. "Stay with us tonight."  <p>     Her will to fight him-to fight her own nature-faltered.  Her shoulders softened and her arms went lax. Something hit  the toe of his boot. Her little book. Her head lay back on his  shoulder and he felt her go boneless against him. When her lips  turned into his throat, he knew he'd won her. But it wasn't enough  that his magic wiles should woo her anymore. He wanted her  with him, desiring him with her body and spirit, and would not  be satisfied until she begged him to fill her. He brought her fingers  up to the fastenings of her bodice and helped her to work  the first of them free.  <p>     A strange and sudden numbness came over him then, and  his own fingers fumbled, becoming uncoordinated and uncertain.  His hold on her slackened. Not because she'd renewed her  puny efforts to shake him off but because of ... something else.  Something was wrong.  <p>     Dante felt himself waver, felt his consciousness ripple like  the waves on a pond that had been disturbed. His hands dropped  away from her as the shadow of another presence crowded around  the edges of his mind. Dane? No, it couldn't be. Yet it was.  <p>     But Dane had never resurfaced during a carnal encounter. It  wasn't safe. What if <i>they</i> came again and took him back to that  awful place? It had driven him into an asylum before. Next  time, it might kill him. Dante couldn't let that happen! Protecting  Dane was what he lived for.  <p>     <i>Don't you remember how things were ... before?</i> Dante  warned. <i>Don't you value your sanity? You must hide. Sleep</i>, he  crooned.  <p>     <i>Get out of my head, damn you!</i> Dane bit out. <i>I don't need  you!</i>  <p>     Stunned, Dante could only stand there, arms useless at his  sides as he faded further still, inexorably losing his grip on ...  <p>  <p>     Dane sucked in a sharp intake of breath, inhaling his own  soul back into his flesh. His mind, his very essence, poured back  into his body like wine into a goblet. He was himself again. Alone  in his own skin.  <p>     He opened his eyes, blinking at the world, seeing it at first as  if he were under water. Drowning. He was disoriented, his vision  blurred, almost losing his balance for a moment before  managing to right himself. His hands found an anchor. A woman.  <p>     Her back was against him; her body a warm, pliant, delicious  weight in his arms. His palms shaped her ribs, stroking  the turn of her waist and hips. Somehow he knew he must hold  on to her, as if she were his conduit to consciousness. To salvation.  <p>     Things swam back into focus as disconnected flashes. He  was in the grove, just as he last remembered himself. He'd been  working here on his newly acquired property earlier, hacking  away vines to keep them from suffocating the trees.  <p>     Then that whoreson phantom Dante had come. Had taken  control of him, of his mind, his body. Intending to use it to fuck  the night away in his stead. Claiming it was all done for Dane's  own good-same as every Moonful. But Dane had interrupted  the bastard this time!  <p>     How he'd done so was a matter of question. It had something  to do with her, this woman who inexplicably stood here  with him in the gathering gloom, her head upon his chest, her  exquisite body unresisting under his intimate exploration.  <p>     Her pale gray bodice was partially unbuttoned, revealing the  curves of full, white, perfect breasts. He'd long had a particular  affection for this portion of a woman's anatomy. As if in a dream,  he watched his hand slip between fabric and flesh, catching on  the fine gold chains she wore. Her breast was cool under his  fingers, and firm. He found and teased a rosy nipple, dragging  the cold metal links over and over it until it drew up tight.  <p>     She moaned and touched his wrist, her thighs shifting restlessly  against his. His cock surged and he gasped, almost brought  to his knees by the sensation. He found its prodigious length  with his hand, gripping it through lightweight black wool that  could scarcely contain it.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>DANE&#58; THE LORDS OF SATYR</b> by <b>ELIZABETH AMBER</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Elizabeth Amber.
