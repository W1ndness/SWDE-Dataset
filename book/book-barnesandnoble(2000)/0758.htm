			Movie-Tie-in</li></ul></div></div><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>An electrifying first novel that shocks by its language, its circumstances, and its brutal honesty, Push recounts a young black street-girl's horrendous and redemptive journey through a Harlem inferno. For Precious Jones, 16 and pregnant with her father's child, miraculous hope appears and the world begins to open up for her when a courageous, determined teacher bullies, cajoles, and inspires her to learn to read, to define her own feelings and set them down in a diary.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>With this much anticipated first novel, told from the point of view of an illiterate, brutalized Harlem teenager, Sapphire (American Dreams), a writer affiliated with the Nuyorican poets, charts the psychic damage of the most ghettoized of inner-city inhabitants. Obese, dark-skinned, HIV-positive, bullied by her sexually abusive mother, Clareece, Precious Jones is, at the novel's outset, pregnant for the second time with her father's child. (Precious had her first daughter at 12, named Little Mongo, "short for Mongoloid Down Sinder, which is what she is; sometimes what I feel I is. I feel so stupid sometimes. So ugly, worth nuffin.") Referred to a pilot program by an unusually solicitous principal, Precious comes under the experimental pedagogy of a lesbian miracle worker named, implausibly enough, Blue Rain. Under her angelic mentorship, Precious, who has never before experienced real nurturing, learns to voice her long suppressed feelings in a journal. As her language skills improve, she finds sustenance in writing poetry, in friendships and in support groups-one for "insect" survivors and one for HIV-positive teens. It is here that Sapphire falters, as her slim and harrowing novel, with its references to Harriet Tubman, Langston Hughes and The Color Purple (a parallel the author hints at again and again), becomes a conventional, albeit dark and unresolved, allegory about redemption. The ending, composed of excerpts from the journals of Precious's classmates, lends heightened realism and a wider scope to the narrative, but also gives it a quality of incompleteness. Sapphire has created a remarkable heroine in Precious, whose first-person street talk is by turns blisteringly savvy, rawly lyrical, hilariously pig-headed and wrenchingly vulnerable. Yet that voice begs to be heard in a larger novel of more depth and complexity. 150,000 first printing; first serial to the New Yorker; audio rights to Random; foreign rights sold to England, France, Germany, Holland, Portugal and Brazil.

											&quot;Precious&quot; By: Sapphire is one of the best books I ever read. It's a life changing story. It tells about the life of an illiterate sixteen year old named Precious Jones. She was raped by her father and beat by her mother. Precious had two kids by her father who later died of AIDs. After a while she meets a determined and radical teacher who teaches her to read and write. I really enjoyed this book because it is written as if precious is telling her story. This story could change the way that most teens live their lives. Many teens could be living the same life that precious lived. This story could show them that no matter what comes along, you can continue to live your life.  Precious was picked on, beat, and raped. She finally found someone she could tell her story to, and a way she could express her feelings. She wrote poems and stories about her life. She learned very slowly but her teacher Ms. Rain was by her side every step of the way. This story taught me to be thankful for what I have because everyone does not have the things I have.  Precious never had any friends until she started to attend school at the Higher Education Alternative/ Each One Teach One. She meets a lot of people who were going through the things similar to what she was going through. I would recommend others to read this book because it's life changing. I think we should read this book in school because it teaches may lessons.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Must Read<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1388808_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780307474841_BK_1_1388808" href="#previewReview_1388808" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 16, 2010: 
											When reading this book I was incrediablly sceptable at first due to the fragments and the storyline. But as soon as I started I was blown away at the strengh and endurence this character has and how she was able to remove herself from the worse situation possible. As the book goes on you begin to see the improvments she is making for herself and for her future, and you are in awe considering where she started. This is a book that is incrediably hard to read at times but well worth the conquest. It forces you to look inside yourself again and consider if you are selling your abilities short, and asking yourself how strong and willing your soul really is to survive.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>An electrifying first novel that shocks by its language, its circumstances, and its brutal honesty, Push recounts a young black street-girl's horrendous and redemptive journey through a Harlem inferno.

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>A first novel by a highly touted African American poet will have an ambitious 150,000-copy first printing.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Poet Sapphire's slim first novel draws on her experience as a performance artist and literacy teacher&#58; She tells her sad but sentimentally uplifting story in the voice of a 17-year-old illiterate from Harlem, and the result is more sociological (in the Ricki Lake mold) than literary.<P>Clareece Precious Jones is a study in abuse. Continually raped by her father since the age of five, she's now pregnant for the second time with his baby, the first having been born with Down's syndrome when Precious was 12. Meantime, her mother is no help, calling the overweight girl a "fat cunt bucket slut," beating her at will, and satisfying her own bizarre sexual needs from her daughter. Schools have also all failed her; teachers find her "uncooperative," and she considers her last a "retarded hoe." Finally, Precious enrolls in a Harlem alternative school where she begins the tough climb out of illiteracy. No longer dreaming impossible ideas about rappers and movie star fame, she joins six others in a basic-skills class run by Blue Rain, a self-proclaimed lesbian who isn't afraid to editorialize in class. In short order, Precious discovers the joys of the alphabet and journal-writing, the pleasures of owning books and composing poetry. Although she raises herself to a seventh-grade level by narrative's end, she also finds out she's HIV positive. All of this is transcribed in a phonetic spelling that's supposed to reflect Precious's actual abilities, but seems condescending&#151;and woefully unauthentic&#151;since Sapphire often loses control of the voice. The homage to The Color Purple ("One thing I say about Farrakhan and Alice Walker they help me like being black") highlights Sapphire's commercial aspirations, as well as, by contrast, her technical inadequacies.<P> A maudlin (at times pornographic) advertisement for the power of literacy and the value of recovery groups.<P>

\
<b>ABOUT THIS GUIDE</b><br>
\
The questions, discussion topics, and author biography that follow are intended to enhance
\
your group's reading of Sapphire's Push. We hope they will aid your understanding of this
\
vibrant and powerful first novel by one of America's most controversial poets.
\
"Don't nobody want me. Don't nobody need me. I know who I am.... Ugly black grease to
\
be wipe away, punish, kilt, changed, finded a job for" [p. 31]. This is the voice of Precious
\
Jones, a viciously abused Harlem girl. At sixteen, Precious is pregnant�for the second
\
time�with her own father's child, and regularly beaten and ordered around by her jealous,
\
reclusive mother. Though she sits dutifully in class every day� "I always did like school,
\
jus' seem school never did like me" [p. 36]�she has remained completely illiterate. Her life
\
seems set to repeat the self-destructive pattern of her mother's, until her principal sends her
\
to an alternative reading class where, with the help of a dedicated teacher and fellow
\
students who have undergone experiences as harrowing as her own, she begins an
\
intoxicating discovery of words, friendship, and, in the process, herself.
\
Precious's voice�stark and crude yet filled with raw intelligence and even humor�
\
demands to be heard and, once heard, will prove unforgettable.<p>
\
<b>FOR DISCUSSION</b><br>
\
1. What does this story tell us about the inadequacy of ordinary schools to deal with
\
students' problems and with their resulting learning handicaps? "I got A in English and
\
never say nuffin', do nuffin'" [p. 49], Precious says. Precious's principal in effect tells her
\
teacher to give up on her, saying, "Focus on the ones who can learn" [p. 37]. Is this an
\
understandable or forgivable attitude? How would you describe Mr. Wicher and his
\
teaching methods? Is he merely a coward or is he trying his best?<p>
\
2. "The tesses paint a picture of me wif no brain," says Precious. "The tesses paint a picture
\
of me an' my muver�my whole family, we more than dumb, we invisible" [p. 30]. In what
\
way are Precious and her family members invisible to the larger world? If you have read
\
Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, can you compare the way the two authors use the metaphor
\
of invisibility for their characters?<p>
\
3. During the course of the story, Precious is obliged to confront her own prejudices and
\
modify or reject them. Her experience with the Hispanic EMS man makes her look at
\
Hispanics for the first time as human beings like herself; her friendship with Ms. Rain and
\
Jermaine makes her reexamine her knee�jerk homophobia. Early in the novel she says, "I
\
hate crack addicts. They give the race a bad name" [p. 14], but later she questions that
\
uncompromising position. In an interview, Sapphire said of Precious that "she doesn't
\
know that hating gay people or hating Jews or hating foreigners is detrimental to her"
\
(Interview, June 1996). Why is it detrimental to her? Why is it imperative that she lose her
\
prejudices before she, herself, can be helped?<p>
\
4. How would you describe Precious's self-image at the beginning of the book, and how
\
would you describe it at the end? How have her friends and supporters succeeded in
\
helping to alter her view of herself?<p>
\
5. What is Precious's attitude toward Louis Farrakhan and his movement at the beginning
\
of the story? How does this attitude change during the course of her education? Why have
\
Farrakhan and his opinions become such a vital part of her worldview? What do you
\
deduce the author's attitude toward him to be?<p>
\
6. A famous�or perhaps infamous�Labor Department study, the Moynihan Report,
\
blamed the absence of fathers and the dominance of women (rather than economic and
\
racial inequality) for the problems confronting the African American family. Many black
\
scholars and activists have argued against the report's conclusions. Which side of the
\
argument do you believe Push to support?<p>
\
7. Push presents what one reviewer called "one of the most disturbing
\
portraits of motherhood ever published" (City Paper , November 1996).
\
How would you explain or interpret Precious' s mother's behavior?<p>
\
8. "Miz Rain say we is a nation of raped children, that the black man in America today is
\
the product of rape" [pp. 68�69]. What does Ms. Rain mean by this metaphor, and does it
\
strike you as an accurate one?<p>
\
9. Precious tells Ms. Rain that the welfare helps her mother, to which Ms. Rain responds,
\
"When you get home from the hospital look and see how much welfare has helped your
\
mother" [p. 73]. What does this novel indicate about abuses and inadequacies in the
\
system? How might an ideal system be constructed?<p>
\
10. Precious's file reflects the government "workfare" point of view, that Precious should
\
already be earning her own living, possibly as a home attendant. Precious objects violently
\
to this idea. Can you understand the social worker's point of view? Have Precious's and
\
Jermaine's arguments [pp. 121�123] changed any opinions you previously held on this
\
subject?<p>
\
11. "Miz Rain say value. Values determine how we live much as money do. I say Miz Rain
\
stupid there. All I can think she don't know to have NOTHIN'" [p. 64]. Which opinion do
\
you agree with, or is there something to be said for both? What answer, if any, does the
\
novel offer?<p>
\
12. "One of the myths we've been taught," Sapphire has said, "is that oppression creates
\
moral superiority. I'm here to tell you that the more oppressed a person is, the more
\
oppressive they will be" (Bomb, Fall 1996). How does the novel illustrate the concept of
\
the cycle of abuse? How does Precious break that cycle, and what aspects of her own
\
character enable her to do so?<p>
\
13. Push has been called a Dickensian novel, to which Sapphire has
\
responded, "Part of what's so wrong in this story is that we're not in a
\
Dickensian era. Those things shouldn't be happening in a post�industrial
\
society" (Bomb, Fall 1996). She sees the novel as "an indictment of
\
American culture, which is both black and white" (ibid). What aspects of
\
our culture have enabled the inequities described in the novel to develop?
\
Would you say that contemporary American cities consist, as Dickens's
\
London was said to, of two entirely different cultures, the rich one and the
\
poor?<p>
\
14. Why do you think Sapphire has chosen to end the story where she does? Does the
\
book end on a sad or hopeful note? What sort of future do you envision for Precious?<p>
\
15. What is the significance of the novel's title, Push? At what points in her life is Precious
\
enjoined to "push"? What is meant by this word, and how does Precious respond to the
\
injunctions?

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P>1<br><br>I was left back when I was twelve because I had a baby for my fahver. That was in 1983. I was out of school for a year. This gonna be my second baby. My daughter got Down Sinder. She's retarded. I had got left back in the second grade too, when I was seven, 'cause I couldn't read (and I still peed on myself). I should be in the eleventh grade, getting ready to go into the twelf' grade so I can gone 'n graduate. But I'm not. I'm in the ninfe grade.<br><br>I got suspended from school 'cause I'm pregnant which I don't think is fair. I ain' did nothin'!<br><br>My name is Claireece Precious Jones. I don't know why I'm telling you that. Guess 'cause I don't know how far I'm gonna go with this story, or whether it's even a story or why I'm talkin'; whether I'm gonna start from the beginning or right from here or two weeks from now. Two weeks from now? Sure you can do anything when you talking or writing, it's not like living when you can only do what you doing. Some people tell a story 'n it don't make no sense or be true. But I'm gonna try to make sense and tell the truth, else what's the fucking use? Ain' enough lies and shit out there already?<br><br>So, OK, it's Thursday, September twenty-four 1987 and I'm walking down the hall. I look good, smell good-fresh, clean. It's hot but I do not take off my leather jacket even though it's hot, it might get stolen or lost. Indian summer, Mr Wicher say. I don't know why he call it that. What he mean is, it's hot, 90 degrees, like summer days. And there is no, none, I mean none, air conditioning in this mutherfucking building. The building I'm talking about is, of course, I.S. 146 on 134th Street between Lenox Avenue and Adam ClaytonPowell Jr Blvd. I am walking down the hall from homeroom to first period maff. Why they put some shit like maff first period I do not know. Maybe to gone 'n git it over with. I actually don't mind maff as much as I had thought I would. I jus' fall in Mr Wicher's class sit down. We don't have assigned seats in Mr Wicher's class, we can sit anywhere we want. I sit in the same seat everyday, in the back, last row, next to the door. Even though I know that back door be locked. I don't say nuffin' to him. He don't say nuffin' to me, now. First day he say, "Class turn the book pages to page 122 please." I don't move. He say, "Miss Jones, I said turn the book pages to page 122." I say, "Mutherfucker I ain't deaf!" The whole class laugh. He turn red. He slam his han' down on the book and say, "Try to have some discipline." He a skinny little white man about five feets four inches. A peckerwood as my mother would say. I look at him 'n say, "I can slam too. You wanna slam?" 'N I pick up my book 'n slam it down on the desk hard. The class laugh some more. He say, "Miss Jones I would appreciate it if you would leave the room right NOW." I say, "I ain' going nowhere mutherfucker till the bell ring. I came here to learn maff and you gon' teach me." He look like a bitch just got a train pult on her. He don't know what to do. He try to recoup, be cool, say, "Well, if you want to learn, calm down--" "I'm calm," I tell him. He say, "If you want to learn, shut up and open your book." His face is red, he is shaking. I back off. I have won. I guess.<br><br>I didn't want to hurt him or embarrass him like that you know. But I couldn't let him, anybody, know, page 122 look like page 152, 22, 3, 6, 5--all the pages look alike to me. 'N I really do want to learn. Everyday I tell myself something gonna happen, some shit like on TV. I'm gonna break through or somebody gonna break through to me--I'm gonna learn, catch up, be normal, change my seat to the front of the class. But again, it has not been that day.<br><br>But thas the first day I'm telling you about. Today is not the first day and like I said I was on my way to maff class when Mrs Lichenstein snatch me out the hall to her office. I'm really mad 'cause actually I like maff even though I don't do nuffin', don't open my book even. I jus' sit there for fifty minutes. I don't cause trouble. In fac' some of the other natives get restless I break on 'em. I say, "Shut up mutherfuckers I'm tryin' to learn something." First they laugh like trying to pull me into fuckin' with Mr Wicher and disrupting the class. Then I get up 'n say, "Shut up mutherfuckers I'm tryin' to learn something." The coons clowning look confuse, Mr Wicher look confuse. But I'm big, five feet nine-ten, I weigh over two hundred pounds. Kids is scared of me. "Coon fool," I tell one kid done jumped up. "Sit down, stop ackin' silly." Mr Wicher look at me confuse but grateful. I'm like the polices for Mr Wicher. I keep law and order. I like him, I pretend he is my husband and we live together in Weschesser, wherever that is.<br><br>I can see by his eyes Mr Wicher like me too. I wish I could tell him about all the pages being the same but I can't. I'm getting pretty good grades. I usually do. I just wanna gone get the fuck out of I.S. 146 and go to high school and get my diploma.<br><br>Anyway I'm in Mrs Lichenstein's office. She's looking at me, I'm looking at her. I don't say nuffin'. Finally she say, "So Claireece, I see we're expecting a little visitor." But it's not like a question, she's telling me. I still don't say nuffin'. She staring at me, from behind her big wooden desk, she got her white bitch hands folded together on top her desk.<br><br>"Claireece."<br><br>Everybody call me Precious. I got three names--Claireece Precious Jones. Only mutherfuckers I hate call me Claireece.<br><br>"How old are you Claireece?"<br><br>White cunt box got my file on her desk. I see it. I ain't that late to lunch. Bitch know how old I am.<br><br>"Sixteen is ahh rather ahh"--she clear her throat--"old to still be in junior high school."<br><br>I still don't say nuffin'. She know so much let her ass do the talking.<br><br>"Come now, you are pregnant, aren't you Claireece?"<br><br>She asking now, a few seconds ago the hoe just knew what I was.<br><br>"Claireece?"<br><br>She tryin' to talk all gentle now and shit.<br><br>"Claireece, I'm talking to you."<br><br>I still don't say nuffin'. This hoe is keeping me from maff class. I like maff class. Mr Wicher like me in there, need me to keep those rowdy niggers in line. He nice, wear a dope suit every day. He do not come to school looking like some of these other nasty ass teachers.<br><br>"I don't want to miss no more of maff class," I tell stupid ass Mrs Lichenstein.<br><br>She look at me like I said I wanna suck a dog's dick or some shit. What's with this cunt bucket? (That's what my muver call women she don't like, cunt buckets. I kinda get it and I kinda don't get it, but I like the way it sounds so I say it too.)<br><br>I get up to go, Mrs Lichenstein ax me to please sit down, she not through with me yet. But I'm through with her, thas what she don't get.<br><br>"This is your second baby?" she says. I wonder what else it say in that file with my name on it. I hate her.<br><br>"I think we should have a parent-teacher conference Claireece--me, you, and your mom."<br><br>"For what?" I say. "I ain' done nuffin'. I doose my work. I ain' in no trouble. My grades is good."<br><br>Mrs Lichenstein look at me like I got three arms or a bad odor out my pussy or something.<br><br>What my muver gon' do I want to say. What is she gonna do? But I don't say that. I jus' say, "My muver is busy. "<br><br>"Well maybe I could arrange to come to your house--" The look on my face musta hit her, which is what I was gonna do if she said one more word. Come to my house! Nosy ass white bitch! I don't think so! We don't be coming to your house in Weschesser or wherever the fuck you freaks live. Well I be damned, I done heard everything, white bitch wanna visit.<br><br>"Well then Claireece, I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you--"<br><br>"For what!"<br><br>"You're pregnant and--"<br><br>"You can't suspend me for being pregnant, I got rights!"<br><br>"Your attitude Claireece is one of total uncooperation--"<br><br>I reached over the desk. I was gonna yank her fat ass out that chair. She fell backwards trying to get away from me 'n started screaming, "SECURITY SECURITY!"<br><br>I was out the door and on the street and I could still hear her stupid ass screaming, "SECURITY SECURITY!"<br><br>"Precious!" That's my mother calling me.<br><br>I don't say nothin'. She been staring at my stomach. I know what's coming. I keep washing dishes. We had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, and Wonder bread for dinner. I don't know how many months pregnant I am. I don't wanna stand here 'n hear Mama call me slut. Holler 'n shout on me all day like she did the last time. Slut! Nasty ass tramp! What you been doin'! Who! Who! WHOoooo like owl in Walt Disney movie I seen one time. Whooo?

No man was never nice like that to me before. I ask at the hospital behind him, "Where that guy help me?" They say, "Hush girl you jus' had a baby."<br><br>But I can't hush 'cause they keep asking me questions. My name? Precious Jones. Claireece Precious Jones to be exact. Birth date? November 4, 1970. Where? "Here," I say, "right chere in Harlem Hospital." "Nineteen seventy?" the nurse say confuse quiet. Then she say, "How old are you?" I say, "Twelve." I was heavy at twelve too, nobody get I'm twelve 'less I tell them. I'm tall. I jus' know I'm over two hundred 'cause the needle on the scale in the bathroom stop there it don't can go no further. Last time they want to weigh me at school I say no. Why for, I know I'm fat. So what. Next topic for the day.<br><br>But this not school nurse now, this Harlem Hospital where I was borned, where me and my baby got tooked after it was borned on the kitchen floor at 444 Lenox Avenue. This nurse slim butter-color woman. She lighter than some Spanish womens but I know she black. I can tell. It's something about being a nigger ain't color. This nurse same as me. A lot of black people with nurse cap or big car or light skin same as me but don't know it. I'm so tired I jus' want to disappear. I wish Miss Butter would leave me alone but she jus' staring at me, her eyes getting bigger and bigger. She say she need to get some more information for the birth certificate.<br><br>It still tripping me out that I had a baby. I mean I knew I was pregnant, knew how I got pregnant.

I'm twelve now, I been knowing about that since I was five or six, maybe I always known about pussy and dick. I can't remember not knowing. No, I can't remember a time I did not know. But thas all I knowed. I didn't know how long it take, what's happening inside, nothing, I didn't know nothing.<br><br>The nurse is saying something I don't hear. I hear kids at school. Boy say I'm laffing ugly. He say, "Claireece is so ugly she laffing ugly." His fren' say, "No, that fat bitch is crying ugly." Laff laff. Why I'm thinking about those stupid boys now I don't know.<br><br>"Mother," she say. "What's your mother's name?" I say, "Mary L Johnston" (L for Lee but my mother don't like Lee, soun' too country). "Where your mother born," she say. I say, "Greenwood, Mississippi." Nurse say, "You ever been there?" I say, "Naw, I never been nowhere." She say, "Reason I ask is I'm from Greenwood, Mississippi, myself." I say, "Oh," 'cause I know I'm spozed to say something.<br><br>"Father," she say. "What's your daddy's name?"<br><br>"Carl Kenwood Jones, born in the Bronx."<br><br>She say, "What's the baby's father's name?"<br><br>I say, "Carl Kenwood Jones, born in the same Bronx."<br><br><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>
