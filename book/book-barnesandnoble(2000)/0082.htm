This regularly gets her into trouble with her "maam" and "daed," who feel she shirks her duties to "tend to her critters." Gabe Swartz loves Melinda and wants to make her his wife, but even he has a hard time understanding why she seems to prefer the company of her animal friends to him. Worlds collide when Melinda delivers an ultimatum:  Gabe must agree to give up hunting, a hobby he loves and believes to be useful, or she won't marry him. Will Melinda and Gabe be able to overcome their differences, or will they end up losing their chance for love and marriage?\

Brunstetter <br>All right reserved.</b><br> <b> ISBN&#58; 978-1-59789-611-5 </b><br> <br><br>   <br><b> Chapter One </b>  Melinda Andrews hurried across the grass, eager to arrive  at her favorite spot. Just a few more steps, and there it was-dappled   canopies of maple, hickory, cedar, and pine towering  over a carpet of lush green leaves and fragrant needles. She  drew in a deep breath, relishing the woodsy scent. The sun had  tried all morning to overcome the low-hanging clouds. It had  finally made an appearance, and Melinda planned to enjoy each  moment she could spend here.  <p>     She slowed her pace and crept through the forest, being careful  not to snag her long, dark blue dress or matching apron on  any low-hanging branches. After awhile, she came to a clearing  with several downed trees. "This looks like the perfect place for  me to sit and draw," she murmured.  <p>     Taking a seat on a nearby log, Melinda pulled her drawing  tablet and pencil from the canvas tote she'd brought along.  "Where are you, deer friends?"  <p>     The only movement was the flitter of leaves as the wind blew  softly against the trees.  <p>     Melinda spotted a cluster of wild yellow crocuses peeking  through a clump of grass. Spring was her favorite time of the  year, with new life bursting forth everywhere. She lifted her  pencil, ready to sketch a tan-colored rabbit that had hopped  onto the scene, when two does stepped into the clearing.  <p>     "You're so beautiful," she whispered.  <p>     The does lifted their heads in curiosity as a hawk soared high  overhead.  <p>     Melinda watched the deer nibble on leaves while she sketched  their picture. Her stomach rumbled, which caused her to think  about the lemon sponge cake Papa Noah had made last night.  She'd had a sliver of it for breakfast this morning, and it had  been delicious. She thought her stepfather was the best cook in  all of Webster County, Missouri.  <p>     Melinda had been six years old when her real father had  been hit by a car and killed. Shortly after his death, her mother  had given up her career of telling jokes and yodeling among the  English. She and Melinda had caught the bus from Branson  to Seymour and come to live with Grandpa and Grandma  Stutzman in the Amish community where Melinda's mother  had been raised.  <p>     Even though Melinda had been young back then, she  remembered many things about their arrival in Webster County.  She especially recalled meeting her aunt, Susie Stutzman, for the  first time. Susie was Grandma's youngest child, and she was a  year older than Melinda. Melinda and Susie had become friends  right away and had remained so ever since.  <p>     Melinda smiled at the memory of seeing her aunt dressed in  a long blue dress with a small white <i>kapp</i> perched on top of her  head. "Plain clothes" is what Mama had told Melinda. "My folks  follow the customs and rules of the Amish church, and they live  differently than we're used to living."  <p>     Melinda hadn't minded wearing the unusual clothes, for it  seemed as if she were playing dress-up at first. The strange rules  and numerous jobs Grandma Stutzman had expected her to do  were the hardest part. She remembered, too, that Mama hadn't  seemed too happy when they first came home-not until Noah  Hertzler had started hanging around, taking an interest in her.  Melinda had figured Noah would be her new daddy even before  Mama had said she loved him. She'd been real pleased when  they'd decided to get married.  <p> Melinda lifted her face to the sun as thoughts of marriage  made her think of Gabe Swartz, who had begun courting her  a few months ago. Gabe had hazel-colored eyes with little green  specks and brown hair that curled around his ears. He was tall  and slender yet strong and able-bodied. Melinda had developed  a crush on him when they were attending the one-room schoolhouse  down the road.  <p>     When Gabe, who'd been a year ahead of Melinda in school,  graduated from eighth grade and began learning the trade of  woodworking under his dad's tutelage, she missed seeing him  every day and looked forward to their every-other-Sunday church  services, where Gabe and his family would also be in attendance.  Now Gabe, who had recently turned twenty, worked full-time at  his father's woodworking shop.  <p>     When Melinda had finished school, she'd begun her  vocational training at home with her mother, where she learned  various household chores that would prepare her for marriage.  Then a year ago, she'd begun working part-time for Dr. Franklin,  the local veterinarian. At first it was just cleanup work, as well  as feeding, watering, and exercising some of the animal patients.  But later, when the doctor realized how much Melinda cared  for the animals and noticed her special way with them, he had  allowed her to assist him with minor things. Melinda had done  everything from holding a dog while it received a shot or had  its nails clipped, to giving flea baths and bringing animals from  their cages into the operating room.  <p>     "You've been blessed with a unique gift," Dr. Franklin had  told Melinda the other day while she held a nervous kitten about  to receive its first shot. "Have you ever considered becoming a  veterinarian's technical assistant or even a vet?"  <p>     Melinda had to admit that the thought of becoming a vet had  crossed her mind, but she figured it was an impossible dream.  Not only was she lacking in education, but going to college and  then on to a school of veterinary medicine would mean leaving  the Amish faith. Since she'd been baptized and joined the Amish  church a year ago, it would affect her whole family if she left the  faith and became part of the English world.  <p>     Melinda remembered several years ago, before their old  bishop died and John Frey had taken his place, a young man  named Abner had left home during his running-around years,  and he'd ended up coming back a few months later, saying it  was too hard being away from his family. As a young woman,  her own mother had left the Amish faith for ten years, trying to  make a name for herself in the entertainment business.  <p>     <i>It would probably break Mama's heart if I left home the way she  did when she was my age</i>, Melinda thought. <i>And what would it do  to my relationship with Gabe?</i> She shook her head. <i>No, becoming a  vet is most likely just an impossible dream. I'll probably never leave my  home here in Webster County.</i>  <p>                             * * *  <p>  "I can't believe Melinda's not back yet." Faith placed a sack of  flour on the counter and turned to face her mother and youngest  sister, who sat at the kitchen table. "She said she was going for a  short walk and would be here in plenty of time to help with the  baking, but she must have lost track of time."  <p>     Susie, Faith's sister who had recently turned twenty, sighed.  "Knowing Melinda, she's most likely off taking care of one of  her critters or out in the woods sketching pictures of the deer."  <p>     Faith nodded. "You're probably right. My daughter has been  taking in injured and orphaned animals ever since she was a little  girl. It's not gotten any better since she became a young woman,  either. Sometimes I wonder if Melinda will ever grow up."  <p>     "Just because she likes helping animals doesn't mean she's  not mature," Faith's mother put in. "She wouldn't be able to  work for Dr. Franklin if she wasn't grown up enough to make  good decisions."  <p>     Faith wrinkled her forehead. She didn't know why her  mother was sticking up for Melinda. She sure hadn't taken  Faith's side of things when Faith was Melinda's age. <i>Of course</i>,  Faith reasoned, <i>back then I was headstrong and disobedient, running  off to do my own thing in the modern world. Mama only saw me as a  rebellious teenager, not as a mature woman who made good decisions</i>.  <p>     "Be that as it may," Faith said as she pulled out a rolling pin,  "Melinda's showing her immaturity this morning by not keeping  her word and being here to help us with the baking."  <p>     "Would you like me to go look for her?" Susie offered.  <p>     Faith pursed her lips and finally nodded. "That's a good idea,  since she's obviously not planning to come back anytime soon of  her own accord."  <p>     Susie stood. "I'll check the barn first. If she's not there, I'll  head for the woods."  <p>     As Susie scurried out the door, Faith moved over to the table  and took a seat across from her mother. "Since we don't have  the help of either of our daughters at the moment, why don't  the two of us sit and visit over another cup of tea?"  <p>     Mama smiled and pushed back her metal-framed glasses,  which had slipped to the end of her nose. "Sounds good  to me."  <p>     "You know, it's not just Melinda's preoccupation with her  animal friends that bothers me," Faith said while pouring her  mother a cup of tea.  <p>     "What else is bothering you?"  <p>     "I'm concerned because Melinda's been acting kind of  strange."  <p>     Mama's eyebrows lifted as a deep wrinkle formed above her  nose. "Strange in what way?"  <p>     "Besides the fact that I have to stay after Melinda to get her  chores done because she's too busy tending her animal friends,  she seems to be off in her own little world. It's like her thoughts  are somewhere else most of the time."  <p>     "I think you need to be more patient with Melinda. From  what I can tell, she and Gabe Swartz are getting serious. I think  it's just a matter of time until they become betrothed." Mama  smiled. "Once that happens, I'm sure Melinda will settle down  and act more like the mature woman you want her to be."  <p>     Faith poured herself a cup of tea and took a sip. "I hope  you're right about that, Mama. <i>Jah</i>, I surely do."  <p>                             * * *  <p>  Susie had gone a short ways into the woods when she spotted  Melinda sitting on a log with her drawing tablet. Susie was  tempted to scold her niece for wasting time and trying to get  out of work she should be doing, but she figured if she said too  much, she and Melinda would probably end up arguing. Ever  since Melinda had been a young girl, she had enjoyed spending  time with animals. Susie used to think that once Melinda grew  up, she would focus on the important things in life. But no, Melinda kept drawing and daydreaming, shirking her duties at  the house, and causing her mother to send Susie after her on  many occasions.  <p>     A twig snapped as Susie took a step toward the log. She halted  and held her breath. Should she sneak up on Melinda and take  her by surprise or make a loud noise so Melinda would know  she was coming? Deciding on the latter, Susie moved closer and  cleared her throat.  <p>     Melinda, engrossed in her artwork, didn't budge.  <p>     Susie held her hands above Melinda's head and clapped.  "Hey!"  <p>     Melinda jumped, and the deer she'd been drawing bolted  into the protection of the thick pine forest.  <p>     "Thanks a lot!" Melinda spun around and glared at Susie.  "You've scared away my subjects, and they probably won't be  back. Leastways not anytime soon."  <p>     "Sorry about that," Susie mumbled. She glanced at Melinda's  drawing tablet and couldn't help but be impressed with what  she saw. Despite the fact that Melinda drew well, was it really  necessary to spend every free moment-and some time that was  stolen-sketching her woodland friends?  <p>     Melinda stood and shook her finger at Susie. "I don't think  you're one bit sorry. You look rather pleased with yourself, Susie  Stutzman. I'll bet you clapped and hollered like that on purpose,  just to scare away my subjects. Didn't you?"  <p>     Susie nodded slowly.  <p>     "Why?"  <p>     "Because your <i>mamm</i> has been looking for you, and your  mamm and my mamm need our help baking pies for Sunday  after church at my folks' house."  <p>     Melinda groaned and flopped down on the log.  <p>     Susie pursed her lips. "I also knew that if I just whispered  in your ear that you were needed in the kitchen, the deer would  have stayed put, and you'd have kept right on drawing."  <p>     Melinda pushed a wayward strand of golden blond hair away  from her face and tucked it into the bun she wore at the back of  her head. "How did you know where to find me, anyway?"  <p>     Susie wrinkled her nose. "You're kidding, right?"  <p>     Melinda shrugged. Her gaze traveled around the wooded  area, and she said, "Just listen to the music of the birds. Isn't it  the most beautiful sound you've ever heard?"  <p>     "It's nice, but there's other-"  <p>     "Do you smell that fresh pine scent from all the trees?"  <p>     Susie nodded and drew in a deep breath as the woodsy aroma  filled her nostrils. "It does smell nice in the woods," she admitted.  <p>     "It's so peaceful here, don't you think?"  <p>     "Jah, but there are other things I'd rather do than sit in the  woods for hours on end." Susie took a seat on the log beside  Melinda. "What draws you to these woods, anyway?"  <p>     "The animals that live here, of course. Every creature God  created is special, but the ones that live in the woods fascinate  me more than any others."  <p>     "There's a big difference between <i>fascinated</i> and <i>fanatical</i>."  <p>     Melinda snickered. "Fanatical, is it? Since when did you start  using such fancy words?"  <p>     Susie shrugged. "I've been reading a novel about a young  woman who likes to solve mysteries. Her mother accuses her of  being fanatical."  <p>     "You'd better not start shirking your duties because you're  reading too much, or your mamm will become <i>fanatical</i>."  <p>     "Who's going to tell her-you?"  <p>     "Of course not. You know I'm not one to blab anyone's  secret."  <p>     "No, but you sure do like to change the subject."  <p>     "What subject was that?"  <p>     "The one about animals and your love for them. Ever since  you were little, you've been playing nursemaid to any stray animal  that came near your place." Susie shook her head. "I just don't  understand it."  <p>     "Do you think me wanting to care for animals is a bad thing?"  <p>     "I suppose not, unless it's all you think about." Susie turned  her head sharply, and a wisp of hair slipped out from under her  kapp and fell onto her cheek.  <p>     Melinda pointed to Susie's hair. "I thought it was only me  who didn't get her bun put up right."  <p>     Susie snickered. "I guess that's one thing we still have in  common."  <p>     "What do you mean? There are lots of things we both like."  <p>     Susie elbowed Melinda gently in the ribs. "Jah-lemon sponge  cakes, barbecued beef, and Aaron Zook's new puppy, Rufus."  <p>     "I'm wondering if it's Aaron you're interested in and not  his dog."  <p>     Susie's elbow connected with Melinda's ribs a second time.  "You're such a kidder."  <p>     "I wasn't kidding."  <p>     "Aaron's more like a <i>bruder</i> to me than anything."  <p>     "He's like a brother to me, too. His mamm and my mamm  have been friends a long time. Her <i>kinner</i>, Isaiah, and I have  grown up together, so I could never see Aaron as more than a  brother." Melinda scanned the woods again. "I wish those deer  would come back so I could finish sketching their picture."  <p>     Susie stared at a noisy crow circling overhead. "You and Gabe  Swartz have been courting several months now, right?"  <p>     "That's true."  <p>     "Do you think you'll end up marrying him?"  <p>     "That all depends."  <p>     "On what?"  <p>     "On whether he asks, and whether I decide to-" Melinda  halted her words then slipped her drawing tablet and pencil into  the canvas tote at her feet. She jumped up and grabbed Susie's  hand. "We'd better go. It wouldn't be good to keep our mamms  waiting any longer, you know."  <p>                             * * *  <p>  Gabe whistled as he swiped a piece of sandpaper across the door  of a new kitchen cabinet. He was alone at the shop today. His dad  had gone to Seymour to pick up some supplies he had ordered.  Gabe figured it might be some time before Pap returned, because  when he went to town he usually headed straight for the fast-food  restaurant and bought a juicy cheeseburger and an order of  fries. And he'd often drop by Lazy Lee's Gas Station and chew  the fat with whoever was working that day.  <p>     Gabe smiled. He liked being alone in the shop. It gave him  a chance to try his hand at making a few new things without his  dad holding him back or scrutinizing every little detail.  <p>     <i>When I'm done with this door, I think I'll start making that  birdhouse I plan to give Melinda for her birthday next month. She's  always feeding the birds and taking care of any that get hurt, so I'm sure  she'd like to have another birdhouse-maybe a feeder, too.</i> He rubbed  his chin thoughtfully. <i>Maybe I should make a birdhouse with a  feeding station attached. I'll bet she'd like that.</i>  <p>     A vision of Melinda's pretty face popped into Gabe's mind.  Her golden blond hair and clear blue eyes were enough to turn  any man's head. He had been interested in her since they were  both children. But it wasn't just Melinda's pretty face that had  made him fall in love with her. It was Melinda's spunky attitude  and zest for living he found so appealing. She had always been  adventurous, wanting to explore new things and eager to learn all  she could about birds and animals. Gabe still remembered how  nervous he had felt months ago when he'd asked her stepfather  for permission to court her.  <p>     The cowbell hanging by a rope on the front door jangled,  and Gabe looked up, his musings halted.  <p>     Melinda's stepfather, Noah Hertzler, entered the room. "<i>Wie  geht's?</i> How's business?"  <p>     "I'm doing well, and so is the business. How's your job at the  Christmas tree farm?"  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><br> Excerpted from <b>Dear to Me</b> by <b>Wanda E.
