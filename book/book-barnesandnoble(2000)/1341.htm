With crystalline intensity and precision, Otsuka uses a single family to evoke the deracination&#8212;both physical and emotional&#8212;of a generation of Japanese Americans. In five chapters, each flawlessly executed from a different point of view&#8212;the mother receiving the order to evacuate; the daughter on the long train ride to the camp; the son in the desert encampment; the family&#8217;s return to their home; and the bitter release of the father after more than four years in captivity&#8212;she has created a small tour de force, a novel of unrelenting economy and suppressed emotion. Spare, intimate, arrestingly understated, <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> is a haunting evocation of a family in wartime and an unmistakably resonant lesson for our times. It heralds the arrival of a singularly gifted new novelist.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>
</p><h3>Annotation</h3><p><strong>Second-place winner, 2002 Barnes & Noble <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/awards/index_cds2.asp?PID=1527">Discover Great New Writers Award</a>, Fiction.</strong></p><h3>The New Yorker</h3><p>This exceptional first novel is about a Japanese family in Berkeley, California, during the Second World War. After the father is arrested for treason, the mother, daughter, and son are sent to an internment camp, where the girl tells her brother bedtime stories about the desert beyond the barbed-wire fence, and the boy whispers the forbidden name of the Japanese emperor when he thinks no one is listening. Otsuka skillfully dramatizes a world suddenly foreign, from the "No Japs Allowed" sign at the movie theatre to the horse meat served at dinner in the camp. The implicit questions about culpability resonate with particular power right now, but Otsuka's incantatory, unsentimental prose is the book's greatest strength. It turns our ideas of beauty on their head, as when the boy uneasily remembers a treasured glimpse of the horses he now eats: "They had long black tails and dark flowing manes and he had watched them galloping in the moonlight across the flat dusty plain and then for three nights in a row he had dreamed of them."</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>Former artist Julie Otsuka's talent took a literary turn when she put down her brushes and picked up a pen to write her stunning debut novel, <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</I>.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><h3>Customer Reviews</h3><ul class="reviewBox"><li class="first">Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget " id="9780385721813_BK"><span class="avg-4h section_updateRating"></span></span></li><li>Ratings: 18<span id="numReviews">Reviews: 13</span></li><li><a name="seeAllReviewsContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-All-Reviews">See All Reviews</a></li><li><p class="writeReview"><strong><a name="writeReview_OverviewTab" class="section_writeReview" rel="nofollow" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-Write-A-Review" href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/WriteReview.aspx?EAN=9780385721813"></a></strong></p></li></ul><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Learn about the Japanese experience during WWII<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1301286_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780385721813_BK_24_1301286" href="#previewReview_1301286" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>February 06, 2010:

I have a favorite seat, way in back in the corner, and I've been sitting there for years. Writing is an extremely lonely pursuit, and there's something comforting about being out in a public place, surrounded by people you know and see every day -- the waitresses, the other regulars who are also working on books or screenplays or musical scores of their own. Everyone's in there just making stuff up. And eating pastry, too, of course." <p>    <b>"I had no idea when I started writing</b> �Evacuation Order No. 19' -- the first chapter of my novel -- that it would turn into something larger. I'd never written anything serious before, only comic fiction, and had never intended to take on the subject of the war. But the character of the woman in the story simply took up residence, one day, in my head: I saw her standing alone on a street, reading the evacuation notice for the first time, and then I followed her home to see who she was, and what she might do after that." <p>    <b>"I came to New York to be a painter</b>, and failed. My background in the visual arts, however, has definitely influenced the way I work -- the process of painting is not all that different from that of writing. You wake up, go to your studio or your desk, you sketch out a scene, it's all wrong, you make it a little warmer, a little cooler, it's still wrong.... Because I'd failed as a painter, I felt that I had nothing to lose when I began writing, which made it easier, somehow."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2004, we asked authors featured in Meet the Writers to give us a list of their all-time favorite summer reads, and tell us what makes them just right for the season.

I remember thinking, 'oh, so <I>that's</I> how you do it.' Now I'm much less convinced, however, that there's a right way to do it. Still, he was the writer I first imprinted myself on, and I go back to his stories often, if only for the pleasure of listening to the sound of his sentences, his cadences.<p>    <b>What are your favorite books -- and why?</b><br>  Oh, difficult, but a few favorites include:  <ul><p>  <li><I>The Plague</I>, by Albert Camus -- for its humanity, and for the narrator's deep affection for his characters <p>  <li><I>The Fire Next Time</I>, by James Baldwin -- for his fierce passion, and his gorgeous lyrical voice <p>  <li><I>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</I>, by Joan Didion -- because she's really <I>looking</I>, and because she makes thinking so sexy <p>  <li><I>The Lover</I>, by Marguerite Duras -- for showing me another way it could be done<p>  <li><I>Badenheim, 1939</I>, by Aharon Appelfeld -- for so perfectly (and quietly) describing the "moment before" <p>  </ul> <p>    Also, some short story collections I could not do without:   <ul><p>  <li><I>Rock Springs</I>, by Richard Ford -- for the way  he writes about love, and for showing me what a story could be <p>  <li><I>Dusk</I>, by James Salter -- for the utter perfection of his sentences<p>  <li><I>The Things They Carried</I>, by Tim O'Brien -- for making it realer than real<p>  <li><I>The Collected Stories</I>, by Franz Kafka -- for imagining it all before it happened <p>  </ul><p>    <b>Favorite films?</b><br>  <li><I>Afterlife</I>, by the Japanese filmmaker, Kore-eda  <li><I>Apocalypse Now</I>  <li><I>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</I>  <li><I>The Graduate</I>  <li><I>Persona</I>  <li><I>Badlands</I>  <li><I>Breathless</I>  <li><I>Woman in the Dunes</I>  <li><I>Hiroshima, Mon Amour</I>  <li><I>Jules and Jim</I>  <li><I>The Wizard of Oz</I>  </ul><p>    <b>Favorite music?</b>  <li>Bach Mass in B Minor  <li>Mozart Requiem  <li>Marvin Gaye  <li>Janis Joplin  <li>Neil Young  <li>Steve Reich  <li>Gregorian chants  <li>Nina Simone  <li>Jeff Buckley  </ul><p>    <b>What are your favorite books to give as gifts?</b><br>  My favorite book to give is Julie Hecht's <I>Do The Windows Open?</i> If I could be reincarnated as a comic writer, I'd come back as her.<p>  <b>Who are your favorite writers, and what makes their writing special?</b><br>  I am a huge fan of Jamaica Kincaid's -- her prose is utterly hypnotic and rhythmically perfect, her sentences sing. And beneath the language, such outrage, such heartbreak. I also always look forward to the latest story by Alice Munro or Richard Ford, two of the short story masters, in my opinion. And anything by Joy Williams. Rick Bass. Steven Millhauser. Lydia Davis. Also, Haruki Murakami.

The story unfolds in the third person as four family members move through the different phases of their internment.  Otsuka's language is spare, and her images are intense.  The mother dispenses with the remnants of the family's life in California when they are forced out of their home.  The boy recalls his father's arrest -- how he was led out of the house in a bathrobe and slippers.  On a train headed for the Nevada desert, the children reflect on how their lives have changed, with their comfortable home giving way to whitewashed horse stalls, and finally to a dusty wasteland in the middle of nowhere.<p> 

Their father imprisoned in far away New Mexico, the children and their mother eke out a new existence in the "blinding white glare" of the treeless desert internment camp.  Assigned to a single room in a tar-paper barracks with three iron cots, they live through brutally hot summers and bitterly cold winters as their once happy and promising lives waste away, and as they wait, patiently, for the war to end.  
(<i>Fall 2002 Selection</i>)</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>Julie Otsuka&#8217;s commanding debut novel paints a portrait of the Japanese internment camps unlike any we have ever seen. With crystalline intensity and precision, Otsuka uses a single family to evoke the deracination&#8212;both physical and emotional&#8212;of a generation of Japanese Americans. In five chapters, each flawlessly executed from a different point of view&#8212;the mother receiving the order to evacuate; the daughter on the long train ride to the camp; the son in the desert encampment; the family&#8217;s return to their home; and the bitter release of the father after more than four years in captivity&#8212;she has created a small tour de force, a novel of unrelenting economy and suppressed emotion. Spare, intimate, arrestingly understated, <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> is a haunting evocation of a family in wartime and an unmistakably resonant lesson for our times. It heralds the arrival of a singularly gifted new novelist.<br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>
</p><h3>The New Yorker</h3><p>This exceptional first novel is about a Japanese family in Berkeley, California, during the Second World War. After the father is arrested for treason, the mother, daughter, and son are sent to an internment camp, where the girl tells her brother bedtime stories about the desert beyond the barbed-wire fence, and the boy whispers the forbidden name of the Japanese emperor when he thinks no one is listening. Otsuka skillfully dramatizes a world suddenly foreign, from the "No Japs Allowed" sign at the movie theatre to the horse meat served at dinner in the camp. The implicit questions about culpability resonate with particular power right now, but Otsuka's incantatory, unsentimental prose is the book's greatest strength. It turns our ideas of beauty on their head, as when the boy uneasily remembers a treasured glimpse of the horses he now eats: "They had long black tails and dark flowing manes and he had watched them galloping in the moonlight across the flat dusty plain and then for three nights in a row he had dreamed of them."</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>This heartbreaking, bracingly unsentimental debut describes in  poetic detail the travails of a Japanese family living in an  internment camp during World War II, raising the specter of  wartime injustice in bone-chilling fashion. After a woman whose  husband was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy sees notices  posted around her neighborhood in Berkeley instructing Japanese  residents to evacuate, she moves with her son and daughter to an  internment camp, abruptly severing her ties with her community.  The next three years are spent in filthy, cramped and impersonal  lodgings as the family is shuttled from one camp to another.  They return to Berkeley after the war to a home that has been  ravaged by vandals; it takes time for them to adjust to life  outside the camps and to come to terms with the hostility they  face. When the children's father re-enters the book, he is more  of a symbol than a character, reduced to a husk by interrogation  and abuse. The novel never strays into melodrama-Otsuka  describes the family's everyday life in Berkeley and the pitiful  objects that define their world in the camp with admirable  restraint and modesty. Events are viewed from numerous  characters' points of view, and the different perspectives are  defined by distinctive, lyrically simple observations. The  novel's honesty and matter-of-fact tone in the face of  inconceivable injustice are the source of its power. Anger only  comes to the fore during the last segment, when the father is  allowed to tell his story-but even here, Otsuka keeps rage  neatly bound up, luminous beneath the dazzling surface of her  novel. (Sept.)  Forecast: Reader interest in the Japanese-American experience  was proved by the success of Snow Falling on Cedars. Otsuka's  pared-down narrative may have a more limited appeal, but can  safely be recommended to Guterson fans. Five-city author tour.   Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.
</p><h3>VOYA</h3><p>Their middle-class, close-knit Japanese American family could have been any of the thousands uprooted from their homes in the Pacific coast and sent to internment camps in distant states during World War II "for the sake of national security" and "for their own protection." Otsuka eloquently chronicles in five chapters, one from each family member, their reactions as they are removed from their friendly neighborhoods and thrust into a strange new world where they are now the enemy. Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the father, still in bathrobe and slippers, is taken away by the FBI for questioning and is not allowed to return home. Later, the mother, her eleven-year-old daughter, and her eight-year-old son are told to prepare to leave, taking with them only what they can carry. Resettled in a Utah camp, they begin to receive heavily censored letters from the father, who is now detained in New Mexico. When the war ends, they are sent home, impoverished and viewed with suspicion by their old neighbors. Resilient and resolute, the mother begins to earn a living as a maid, coping with her physically weakened, spiritually crushed husband. The family is nameless, adding to the feelings of unreality and alienation. With precise detail, succinct but sensitive prose, and great emotional restraint, Otsuka's enlightening, deeply stirring, Alex Award-winning book will affect all readers.

								Alan Review</h3><p>A compelling and heartbreaking story, this book is about the tragedy of Japanese Americans interned during WW II and, by understated implication, it is a powerful indictment of the kind of racism still practiced in this country, now more commonly directed at Middle Easterners. First, the father is taken for "routine questioning," not to be seen by his family for over four years. A few months later, mother, teen daughter, and ten-year-old son are sent to a fenced and guarded desert camp for three and half years. Haunting, evocative, brilliantly written, with multiple points of view�mother, daughter, son, daughter and son ("we"), and finally, father, none of whom is given a name�this novel merits significant attention. Note: some young readers may benefit from teacher or Web explanations of the internment camps of WW II, and the treatment of Japanese Americans before, during, and especially, after their imprisonment. 2002, Knopf, 144 pp.,</p><h3>Courtney Lewis

								KLIATT</h3><p>Otsuka has created an intriguing story about Japanese internment during WW II. This powerful book is characterized by sparse, contained prose detailing the lives of a Japanese American family in California. The reader never learns the names of the characters, just their roles in their family-mother, son, daughter, and later, father. As the mother walks around her neighborhood on her errands, she stops to read a notice and her demeanor changes. She begins packing, locking up some items and burying others. She gives away the cat and kills the dog prior to her children coming home from school. They take a train out to the desert and are interned in a concentration camp, all the while awaiting news from the father who was taken away one night in his bathrobe and slippers. Through the minute details of their lives and their memories of what life was like before the war, we get to know each character and their personalities. The father, reduced in most of the story to the author of an occasional postcard, finally rejoins his family as a shell of his former self, reduced to a fearful life of mere existence. The other members of the family, once returned home after the war, cannot look at their neighbors or even their home the same way. Each has invisible but lasting scars from their experience. <I>When the Emperor Was Divine</I> could easily be categorized as psychological fiction as well as historical fiction with its in-depth look at the minds of its characters and how each of them copes with their situation. There is no reader's guide to the book, which would have increased its appeal, as the paperback version will undoubtedly inspire book clubs to adopt it as a selection. Senior high andpublic libraries will definitely want to add this work if they don't already own the hardcover edition. KLIATT Codes: SA-Recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2002, Random House, Anchor, 144p., Ages 15 to adult.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Otsuka researched historical sources and her own grandparents'  experiences as background for this spare yet poignant first  novel about the ordeal of a Japanese family sent to an  internment camp during World War II. Its perspective shifts  among different family members as the story unfolds. We see the  mother numbly pack up the family's middle-class belongings to  leave behind in their Berkeley home. The dehumanizing train trip  to the camp, and the bleak internment in the alkaline Nevada  desert, as related by the young son and daughter, become mythic  events. Their father, picked up for questioning immediately  after Pearl Harbor and imprisoned throughout the war, returns a  broken and bitter man. The family's humiliation continues beyond  the war's end: after returning to their vandalized home, they  are shunned for months by former friends and neighbors. The  novel's themes of freedom and banishment are especially  important as we see civil liberties threatened during the  current war on terrorism. Otsuka's clear, elegant prose makes  these themes accessible to a range of reading levels from young  adult on. Highly recommended for all libraries.-Reba Leiding,  James Madison Univ.

</p><h3>New York Times</h3><p>Crystalline.... precise but poetic.... resonant and beautifully nuanced.... &#151;Michiko Kakutani</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A carefully researched little novel, Otsuka's first, about the US internment of Japanese citizens during WWII that's perfect down to the tiniest detail but doesn't stir the heart. Shortly after the war begins, the father of an unnamed Japanese family of four in Berkeley, California, is taken from his home-not even given time to dress-and held for questioning. His wife and two children won't see him until after war's end four years later, when he'll have been transformed into a suddenly very old man, afraid, broken, and unwilling to speak even a word about what happened to him. Meanwhile, from the spring of 1942 until the autumn after the armistice, the mother, age 42, with her son and daughter of 8 and 11, respectively, will be held in camps in high-desert Utah, treeless and windswept, where they'll live in rows of wooden barracks offering little privacy, few amenities, and causing them to suffer-the mother especially-greater and greater difficulty in hanging on to any sense of hope or normality. The characters are denied even first names, perhaps as a way of giving them universality, but the device does nothing to counteract the reader's ongoing difficulty in entering into them. Details abound-book titles, contemporary references (the Dionne quints, sugar rationing), keepsakes the children take to the camp (a watch, a blue stone), euthanizing the family dog the night before leaving for the camps-but still the narrative remains stubbornly at the surface, almost like an informational flow, causing the reader duly to acknowledge these many wrongs done to this unjustly uprooted and now appallingly deprived American family-but never finding a way to go deeper, to a place where the attentionwill be held rigid and the heart seized. Earnestly done, and correctly, but information trumps drama, and the heart is left out. First printing of 40,000

It is Berkeley, California, the spring of 1942. Pearl Harbor has been attacked, the war is on, and though the precise message on the sign is not revealed, its impact on the woman who reads it is immediate and profound. It is, in many ways she cannot yet foresee, a sign of things to come. She readies herself and her two young children for a journey that will take them to the high desert plains of Utah and into a world that will shatter their illusions forever. They travel by train and gradually the reader discovers that all on board are Japanese American, that the shades must be pulled down at night so as not to invite rock-throwing, and that their destination is an internment camp where they will be imprisoned &#8220;for their own safety&#8221; until the war is over. With stark clarity and an unflinching gaze, Otsuka explores the inner lives of her main characters&#8211;the mother, daughter, and son&#8211;as they struggle to understand their fate and long for the father who they have not seen since he was whisked away, in slippers and handcuffs, on the evening of Pearl Harbor.<br><br>Moving between dreams, memories, and sharply emblematic moments, <b>When the Emperor Was Divine</b> reveals the dark underside of a moment inAmerican history that, until now, has been left largely unexplored in American fiction. <b><br></b> <p>1. <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> gives readers an intimate view of the fate of Japanese Americans during World War II. In what ways does the novel deepen our existing knowledge of this historical period? What does it give readers that a straightforward historical investigation cannot? </p><p>2. Why does Otsuka choose to reveal the family's reason for moving&#8211;and the father's arrest&#8211;so indirectly and so gradually? What is the effect when the reason becomes apparent?</p><p>3. Otsuka skillfully places subtle but significant details in her narrative. When the mother goes to Lundy's hardware store, she notices a &#8220;dark stain&#8221; on the register &#8220;that would not go away.&#8221; The dog she has to kill is called &#8220;White Dog.&#8221; Her daughter's favorite song on the radio is &#8220;Don't Fence Me In.&#8221; How do these details, and others like them, point to larger meanings in the novel?</p><p>4. Why does Otsuka refer to her characters as &#8220;the woman,&#8221; &#8220;the girl,&#8221; &#8220;the boy,&#8221; and &#8220;the father,&#8221; rather than giving them names? How does this lack of specific identities affect the reader's relationship to the characters?</p><p>5. When they arrive at the camp in the Utah desert&#8211;&#8220;a city of tar-paper barracks behind a barbed-wire fence on a dusty alkaline plain&#8221;&#8211;the boy thinks he sees his father everywhere: &#8220;wherever the boy looked he saw him: Daddy, Papa, <i>Oto-san.&#8221;</i> Why is the father's absence such a powerful presence in the novel? How do the mother and daughter think of him? How would their story have been different had the family remained together? <b><br></b></p><p>6. When the boy wonders why he's in the camp, he worries that &#8220;he'd done something horribly, terribly wrong. . . . It could be anything. Something he'd done yesterday&#8211;chewing the eraser off his sister's pencil before putting it back in the pencil jar&#8211;or something he'd done a long time ago that was just now catching up with him.&#8221; What does this passage reveal about the damage racism does to children? What does it reveal about the way children try to make sense of their experience?</p><p>7. In the camp, the prisoners are told they've been brought there for their &#8220;own protection,&#8221; and that &#8220;it was all in the interest of national security. It was a matter of military necessity. It was an opportunity for them to prove their loyalty.&#8221; Why, and in what ways, are these justifications problematic? What do they reveal about the attitude of the American government toward Japanese Americans? How would these justifications appear to those who were taken from their homes and placed behind fences for the duration of the war? <b><br></b></p><p>8. What parallels does the novel reveal between the American treatment of citizens of Japanese descent and the Nazi treatment of Jews?</p><p>9. Much of <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> is told in short, episodic, loosely connected scenes&#8211;images, conversations, memories, dreams, and so on&#8211;that move between past and present and alternate points of view between the mother, daughter, and son. Why has Otsuka chosen to structure her narrative in this way? What effects does it allow her to achieve? <b><br></b></p><p>10. After the family is released from the camp, what instructions are they given? How do they regard themselves? How does America regard them? In what ways have they been damaged by their internment?</p><p>11. When they are at last reunited with their father, the family doesn't know how to react. &#8220;Because the man who stood there before us was not our father. He was somebody else, a stranger who had been sent back in our father's place.&#8221; Why do they regard him as a stranger? How has be been changed by his experience? In what ways does this reunion underscore the tragedy of America's decision to imprison Japanese Americans during the war?</p><p>12. After the father returns home, he never once discusses the years he'd been away, and his children don't ask. &#8220;We didn't want to know. . . . All we wanted to do, now that we were back in the world, was forget.&#8221; Why do the children feel this way? Why would their father remain silent about such an important experience? In what ways does the novel fight against this desire to forget?</p><p>13. The mother is denied work because being a Japanese American might &#8220;upset the other employees&#8221; or offend the customers. She turns down a job working in a dark back room of a department store because she is afraid she &#8220;might accidentally remember who I was and. . . . offend <i>myself</i>.&#8221; What does this statement reveal about her character? What strengths does she exhibit throughout her ordeal?</p><p>14. Flowers appear throughout the novel. When one of the prisoners is shot by a guard, a witness believes the man had been reaching through the fence to pluck a flower. And the penultimate chapter ends with the following sentence: &#8220;But we never stopped believing that somewhere out there, in some stranger's backyard, our mother's rosebush was blossoming madly, wildly, pressing one perfect red flower after another out into the late afternoon light.&#8221; What symbolic value do the flowers have in this final passage? What does this open-ended ending suggest about the relationship between the family and the &#8220;strangers&#8221; they live amongst? <b><br></b></p><p>15. <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> concludes with a confession. Who is speaking in this final chapter? Is the speech entirely ironic? Why has Otsuka chosen to end the novel in this way? What does the confession imply about our ability to separate out the &#8220;enemy,&#8221; the &#8220;other,&#8221; in our midst? <b><br></b></p>

EVACUATION ORDER NO. 19<p>
The sign had appeared overnight. On billboards
and trees and the backs of the bus-stop benches.
It hung in the window of Woolworth's. It hung
by the entrance to the YMCA. It was stapled to the door
of the municipal court and nailed, at eye level, to every
telephone pole along University Avenue. The woman
was returning a book to the library when she saw the
sign in a post office window. It was a sunny day in
Berkeley in the spring of 1942 and she was wearing new
glasses and could see everything clearly for the first time
in weeks. She no longer had to squint but she squinted
out of habit anyway. She read the sign from top to bottom
and then, still squinting, she took out a pen and read
the sign from top to bottom again. The print was small
and dark. Some of it was tiny. She wrote down a few
words on the back of a bank receipt, then turned around
and went home and began to pack.<p>
When the overdue notice from the library arrived in
the mail nine days later she still had not finished packing.<p>
The children had just left for school and boxes and
suitcases were scattered across the floor of the house.
She tossed the envelope into the nearest suitcase and
walked out the door.<p>
Outside the sun was warm and the palm fronds were
clacking idly against the side of the house. She pulled on
her white silk gloves and began to walk east on Ashby.
She crossed California Street and bought several bars of
Lux soap and a large jar of face cream at the Rumford
Pharmacy. She passed the thrift shop and the boardedup
grocery but saw no one she knew on the sidewalk.<p>
At the newsstand on the corner of Grove she bought a
copy of the <i>Berkeley Gazette</i>. She scanned the headlines
quickly. The Burma Road had been severed and one of
the Dionne quintuplets -- Yvonne -- was still recovering
from an ear operation. Sugar rationing would begin on
Tuesday. She folded the paper in half but was careful not
to let the ink darken her gloves.<p>
At Lundy's Hardware she stopped and looked at the
display of victory garden shovels in the window. They
were well-made shovels with sturdy metal handles and
she thought, for a moment, of buying one -- the price
was right and she did not like to pass up a bargain. Then
she remembered that she already had a shovel at home
in the shed. In fact, she had two. She did not need a
third. She smoothed down her dress and went into the
store.<p>
"Nice glasses," Joe Lundy said the moment she
walked through the door.<p>
"You think?" she asked. "I'm not used to them yet."<p>
She picked up a hammer and gripped the handle firmly.
"Do you have anything bigger?" she asked. Joe Lundy
said that what she had in her hand was the biggest hammer
he had. She put the hammer back on the rack.<p>
"How's your roof holding out?" he asked her.<p>
"I think the shingles are rotting. It just sprung
another leak."<p>
"It's been a wet year."<p>
The woman nodded. "But we've had some nice days."<p>
She walked past the venetian blinds and the blackout
shades to the back of the store. She picked out two
rolls of tape and a ball of twine and brought them back
to the register. "Every time it rains I have to set out
the bucket," she said. She put down two quarters on the
counter.<p>
"Nothing wrong with a bucket," said Joe Lundy. He
pushed the quarters back toward her across the counter
but he did not look at her. "You can pay me later," he
said. Then he began to wipe the side of the register with
a rag. There was a dark stain there that would not go
away.<p>
"I can pay you now," said the woman.<p>
"Don't worry about it," said Joe Lundy. He reached
into his shirt pocket and gave her two caramel candies
wrapped in gold foil. "For the children," he said. She
slipped the caramels into her purse but left the money.
She thanked him for the candy and walked out of the
store.<p>
"That's a nice red dress," he called out after her.<p>
She turned around and squinted at him over the top
of her glasses. "Thank you," she said. "Thank you, Joe."
Then the door slammed behind her and she was alone
on the sidewalk and she realized that in all the years she
had been going to Joe Lundy's store she had never
before called him by his name. Joe. It sounded strange
to her. Wrong, almost. But she had said it. She had said
it out loud. She wished she had said it earlier.<p>
She wiped her forehead with her handkerchief. The
sun was bright and she did not like to sweat in public.
She took off her glasses and crossed to the shady side
of the street. At the corner of Shattuck she took the
streetcar downtown. She got off at Kittredge and went
into J.&nbsp;F. Hink's department store and asked the salesman
if they had any duffel bags but they did not, they
were all sold out. He had sold the last one a half-hour
ago. He suggested she try J.&nbsp;C. Penney's but they were
sold out of duffel bags there too. They were sold out of
duffel bags all over town.<p>

When she got home  the woman took off her red
dress and put on her faded blue one -- her housedress.
She twisted her hair up into a bun and put on an old pair
of comfortable shoes. She had to finish packing. She
rolled up the Oriental rug in the living room. She took
down the mirrors. She took down the curtains and
shades. She carried the tiny bonsai tree out into the yard
and set it down on the grass beneath the eaves where it
would not get too much shade or too much sun but just
the right amount of each. She brought the wind-up Victrola
and the Westminster chime clock downstairs to the
basement.<p>
Upstairs, in the boy's room, she unpinned the One
World One War map of the world from the wall and
folded it neatly along the crease lines. She wrapped up
his stamp collection and the painted wooden Indian
with the long headdress he had won at the Sacramento
State Fair. She pulled out the Joe Palooka comic books
from under his bed. She emptied the drawers. Some of
his clothes -- the clothes he would need -- she left out for
him to put into his suitcase later. She placed his baseball
glove on his pillow. The rest of his things she put into
boxes and carried into the sunroom.<p>
The door to the girl's room was closed. Above the
doorknob was a note that had not been there the day
before. It said DO NOT DISTURB. The woman did not
open the door. She went down the stairs and removed
the pictures from the walls. There were only three: the
painting of Princess Elizabeth that hung in the dining
room, the picture of Jesus in the foyer, and in the
kitchen, a framed reproduction of Millet's <i>The Gleaners</i>.
She placed Jesus and the little Princess together facedown
in a box. She made sure to put Jesus on top. She
took <i>The Gleaners</i> out of its frame and looked at the picture
one last time. She wondered why she had let it hang
in the kitchen for so long. It bothered her, the way those
peasants were forever bent over above that endless field
of wheat. "Look up" she wanted to say to them. "Look
up, look up!" <i>The Gleaners,</i> she decided, would have to
go. She set the picture outside with the garbage.<p>
In the living room she emptied all the books from
the shelves except Audubon's <i>Birds of America</i>. In the
kitchen she emptied the cupboards. She set aside a few
things for later that evening. Everything else -- the
china, the crystal, the set of ivory chopsticks her mother
had sent to her fifteen years ago from Kagoshima on her
wedding day -- she put into boxes. She taped the boxes
shut with the tape she had bought from Lundy's Hardware
and carried them one by one up the stairs to the
sunroom. When she was done she locked the door with
two padlocks and sat down on the landing with her
dress pushed up above her knees and lit a cigarette.
Tomorrow she and the children would be leaving. She
did not know where they were going or how long they
would be gone or who would be living in their house
while they were away. She knew only that tomorrow
they had to go.<p>
There were things they could take with them: bedding
and linen, forks, spoons, plates, bowls, cups, clothes.
These were the words she had written down on the back
of the bank receipt. Pets were not allowed. That was
what the sign had said.<p>
It was late April. It was the fourth week of the fifth
month of the war and the woman, who did not always
follow the rules, followed the rules. She gave the cat
to the Greers next door. She caught the chicken that
had been running wild in the yard since the fall and
snapped its neck beneath the handle of a broomstick.
She plucked out the feathers and set the carcass into a
pan of cold water in the sink.<p>

By early afternoon her handkerchief was soaked.<p>
She was breathing hard and her nose was itching from
the dust. Her back ached. She slipped off her shoes
and massaged the bunions on her feet, then went into
the kitchen and turned on the radio. Enrico Caruso
was singing "La donna � mobile" again. His voice was
full and sweet. She opened the icebox and took out a
plate of rice balls stuffed with pickled plums. She ate
them slowly as she listened to the tenor sing. The plums
were dark and sour. They were just the way she liked
them.<p>
When the aria was over she turned off the radio and
put two rice balls into a blue bowl. She cracked an egg
over the bowl and added some salmon she had cooked
the night before. She brought the bowl outside to the
back porch and set it down on the steps. Her back was
throbbing but she stood up straight and clapped her
hands three times.<p>
A small white dog came limping out of the trees.<p>
"Eat up, White Dog," she said. White Dog was old
and ailing but he knew how to eat. His head bobbed up
and down above the bowl. The woman sat down beside
him and watched. When the bowl was empty he looked
up at her. One of his eyes was clouded over. She rubbed
his stomach and his tail thumped against the wooden
steps.<p>
"Good dog," she said.<p>
She stood up and walked across the yard and White
Dog followed her. The narcissus in the garden were
white with mildew and the irises were beginning to wilt.
Weeds were everywhere. The woman had not mowed
the grass for months. Her husband usually did that. She
had not seen her husband since his arrest last December.
First he had been sent to Fort Missoula, Montana, on a
train and then he had been transferred to Fort Sam
Houston, Texas. Every few days he was allowed to
write her a letter. Usually he told her about the weather.
The weather at Fort Sam Houston was fine. On the back
of every envelope was stamped "Censored, War Department,"
or "Detained Alien Enemy Mail."<p>
The woman sat down on a rock beneath the persimmon
tree. White Dog lay at her feet and closed his eyes.
"White Dog," she said, "look at me." White Dog raised
his head. The woman was his mistress and he did whatever
she asked. She put on her white silk gloves and
took out a roll of twine. "Now just keep looking at me,"
she said. She tied White Dog to the tree. "You've been a
good dog," she said. "You've been a good white dog."
Somewhere in the distance a telephone rang. White
Dog barked. "Hush," she said. White Dog grew quiet.
"Now roll over," she said. White Dog rolled over and
looked up at her with his good eye. "Play dead," she
said. White Dog turned his head to the side and closed
his eyes. His paws went limp. The woman picked up the
large shovel that was leaning against the trunk of the
tree. She lifted it high in the air with both hands and
brought the blade down swiftly on his head. White
Dog's body shuddered twice and his hind legs kicked
out into the air, as though he were trying to run. Then he
grew still. A trickle of blood seeped out from the corner
of his mouth. She untied him from the tree and let out a
deep breath. The shovel had been the right choice. Better,
she thought, than a hammer.<p>
Beneath the tree she began to dig a hole. The soil was
hard on top but soft and loamy beneath the surface. It
gave way easily. She plunged the shovel into the earth
again and again until the hole was deep. She picked up
White Dog and dropped him into the hole. His body
was not heavy. It hit the earth with a quiet thud. She
pulled off her gloves and looked at them. They were no
longer white. She dropped them into the hole and
picked up the shovel again. She filled up the hole. The
sun was hot and the only place there was any shade was
beneath the trees. The woman was standing beneath the
trees. She was forty-one and tired. The back of her dress
was drenched with sweat. She brushed her hair out of
her eyes and leaned against the tree. Everything looked
the same except the earth was a little darker where the
hole had been. Darker and wetter. She plucked a leaf
from a low-hanging branch and went back inside the
house.<p>

When the children came home from school she
reminded them that early the next morning they would
be leaving. Tomorrow they were going on a trip. They
could bring with them only what they could carry.
"I already know that," said the girl. She wore a white
cotton frock with tiny blue anchors and her hair was
pulled back in two tight black braids. She tossed her
books onto the sofa and told the woman that her teacher,
Mr. Rutherford, had talked for an entire hour about
prime numbers and coniferous trees.<p>
"Do you know what a coniferous tree is?" the girl
asked.<p>
The woman had to admit that she did not. "Tell me,"
she said, but the girl just shook her head no.<p>
"I'll tell you later," said the girl. She was ten years old
and she knew what she liked. Boys and black licorice
and Dorothy Lamour. Her favorite song on the radio
was "Don't Fence Me In." She adored her pet macaw.
She went to the bookshelf and took down <i>Birds of
America</i>. She balanced the book on her head and walked
slowly, her spine held erect, up the stairs to her room.<p>
A few seconds later there was a loud thump and the
book came tumbling back down the stairs. The boy
looked up at his mother. He was seven and a small black
fedora was tilted to one side of his head. "She has to
stand up straighter," he said softly. He went to the foot
of the stairs and stared at the book. It had landed face
open to a picture of a small brown bird. A marsh wren.<p>
"You have to stand up straighter," he shouted.<p>
"It's not that," came the girl's reply, "it's my head."<p>
"What's wrong with your head?" shouted the boy.<p>
"Too round. Too round on top."<p>
He closed the book and turned to his mother.<p>
"Where's White Dog?" he asked.<p>
He went out to the porch and clapped his hands three
times.<p>
"White Dog!" he yelled. He clapped his hands again.<p>
"White Dog!" He called out several more times, then
went back inside and stood beside the woman in the
kitchen. She was slicing apples. Her fingers were long
and white and they knew how to hold a knife. "That dog
just gets deafer every day," he said.<p>
He sat down and turned the radio on and off, on and
off, while she arranged the apples on a plate. The Radio
City Symphony was performing the last movement of
Tchaikovsky's <i>1812 Overture</i>. Cymbals were crashing.
Cannons boomed. She set the plate down in front of the
boy. "Eat," she said. He reached for a slice of apple
just as the audience burst into applause. "Bravo," they
shouted, "bravo, bravo!" The boy turned the dial to see
if he could find <i>Speaking of Sports</i> but all he could find
was the news and a Sammy Kaye serenade. He turned
off the radio and took another slice of apple from the
plate.<p>
"It's so hot in here," he said.<p>
"Take off your hat then," said the woman but the boy
refused. The hat was a present from his father. It was big
on him but the boy wore it every day. She poured him a
glass of cold barley water and he drank it all in one gulp.<p>
The girl came into the kitchen and went to the
macaw's cage by the stove. She leaned over and put her
face close to the bars. "Tell me something," she said.<p>
The bird fluffed his wings and danced from side to
side on his perch. "Baaaak," he said.<p>
"That's not what I wanted to hear," said the girl.<p>
"Take off your hat," said the bird.<p>
The girl sat down and the woman gave her a glass of
cold barley water and a long silver spoon. The girl licked
the spoon and stared at her reflection. Her head was
upside down. She dipped the spoon into the sugar bowl.<p>
 "Is there anything wrong with my face?" she asked.<p>
"Why?" said the woman.<p>
"People were staring."<p>
"Come over here," said the woman.<p>
The girl stood up and walked over to her mother.<p>
"Let me look at you."<p>
"You took down the mirrors," the girl said.<p>
"I had to. I had to put them away."<p>
"Tell me how I look."<p>
The woman ran her hands across the girl's face. "You
look fine," she said. "You have a fine nose."<p>
"What else?" asked the girl.<p>
"You have a fine set of teeth."<p>
"Teeth don't count."<p>
"Teeth are essential."<p>
The woman began to rub the girl's shoulders. She
told the girl to lean back and close her eyes and then she
pressed her fingers deep into the girl's neck until she felt
her begin to relax. "If there was something wrong with
my face," the girl asked, "would you tell me?"<p>
"Turn around," the woman said.<p>
The girl turned around.<p>
"Now look at me."<p>
The girl looked at her.<p>
"You have the most beautiful face I have ever seen."<p>
"You're just saying that."<p>
"No, I mean it."<p>
The boy turned on the radio. The weatherman was
giving the forecast for the next day. He was predicting
rain and cooler temperatures. "Sit down and drink your
water," the boy said to his sister. "Don't forget to take
your umbrella tomorrow," said the weatherman.<p>
The girl sat down. She drank her barley water and
began to tell the woman all about coniferous trees. Most
of them were evergreens but some were just shrubs. Not
all of them had cones. Some of them, like the yew, only
had seedpods.<p>
"That's good to know," said the woman. Then she
stood up and told the girl it was time to practice the
piano for Thursday's lesson.<p>
"Do I have to?"<p>
The woman thought for a moment. "No," she said,
"only if you want to."<p>
"Tell me I have to."<p>
"I can't."<p>
The girl went out to the living room and sat down
on the piano bench. "The metronome's gone," she called
out.<p>
"Just count to yourself then," said the woman.<p>

" . . . three, five, seven . . . " The girl put
down her knife and paused. They were eating supper at
the table. Outside it was dusk. The sky was dark purple
and a breeze was blowing in off the bay. Hundreds of
jays were twittering madly in the Greers' magnolia tree
next door. A drop of rain fell on the ledge above the
kitchen sink and the woman stood up and closed the
window.<p>
"Eleven, thirteen," said the girl. She was practicing
her prime numbers for Monday's test.<p>
"Sixteen?" said the boy.<p>
"No," said the girl. "Sixteen's got a square root."<p>
"I forgot," said the boy. He picked up a drumstick
and began to eat.<p>
"You never knew," said the girl.<p>
"Forty-one," said the boy. "Eighty-six." He wiped his
mouth with a napkin. "Twelve," he added.<p>
The girl looked at him. Then she turned to her
mother. "There's something wrong with this chicken,"
she said. "It's too tough." She put down her fork. "I can't
swallow another bite."<p>
"Don't, then," said the woman.<p>
"I'll eat it," said the boy. He plucked a wing from his
sister's plate and put it into his mouth. He ate the whole
thing. Then he spit out the bones and asked his mother
where they were going the next day.<p>
"I don't know," the woman said.<p>
The girl stood up and left the table. She sat down at
the piano and began to play a piece by Debussy from
memory. "Golliwogg's Cake Walk." The melody was
slow and simple. She had played it at a recital the summer
before. Her father had sat in the front row of the
audience and when she was finished he had clapped and
clapped. She played the piece all the way through without missing a note. When she began to play it a second
time the boy got up and went to his room and began to
pack.<p>
The first thing he put inside of his suitcase was his
baseball glove. He slipped it into the large pocket with
the red satin lining. The pocket bulged. He threw in his
clothes and tried to close the lid but the suitcase was
very full. He sat on top of it and the lid sank down
slowly. Suddenly he stood up again. The lid sprang
open. There was something he had forgotten. He went
to the closet in the hall and brought back his polkadotted
umbrella. He held it out at arm's length and
shook his head sadly. The umbrella was too long. There
was no way it would fit inside the suitcase.<p>

The woman stood alone in the kitchen, washing
her hands. The children had gone to bed and the
house was quiet. The pipes were still hot from the day
and the water from the faucet was warm. She could hear
thunder in the distance -- thunder and, from somewhere
far off in the night, the faint wail of a siren. She looked
out the window above the sink. The sky was still clear
and she could see a full moon through the branches of
the maple tree. The maple was a sapling with delicate
leaves that turned bright red in the fall. Her husband
had planted it for her four summers ago. She turned off
the tap and looked around for the dish towel but it was
not there. She had already packed the towels. They
were in the suitcase by the door in the hall.<p>
She dried her hands on the front of her dress and
went to the birdcage. She lifted off the green cloth and
undid the wire clasp on the door. "Come on out," she
said. The bird stepped cautiously onto her hand and
looked at her. "It's only me," she said. The bird blinked.
His eyes were black and bulbous. They had no center.<p>
"Get over here," he said, "get over here now." He
sounded just like her husband. If she closed her eyes she
could easily imagine that her husband was right there in
the room with her.<p>
The woman did not close her eyes. She knew exactly
where her husband was. He was sleeping on a cot -- a
cot or maybe a bunk bed -- somewhere in a tent at Fort
Sam Houston where the weather was always fine. She
pictured him lying there with one arm flung across his
eyes and then she kissed the top of the bird's head.<p>
"I am right here," she said. "I am right here, right
now."<p>
She gave the bird a sunflower seed and he cracked
the shell open in his beak. "Get over here," he said again.<p>
She opened the window and set the bird out on the
ledge.<p>
"You're all right," the bird said.<p>
She stroked the underside of his chin and he closed
his eyes. "Silly bird," she whispered. She closed the window and locked it. Now the bird was outside on the
other side of the glass. He tapped the pane three times
with his claw and said something but she did not know
what it was. She could not hear him anymore.<p>
She rapped back.<p>
"Go," she said. The bird flapped his wings and flew
up into the maple tree. She grabbed the broom from
behind the stove and went outside and shook the
branches of the tree. A spray of water fell from the
leaves. "Go," she shouted. "Get on out of here."<p>
The bird spread his wings and flew off into the night.<p>
She went back inside the kitchen and took out a bottle
of plum wine from beneath the sink. Without the bird
in the cage, the house felt empty. She sat down on the
floor and put the bottle to her lips. She swallowed once
and looked at the place on the wall where <i>The Gleaners</i>
had hung. The white rectangle was glowing in the
moonlight. She stood up and traced around its edges
with her finger and began to laugh -- quietly at first, but
soon her shoulders were heaving and she was gasping
for breath. She put down the bottle and waited for
the laughter to stop but it would not, it kept on coming
until finally the tears were running down her cheeks.
She picked up the bottle again and drank. The wine
was dark and sweet. She had made it herself last fall.
She took out her handkerchief and wiped her mouth.
Her lips left a dark stain on the cloth. She put the cork
back into the bottle and pushed it in as far as it would go.<p>
 "La donna � mobile," she sang to herself as she went down
the stairs to the basement. She hid the bottle behind the
old rusted furnace where no one would ever find it.<p>

In the middle of the night the boy crawled into her
bed and asked her, over and over again, "What is that
funny noise? What is that funny noise?"<p>
The woman smoothed down his black hair. "Rain,"
she whispered.<p>
The boy understood. He fell asleep at once. The thunder
had come and gone and except for the sound of the
rain the house was now quiet. The woman lay awake
worrying about the leaky roof. Her husband had meant
to fix it but he never had. She got up and placed a tin
bucket on the floor to catch the water. She felt better
after she did that. She climbed back into bed beside the
boy and pulled the blanket up around his shoulders. He
was chewing in his sleep and she wondered if he was
hungry. Then she remembered the candy in her purse.
The caramels. She had forgotten about the caramels.
What would Joe Lundy say? He would tell her she was
wearing a nice red dress. He would tell her not to worry
about it. She knew that. She closed her eyes. She would
give the caramels to the children in the morning. That
was what she would do. She whispered a silent prayer
to herself and drifted off to sleep as the water dripped
steadily into the bucket. The boy shrugged off the blanket
and rolled up against the wall where it was cool. In a
few hours he and the girl and their mother would wake
up and go to the Civil Control Station at the First Congregational
Church on Channing Way. Then they would
pin their identification numbers to their collars and grab
their suitcases and climb up onto the bus and go to
wherever it was they had to go.
