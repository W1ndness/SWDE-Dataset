They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day, as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large companies. Throughout, the authors asked&#58; "What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?"</p> <p>Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished outstanding companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.</p> <p>Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.</p>
</p><h3>Annotation</h3><p>Fundamentally altering the way the executives think about long-term success, <i>Built to Last</i> has become a bible among CEOs and managers at prestigious corporations the world over.

											Full disclosure: I actually read this after Good to Great (by the same author).  While the books are not one in the same, I did feel as though I may have benefited slightly more by reading this first and Good to Great second.  Either way, these are two must read business books.  A quick summary of Built to Last:<p/><p/>Are you a clock-builder/architect or timekeeper?<p/>Embrace the and, which is the tyranny of the or.<p/>Preserve the core and stimulate progress.<p/>Seek consistent alignment.<p/><p/>Every one of these concepts applies to those look to build their company and succeed in the process.  You will learn a lot about where your company is and what their vision is just by reading this book.  Do they have BHAG's (big, hairy, audacious goals)?  Read and find it.  It will definitely open your eyes and motivate you to do more.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Good-to-Great/Jim-Collins/e/9780066620992/?pv=y">Good to Great</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Good-to-Great/Jim-Collins/e/9780066620992/?pv=y">Good to Great</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/How-the-Mighty-Fall/Jim-Collins/e/9780977326419/?pv=y">How the Mighty Fall</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>A pathbreaking piece of work...<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Shyamashree_rudra">Shyamashree_rudra</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1141230_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780060516406_BK_3_1141230" href="#previewReview_1141230" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 26, 2009: 
											This is a groundbreaking book that tells us how to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. The subject of Collins' and Porras' study was 'What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the other companies?' By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and newfound fads to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished outstanding companies. They also provide inspiration to entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. This book is an academic treatise, and yet it is superbly written and an exciting read. You could fall asleep on most thesis but this one kept me turning the pages despite being sleepy from a long day's work. I would recommend it to anyone who is serious not about just making quick money, but intent on building sustainable businesses that last.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/37220000/37222969.JPG" alt="" height="157" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Jim Collins</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Boulder, Colorado</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>January 25, 1958</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Aurora, Colorado</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.S. in mathematical sciences, Stanford University, 1980; M.B.A., Stanford University, 1983</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Distinguished Teaching Award, Stanford University Graduate School of Business, 1992</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.jimcollins.com">* Jim Collins's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Collins says he finds</b> the writing process a difficult one. "I can average no more than a page a day of high quality output � and those are long days!" he said in our interview. "If I produce a 30 page chapter, it will take me 30 days of work.  I like what Michener said: 'I am not a master writer.  I am a master rewriter."'    <p>  <b>Collins has been married</b> to wife Joanne for 22 years; the pair got engaged four days after their first date. When I finished <i>Good to Great</i>, Joanne said, �It�s nice to have you back� -- even though I�d been sitting just 20 feet away in the Morris chair for all those months of writing. That�s just the nature of writing a book; it requires a degree of obsession and productive neurosis.  <p>  <b>A passionate rock climber</b>, Collins likes to work early in the morning and then take a break to go climbing on the cliffs of Boulder or Eldorado Canyon. "No matter how wrapped up I am in a piece of work," he says, "it all melts away when I�m focused on the next ten feet of rock. I like to return in the afternoon for a good nap of 30 minutes to two hours, followed by a late afternoon creative work session before spending the evening with Joanne."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>In the fall of 2002, Jim Collins answered some questions from Barnes & Noble.com.</i><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life, and why?</b><br>  If I had to pick one, it would be <i>The Discoverers</i>, by Daniel Boorstin.  I read this book just as I was starting my academic research career, and I was deeply impressed by his central thesis: The primary barrier to progress is not ignorance, but the illusion of knowledge.  <p>    This has affected every aspect of my own approach to questions, research and answers.  In fact, my research laboratory is literally in my old first grade classroom, which reflects the whole idea of fresh inquiry without the burden of carrying too much knowledge.  <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and why?</b><br>  This is a very hard question to answer, as I am a voracious reader.  In fact, you can find my recommended reading list at my web site (www.jimcollins.com), which shows the wide ranging types of reading that have infected my brain over the years.  <p>    I did write an article a number of years ago on my view on non-business books that should be read by business readers.  Here are my picks and reasons, from that article:  <P>  <ul>  <li><i>Chimpanzee Politics</i> by Frans de Waal. Even more enlightening than Machiavelli's <i>The Prince</i>, this book describes power takeovers and social organization in a chimpanzee colony and argues that power politics is part of the evolutionary heritage that we share with our closest non-human relatives. I'll never look at academic or corporate politics the same, and I understand their machinations much better for having read this book. Chimps, unlike humans, do not cloak their political pretenses in rhetoric, so we can see more clearly the process at work and thereby learn much about ourselves.  <p>  <li><i>The Guns of August</i> by Barbara W. Tuchman. This book may well have saved the world from nuclear holocaust. During the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, President Kennedy drew directly upon the lessons of Tuchman's book -- which chronicles how, in August 1914, European nations locked themselves into irreversible political and military positions and thereby needlessly brought about the slaughter of World War I. In the midst of the missile crisis, Kennedy said, "I am not going to follow a course which will allow anyone to write a comparable book [about the missile crisis]." Superbly written, this book teaches valuable lessons on how an organization can be led or driven into calamity through pride, arrogance, and misunderstandings.  <p>  <li><i>Influence</i> by Robert B. Cialdini and <i>The Psychology of Attitude Change and Social Influence</i> by Philip B. Zimbardo. I don't see how anyone can hope to be an effective manager without a basic understanding of social psychology -- the forces of human influence and dynamics of social behavior. These two classic works, both jam-packed with specific examples and fascinating research studies, teach invaluable managerial lessons. For example, revolutionary change can best be accomplished by "incremental revolutionaries," who lead people from A to Z by taking small steps from A to B then B to C then C to D, and so on, such that the step from Y to Z hardly looks like a revolution at all. Another tidbit: Explicitly assign people to play devil's advocate -- to "consider the opposite" -- and thereby dilute the influence of groupthink that so often plays a role in disastrous decisions. Cialdini's book reads better, but I learned more from Zimbardo.<p>  <li><i>In Love and War</i> by Jim and Sybil Stockdale. As the highest ranking P.O.W. in the Hanoi Hilton -- in captivity and under physical and psychological torture for seven years -- Jim Stockdale displayed iron-willed integrity under the most severe conditions. Stockdale teaches that freedom is a state of mind, and that the two greatest weapons of enslavement are guilt and fear, not bars and walls. Stockdale drew strength from Job in the Hebrew Bible, with its central lesson that if you persist in asking 'Why me?' -- if you fail to accept that life is not fair -- you cannot endure. <p>  <li><i>Means of Ascent</i>  (Vol. 2 of <i>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</i>) by Robert A. Caro and <i>Truman</i> by David McCullough. I love biographies. They offer a chance to learn from the experiences of others and to develop role models and anti-models. Caro shows via the rise of LBJ how those consumed by ruthless, amoral ambition can become influential in democracy -- riveting, revealing, and depressing. McCullough, in contrast, inspires with the story of Harry Truman, a failed businessman with rock solid midwestern core values, who rose to become one of the most important and effective presidents in U.S. history.  Taken together, LBJ and Truman demonstrate that while a leader need not be morally grounded to become powerful, the judgment of history depends directly upon one's moral character. Other outstanding biographies: <i>Huey Long</i> by T. Harry Williams, <i>The World is My Home</i> by James A. Michener, and <i>The Last Lion</i> by William Manchester (the preamble to Vol. 2, <i>Alone</i>, is the best 37 pages of biographical prose I've ever read). <p>  <li><i>The Panda's Thumb</i> by Stephen J. Gould. We simply cannot understand our complex world -- including successful organizations -- without grasping the basic elements of evolutionary theory. In fact, we dedicated an entire chapter of <i>Built to Last</i> to how visionary companies like 3M and HP often "evolved" in a way that only in retrospect looks planned. All of Gould's books are superb, but <i>Panda's Thumb</i> is my favorite, and a good place to start. Gould holds himself to a tough standard in his writing: Never dilute or oversimplify concepts for the general public (what academics sneeringly call "dumbing down for the masses") and simultaneously make the concepts accessible and interesting to a wide audience of lay people.  <p>  <li><i>The Second World War</i> by Winston S. Churchill. This 5,000-page, six-volume autobiography and chronicle of the years 1919-1945 is the best book on crisis leadership I've read. Churchill's eloquence comes fully to life as he describes day-by-day the monumental task of holding Britain and, later, the allies together against the Axis powers -- a burden he shouldered at age 65 and carried until age 70. I learned from Churchill the inspirational power of reframing difficult times into a broader goal. When the whole world wondered in 1940 "Can Britain survive?" Churchill countered that the goal was not to survive, but to prevail. Brilliant!</ul>    That article was written in 1995.  Since then, I would add the following to the short list:  <P>  <ul>  <li><i>Personal History</i> by Katharine Graham.  If you were going to read one, and only one, CEO memoir, this would be it. Graham is simply one of the greatest corporate leaders of our age. Her book is profoundly honest and moving.    <li><i>The Power Broker</i> by Robert A. Caro. Certainly one of the greatest biographies ever written. A portrait of a man who was the Michael Jordan of the ability to use power. Caro portrays how Robert Moses at first used power to get things done, but as he ages, Moses uses power simply because he can. Scary. Riveting.      <li><i>The Lords of Discipline</i> by Pat Conroy. Most people know Conroy for <i>The Prince of Tides</i>, but this is my favorite Conroy book because its subject matter speaks to all of us -- whether we came from dysfunctional families or not -- for it is about friendship.  Sometimes you just love a book, and I love this book.      <li><i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> by John Steinbeck. The sign of a truly great book is that it is borne of the times, but speaks to us in a timeless way years or decades later. I was stunned by the near-perfection of Steinbeck�s craft. A timeless model of The Great American Novel.      <li><i>The Right Stuff</i> by Tom Wolfe. Tom Wolfe at his very best. He just nailed the psychology of the test pilot. One of the few books I�ve read more than once.</ul>    <b>Favorite movies?</b><Br>  <ul><li><i>Apocalypse Now</i>  <li><i>Star Wars � Empire Strikes Back</i>  <li><i>Lawrence of Arabia</i></ul>    <b>Favorite music?</b><br>  I love great music. I often sit in my Morris chair in the living room, with Mr. Yang (one of our cats) curled up on the warmth of the CD player, while I write on my laptop and listen to music. (In fact, I am doing exactly that as I write these words, with Beethoven Symphony No. 9 playing away, while Mr. Yang sits like a Sphinx on the stereo.) A few of my favorites, during writing time:<ul>    <li>Bach: <i>Goldberg Variations</i>  <li>Mozart: <i>Symphony No. 40 in C Minor</i>  <li>Haydn: <i>Cello Concerto No. 1</i>, String Quartets  <li>Beethoven: <i>Symphony No. 7</i>, <i>Violin Concerto</i>  <li>Brahms: <i>Symphony No. 3</i>, <i>Tragic Overture</i>  <li>Tchaikovsky: <i>Serenade for Strings</i>  <li>Dvorak: <i>New World Symphony</i>, <i>Cello Concerto</i>  <li>Stravinsky: <i>Rite of Spring</i>, <i>Firebird Suite</i>  <li>Mahler: <i>Symphony No. 1</i>, <i>Symphony No. 5</i>  </ul>  When working out in my rock climbing gym, though, I tend to go for Hendrix, Zeppelin, Stones, Talking Heads, Santana, etc.   <p>    <b>Who are your favorite writers, and why?</b><br>    I tend to go in streaks. If I find an author I really like, I tend to work through most or all of his or her writings. Here are a few of the writers whose work I�ve devoured, along with my favorite work by each:  <ul>  <li>Pat Conroy � <i>Lords of Discipline</i>  <li>Stephen J. Gould � <i>The Panda�s Thumb</i>  <li>Tracy Kidder � <i>Soul of a New Machine</i>  <li>William Manchester � <i>The Last Lion</i>  <li>David McCullough -- <i>Truman</i>  <li>John McPhee � <i>The Control of Nature</i>  <li>J.K. Rowling � <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>  <li>William Shakespeare � <i>Midsummer Night�s Dream</i>  <li>Irving Stone � <i>Men to Match My Mountains</i>  <li>Barbara Tuchman � <i>Guns of August</i>  <li>Tom Wolfe � <i>The Right Stuff</i>  </ul>    <b>What else do you want your readers to know?</b><Br>  I would like them to know how much I appreciate their time. The purchase price of a book is not $27.50, or whatever the store price. The real purchase price of a book is the opportunity cost of how else a person could spend the time. That so many people would freely choose to spend ten hours or so digesting our work is just a wonderful feeling.<h3>Feature Essay</h3><i>In 2001, Jim Collins contributed this exclusive essay to Barnes & Noble.com about his book </i> Good to Great.<p>    In 1994,  my life changed dramatically when <i>Built to Last</i>, the book I coauthored with Jerry Porras about what it takes to build enduring great companies, became a wholly unexpected bestseller.  Oddly, I responded by going into a deep existential funk.  After six years of immersion, I no longer had a big project to work on.  It was like I'd returned from the Lewis and Clark expedition with no new outlet in which to channel my somewhat obsessive energies.  I woke up every morning and wondered, What on earth am I going to do next?  My anxiety only worsened as I felt pressure from all sides -- agents, publishers, pundits -- to "get on with the next one to capitalize on the first one."  <p>   Fortunately, my wife, Joanne, pulled me out of the muck.  "Don't pick another question just to do another book," she admonished.  "Wait until a question picks you."  <p>  It was great advice.  And I began to wait...and wait...and wait.  A month went by.  Then six months.  Then a year.  Then nearly two years.  I began to have a sinking feeling that I would never again have a worthy question that would capture my passion and imagination.  <p>  But then at a dinner with people gathered to discuss organizational change and performance, a McKinsey partner leaned over his salad and said, "You know Jim, we love <i>Built to Last</i> around here.  But unfortunately, it's useless."  <p>  Useless?  Six years of my life, useless?  <p>  "The companies you wrote about were, for the most part, always great," he said.  "They never had to turn themselves from good companies into great companies.  They had parents like David Packard and George Merck, who shaped the character of greatness from early on.  But what about the vast majority of companies that wake up partway through life and realize that they're good, but not great?"    <p>  His observation proved to be an invaluable gift.  It planted the seed of a question that became the basis of the next five years of my life, namely, Can a good company become a great company and, if so, how?    <p>  The question of good to great captured me on a deep level as not just a business question but a human question.  For the truth is, good is the enemy of great.  And that is one of the key reasons why we have so little that becomes great.  We don't have great schools, principally because we have good schools.  We don't have great government, principally because we have good government.  Few people attain great lives, in large part because it is just so easy to settle for a good life.  And the vast majority of companies never become great, precisely because the vast majority become quite good -- and that is their main problem.  <p>  Five years after that fateful dinner (and 20,000 hours of research time with my team), I can now say, without question, that good to great does happen, and we've learned much about the underlying variables that make it happen.  <i>Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't</i> is the culmination.  And while I fully expect another bout with existential despair in the wake of publication, I wouldn't trade the journey for anything.    <p>  If we have cracked the code on good to great, then we might see good schools become great schools, good government become great government, good companies become great companies and perhaps even a number of good lives become great lives.  And that has made the effort worth every minute.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>The Barnes & Noble Review</b><br>Jim Collins and Jerry Porras begin their groundbreaking analysis of "visionary companies" with the following bold statement: "We believe every CEO, manager, and entrepreneur should read this book."  Although their language may sound slightly hubristic, the authors actually deliver the promised goods:  Written in eloquent and accessible language, <i>Built to Last</i>, the result of an extensive six-year research study conducted at Stanford University, is a classic business book that surely deserves the accolades critics, readers, and its creators have heaped upon it.
<p>
Collins and Porras begin by defining the type of organizations they intend to examine.  American Express, Ford, GE, Nordstrom, and Walt Disney are some of the 18 visionary companies -- widely admired, crown-jewel institutions that were founded before 1950 and have left "an indelible imprint on the world in which we live" -- to fall into the purview of their study.  The authors then proceed to offer 12 management myths shattered by their research into these companies.  Perhaps the most significant of these debunked pieces of conventional wisdom is the idea that change is the sole constant in the business world.  Instead, Collins and Porras argue, "a visionary company almost religiously preserves its core ideology -- changing it seldom, if ever."  From this adherence to a fundamental set of beliefs or a deeply held sense of self-identity comes the discipline and drive that enables a company to succeed in rapidly changing, volatile environments.
<p>
One of the enjoyable things about reading <i>Built to Last</i> is that its authors consciously chose to avoid the trendy phrases that sometimes make business books seem no more weighty or enduring than magazine articles.  Instead, Collins and Porras have written a book that is meaningful, passionate, based on careful study, and, in its own way, built to last.  <i>(Sunil Sharma)</i>

</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>"<b>Good to Great</b> is about turning good results into great results; <b>Built to Last</b> is about turning great results into an enduring great company." so write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time.</p> <p>Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day, as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large companies. Throughout, the authors asked&#58; "What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?"</p> <p>Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished outstanding companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.</p> <p>Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.</p>

An innovative and inspiring study of the culture and longevity of some of America's most successful organizations, <I>Built to Last</I> is a blueprint for building organizations that will endure long into the twenty-first century. <p></p> In <I>Built to Last</I>, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras identify the unique characteristics of visionary companies and show how any business can cultivate them. From Merck to Philip Morris, from General Electric to Nordstrom, from Ford to Sony, visionary companies display an amazing resilience and an unshakable commitment to their core ideology that allows them to surpass even their more temporarily successful competitors and achieve a lasting place in the cultural landscape. <p></p> By examining the founding and history of these companies, the ways in which they have handled both adversity and success, and their continued commitment to their corporate identity, Collins and Porras reveal the unique characteristics of these visionary companies and show what actions other companies may take to achieve the same level of long-lastingperformance. <p></p> <i>Questions for Discussion of <I>Built to Last</I></i> <LI> Why do you think the authors chose to use the term "visionary" to describe the companies profiled in the book rather than "successful" or "great"? <P><LI> The authors state that "as extraordinary as they are, the visionary companies do not have perfect, unblemished records" and then cite specific examples: Walt Disney faced a serious cash flow crisis in 1939 which forced it to go public. Boeing had serious difficulties in the mid-1930s, the late 1940s, and again in the 1970s when it laid off over sixty thousand employees. What allowed these two and the other visionary companies to bounce back from severe adversity? <P><LI> Myth number one debunked in the book is that "it takes a great idea to start a great company." Do you agree that this is a myth? Cite some examples of visionary companies that did not start with a great idea. Discuss the other myths that the authors "shatter." <P><LI> The authors quote Bill Hewlett of Hewlett-Packard as saying, "When I talk to business schools occasionally, the professor of management is devastated when I say that we didn't have any plans when we started-we were just opportunistic. We did anything that would bring in a nickel." Why do you think this is a disconcerting notion to many people, in this particular case to management professors? What is that they want to hear? <P><LI> Which of the visionary companies do you think is the most successful, and why? How do its business practices differ from its "comparison" company? <P><LI> The authors believe their findings "will apply more in the twenty-first century than in the twentieth. In particular, the essential ideas to come from our work�will continue to be key concepts long into the future." Do you agree that their findings will endure well into the future?

They never had to turn themselves from good companies into great companies� But what about the vast majority of companies that wake up and part way through life and realize that they're good, but not great?" What do you think of this statement? What is there to be learned from each of the books? <P><LI> Jim Collins said that <I>Good to Great</I> is a prequel to <I>Built to Last</I>. Do you see it this way? Do the two books work in tandem with one another? <P><LI> In <I>Good to Great</I>, Wells Fargo is profiled as one of the "good-to-great" companies. In <I>Built to Last</I>, Wells Fargo is not one of the visionary companies but rather the comparison for visionary company American Express. Discuss the implications of this. <P><LI> Collins states, "We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we've uncovered." Do you agree with this statement? Why or why not? In what instances do you think the concepts set forth in <I>Good to Great</I> and <I>Built to Last</I> would work best? In what instance do you think they would not be successful? Do you think the theories laid out in each of the books can be applied to <i>any</i> industry? <P><LI> Which of the company success stories did you find the most surprising, and why? </ol>
<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><h3 align="center">Chapter One</h3><p>This is not a book about charismatic visionary leaders. It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary market insights. Nor even is it about just having a corporate vision.<p>This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about <b>visionary companies.</b><p>What is a visionary company? Visionary companies are premier institutions-the crown jewels - in their industries, widely admired by their peers and having a long track record of making a significant impact on the world around them. The key point is that a visionary company is an organization - an institution. All individual leaders, no matter how charismatic or visionary, eventually die; and all visionary products and services-all "great ideas" - eventually become obsolete. Indeed, entire markets can become obsolete and disappear. Yet visionary companies prosper over long periods of time, through multiple product life cycles and multiple generations of active leaders.<p>Pause for a moment and compose your own mental list of visionary companies; try to think of five to ten organizations that meet the following criteria:<P><ul><li>Premier institution in its industry </li><li>Widely admired by knowledgeable businesspeople </li><li>Made an indelible imprint on the world in which we live </li><li>Had multiple generations of chief executives </li><li>Been through multiple product (or service) life cycles </li><li>Founded before 1950 </li></ul>Examine your list of companies. What about them particularly impresses you? Notice any common themes? What might explain their enduring quality and prosperity. How might they be different from other companiesthat had the same opportunities in life, but didn't attain the same stature?<p>In a six-year research project, we set out to identify and systematically research the historical development of a set of visionary companies, to examine how they differed from a carefully selected control set of comparison companies, and to thereby discover the underlying factors that account for their extraordinary long-term position. This book presents the findings of our research project and their practical implications.<p>We wish to be clear right up front: The "comparison companies" in our study are not dog companies, nor are they entirely unvisionary. Indeed, they are good companies, having survived in most cases as long as the visionary companies and, as you'll see, having outperformed the general stock market. But they don't quite match up to the overall stature of the visionary com- panies in our study. In most cases, you can think of the visionary company as the gold medalist and the comparison company as the silver or bronze medalist. We chose the term "visionary" companies, rather than just "successful" or "enduring" companies, to reflect the fact that they have distinguished themselves as a very special and elite breed of institutions. They are morethan successful. They are <I>more</I> than enduring. In most cases, they are the best of the best in thdir industries, and have been that way for decades. Many of them have served as role models -icons, really - for the practice of management around the world. (Table 1. 1 shows the companies in our study. We wish to be clear that the companies in our study are not the only visionary companies in existence. We will explain in a few pages how we came up with these particular companies.)<p>Yet as extraordinary as they are, the visionary companies do not have perfect, unblemished records. (Examine your own list of visionary companies. We suspect that most if not all of them have taken a serious tumble at least once during their history, probably multiple times.) Walt Disney faced a serious cash flow crisis in 1939 which forced it to go public; later, in the early 1980s, the company nearly ceased to exist as an independent entity as corporate raiders eyed its depressed stock price. Boeing had serious diffi-culties in the,mid-1930s, the late 1940s, and again in the early 1970s when it laid off over sixty thousand employees. 3M began life as a failed mine and almost went out of business in the early 1900s. Hewlett-Packard faced severe cutbacks in 1945; in 1990, it watched its stock drop to a price below book value. Sony had repeated product failures during its first five years of life (1945-1950), and in the 1970s saw its Beta format lose to VHS in the battle for market dominance in VCRs.

<a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><I>Built to Last</I><br>Successful Habits of Visionary Companies<h3 align="center">Chapter One</h3><p>This is not a book about charismatic visionary leaders. It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary market insights. Nor even is it about just having a corporate vision.<p>This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about <I>visionary companies.</I><p>What is a visionary company? Visionary companies are premier institutions -- the crown jewels -- in their industries, widely admired by their peers and having a long track record of making a significant impact on the world around them. The key point is that a visionary company is an organization -- an institution. All individual leaders, no matter how charismatic or visionary, eventually die; and all visionary products and services -- all "great ideas" -- eventually become obsolete. Indeed, entire markets can become obsolete and disappear. Yet visionary companies prosper over long periods of time, through multiple product life cycles and multiple generations of active leaders.<p>Pause for a moment and compose your own mental list of visionary companies; try to think of five to ten organizations that meet the following criteria:<P><ul><li>Premier institution in its industry </li><li>Widely admired by knowledgeable businesspeople </li><li>Made an indelible imprint on the world in which we live </li><li>Had multiple generations of chief executives </li><li>Been through multiple product (or service) life cycles </li><li>Founded before 1950 </li></ul>Examine your list of companies. What about them particularly impresses you? Notice any common themes? What might explain their enduring quality and prosperity? How might they be different from other companies that had the same opportunities in life, but didn't attain the same stature?<p>In a six-year research project, we set out to identify and systematically research the historical development of a set of visionary companies, to examine how they differed from a carefully selected control set of comparison companies, and to thereby discover the underlying factors that account for their extraordinary long-term position. This book presents the findings of our research project and their practical implications.<p>We wish to be clear right up front: The "comparison companies" in our study are not dog companies, nor are they entirely unvisionary. Indeed, they are good companies, having survived in most cases as long as the visionary companies and, as you'll see, having outperformed the general stock market. But they don't quite match up to the overall stature of the visionary companies in our study. In most cases, you can think of the visionary company as the gold medalist and the comparison company as the silver or bronze medalist. We chose the term "visionary" companies, rather than just "successful" or "enduring" companies, to reflect the fact that they have distinguished themselves as a very special and elite breed of institutions. They are more than successful. They are <I>more</I> than enduring. In most cases, they are the best of the best in their industries, and have been that way for decades. Many of them have served as role models -- icons, really -- for the practice of management around the world. (Table 1. 1 shows the companies in our study. We wish to be clear that the companies in our study are not the only visionary companies in existence. We will explain in a few pages how we came up with these particular companies.)<p>Yet as extraordinary as they are, the visionary companies do not have perfect, unblemished records. (Examine your own list of visionary companies. We suspect that most if not all of them have taken a serious tumble at least once during their history, probably multiple times.) Walt Disney faced a serious cash flow crisis in 1939 which forced it to go public; later, in the early 1980s, the company nearly ceased to exist as an independent entity as corporate raiders eyed its depressed stock price. Boeing had serious difficulties in the mid-1930s, the late 1940s, and again in the early 1970s when it laid off over sixty thousand employees. 3M began life as a failed mine and almost went out of business in the early 1900s. Hewlett-Packard faced severe cutbacks in 1945; in 1990, it watched its stock drop to a price below book value. Sony had repeated product failures during its first five years of life (1945-1950), and in the 1970s saw its Beta format lose to VHS in the battle for market dominance in VCRs. Ford posted one of the largest annual losses in American business history ($3.3 billion in three years) in the early 1980s before it began an impressive turnaround and long-needed revitalization. Citicorp (founded in 1812, the same year Napoleon marched to Moscow) languished in the late 1800s, during the 1930s Depression, and again in the late 1980s when it struggled with its global loan portfolio. IBM was nearly bankrupt in 1914, then again in 1921, and is having trouble again in the early 1990s. <P><CENTER><TABLE align=middle width=400><CAPTION>Table 1.1<H3>The companies in our Research Study</H3></CAPTION><TBODY><TR><TD><I>Visionary Company</I><P>3M<BR>American Express<BR>Boeing<BR>Citicorp<BR>Ford<BR>General Electric<BR>Hewlett-Packard<BR>IBM<BR>Johnson & Johnson<BR>Marriott<BR>Merck<BR>Motorola<BR>Nordstrom<BR>Philip Morris<BR>Procter & Gamble<BR>Sony<BR>Wal-Mart<BR>Walt Disney<BR></P></TD><TD><I>Comparision Company</I><P>Norton<BR>Wells Fargo<BR>McDonnell Douglas <BR>Chase Manhattan <BR>GM <BR>Westinghouse <BR>Texas Instruments<BR>Burroughs <BR>Bristol-Myers Squibb <BR>Howard Johnson<BR>Pfizer <BR>Zenith <BR>Melville <BR>RJR Nabisco <BR>Colgate<BR>Kenwood <BR>Ames <BR>Columbia<BR></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></p> <I><I>Built to Last</I><br>Successful Habits of Visionary Companies</I>.
