											In Baton Rouge, Night Watch vampire slayer Sandra "Dee" Daniels stalks the night wearing pointed heels while seeking the undead.  She is sworn to protect humanity from these predators.  She is quite good at what she does until she meets Simon Chase as he makes her desire him. <p/><p/>Dee has learned she will be converted to a genetically altered human who dies and returns as a vampire.  Her current mission is to prevent a rogue "born" again Master who has vamps fleeing him. She wants to stop the villain from turning the bayou into a red sea.  However, as dangerous as that is, she feels the most perilous person to her well being is Simon; he shares her intense passion and ire.  As each planned to use the other, neither anticipated the feelings that develop for each other; but stalking Baton Rouge remains the Born Master Vampire..<p/><p/>I'll Be Slaying You is a heated Bayou romantic fantasy as two individuals find their respective souls when they fall in love.  Both understand the grim mission, but each hides something critical from their lover as trust does not come easy to either of them.  Readers will enjoy the star-crossed romance between the vampire and the vampire slayer.<p/><p/>Harriet Klausner</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Cynthia Eden returns to the realm of the Other, where the supernatural bounty hunters of Night Watch work hard and play harder...<P>Sandra "Dee" Daniels is a vampire's worst nightmare.

Shaking  her head, she reached for her weapon and followed.  <p>     They didn't see her when she rounded the corner. The guy  had the woman pinned up against the wall, his hands shoved  under her skirt, and his face buried between her very, very ample  breasts. He groaned and grunted and she moaned and twisted  against him.  <p>     Dee blew out a hard breath as she waited. Not for them to  finish, but for the monster to show itself.  <p>     Probably in about ten more seconds, maybe less, cause  they were getting pretty hot over there and-  <p>     The woman, a long-legged redhead, opened her mouth wide.  Thanks to the spill of lights from the building's second story  windows, Dee got a great view of that mouth.  <p>     And of the woman's two-inch long fangs.  <p>     <i>Got you.</i>  <p>     Fangs that were currently heading right for the idiot's neck  as the vamp prepared to rip open his throat and guzzle his  blood like a frat boy enjoying the cheapest beer in town.  <p>     Death wishes. Would people never learn?  <p>     Dee cleared her throat. "Ah, excuse me?"  <p>     The shiny white fangs froze over the guy's neck.  <p>     <i>"What the fuck?"</i> From the idiot. The man still didn't know  how close death was to him. Judging from what Dee could see,  it looked like death was about, oh, an inch away.  <p>     He swung around to face her. Early twenties, preppy, with  a face that she judged as handsome, if kind of bland.  <p>     Dee smiled at him. "Hi, there."  <p>     His gaze raked her and the vamp hissed.  <p>     Vamps always got pissy when their food was taken away.  <p>     "I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave," Dee  murmured. The fangs were too close to his carotid artery. The  vamp might get twitchy and decide to take a bite, and, well,  Dee's shirt was white and when she snatched the dude free,  she'd ruin her shirt with that dark red splash. Not that it was  anything fancy, but ...  <p>     She really hated doing laundry.  <p>     "Get. The. Fuck. Away." Bland/handsome snarled at her.  <p>     Ah, now some people could almost deserve a bite from a  vamp, but-no, she was being paid for this gig.  <p>     The vamp smiled at her. "You heard him. Leave, bitch."  <p>     Dee lifted her weapon. Not her gun, that was still holstered  at her side, but the wooden stake was an easy and familiar  weight in her hand. "Just how long do you think it's gonna  take me to shove this into your heart? A minute? Less?"  <p>     <i>"Jesus Christ!"</i> The guy's eyes bulged. "You're crazy!"  <p>     Debatable.  <p>     "Come on, Karen, let's get the hell out of-"  <p>     The vamp grabbed him and twisted the man around. <i>Using  him as a shield.</i> Why did the vampires always do that with  their prey? Like a human shield was ever going to stop her.  Dee just shook her head.  <p>     "You take so much as a step, and I break his neck."  <p>     She could do it. Vampire strength. She'd snap him in half a  second, but ... "I'll be on you before his body hits the ground."  <p>     The man whimpered.  <p>     The vamp's eyes flashed to black. <i>"Who are you?"</i>  <p>     "Just a woman who was hired to do a job." This wasn't a  kill mission, but if there was no choice, she'd bring her prey  down any way she could.  <p>     Besides, vamps were already <i>dead</i>, so it wasn't like she was  really breaking the old bring-'em-in-alive rule, anyway. Not  that the Night Watch Agency really followed that rule. Not  when the bounty hunters were after dangerous supernaturals.  <p>     "I'm getting bored," Dee said, "let him go and come with  me."  <p>     The guy was crying now. Sobbing. Hell.  <p>     The vamp's gaze darted from Dee back to the edge of the  street. Desperation there. Fear.  <p>     Time for the takedown. "Let him go," she repeated, voice  lashing out, and then, Dee heard the faintest sound.  <p>     A soft rustle. A footstep?          Behind her.  <p>     She tensed.  <p>     The fear faded from the vamp's eyes and a smile tilted her  lips.  <p>     Uh, oh.  <p>     "Take the bitch out!" The vampire screamed and Dee  knew that the person behind her wasn't just some innocent  bystander drawn in by morbid curiosity. Not innocent at all.  Shit.  <p>     She spun around, ready to face another vampire, ready to-  <p>     He lunged at her, hitting her hard and fast and slamming  her ass right down to the ground. At that same instant, she  heard the shot. A crack of fire that would have taken her out.  <p>     Had her ass not been on the ground.  <p>     A hard cry broke the night. Pain. Fear. Not her cry, because  she'd learned long ago not to cry out.  <p>     Dee stared up at the man before her. <i>Darkness</i>.  <p>     Black hair, hair much longer than her own. Sharp-edged,  hard features. Cold, gray eyes, thin lips. Cheekbones that jutted  too sharply.  <p>     And his body ... his weight pinned her to the ground. His  body was tight with muscle, heavy with strength.  <p>     He felt hot against her. His flesh so warm and-  <p>     Ah, fuck it.  <p>     Dee rammed up with her elbow, catching him hard and  fast in the chin, sending his head snapping back as she scrambled  beneath him, twisting, jerking, and punching.  <p>     "Stop it! Shit-I just saved your ass!" He clamped down  harder on her, freezing her movements. "Woman, someone  just tried to shoot you!"  <p>     And some big and thick asshole had tackled her.  <p>     But the crack she'd heard had registered in her mind now  and the cry of pain-  <p>     If it hadn't been hers, then it had been ...  <p>     Damn. Her neck craned and she glanced back. The idiot  lay on the ground, moaning. Not with passion anymore.  Pain. Blood soaked his shirt and pooled around him.  <p>     The vamp was gone.  <p>     But was the shooter? Only one way to find out. "Get off,"  she gritted.  <p>     His jaw clenched but he rolled to the side. "Your funeral,  babe."  <p>     She'd lost her stake. Whatever. She had plenty more in the  car. Dee jerked her gun free of the holster. She scanned the  buildings, the darkness.  <p>     It was at times like these when being a human was a real  vulnerability for her. The shifter hunters who worked for Night  Watch would never have been caught off guard like this. They  would have caught the shooter's scent on the wind, heard  him creeping up for the shot.  <p>     Even the demons would have gotten more warning than  she had.  <p>     But when you played with the big boys, you didn't get to  piss and moan about the extra senses you didn't possess.  <p>     So she scanned every building. Every shadow. Then, staying  as low and keeping as much cover as she could, she went  to the idiot.  <p>     "Help me! I'm dying! You've got to-"  <p>     Her gaze darted over him. A lot of blood. Huh. And the  vamp had run away from that? Who ran when the buffet was  free?  <p>     <i>"Help me!</i> I can't die like this, I can't-"  <p>     "You're not dying." Jeez. She yanked out her phone, then  pressed the button that would send an SOS to the surveillance  team at Night Watch. "It's a flesh wound, moron." She'd sure  had her share of them.  <p>     "Dispatch." A soft, modulated voice flowed over the line.  <p>     "Need an ambulance." She didn't identify herself. Why  bother? Stella would recognize her voice. "Four fifteen Brantley.  <p>     Human down and-"  <p>     Sirens wailed in the night. Of damn course. The shot  would have attracted attention.  <p>     Her fingers tightened around the phone. "Never mind."  <p>     Hell.  <p>     Time for explanations.  <p>     Or, okay, lies.  <p>     "What do we say?"  <p>     The deep, rumbling voice came from the left. From Mr. Tall,  Dark, and, yeah, Sexy, who'd tailed her over to the victim.  She spared him a glance. "You can get out of here. I'll handle  the cops." She'd had lots of experience with the Baton Rouge  PD. Most of the uniforms owed her, anyway.  <p>     One black brow shot up. "It's okay, you don't have to thank  me." A grin flashed, one that showed a lot of strong, white  teeth. "I was happy to save your life. Really. Think nothing of  it. Yeah, I nearly got shot, but I'm okay. No need for concern."  His right hand lifted and gingerly rubbed his chin.  <p>     A patrol car rounded the corner, screeched to a stop, and  Dee clenched her teeth. "Thank you," she managed.  <p>     "Not very gracious, are you?" he murmured, and he knelt,  his hands going toward the moaning guy's wounds. "You  should work on that."  <p>     Her eyes slit. "I didn't need saving." Cops were approaching.  She could see them from the corner of her eye. Their guns  were up, their steps slow.  <p>     "Yeah, you did."  <p>     She almost growled at him. Any minute now, the cops  would be saying-  <p>     "Put your hands up! Nice and slow and-"  <p>     Ah, good. She recognized that voice. "Harry, we've got a  gunshot vic here. He needs to be routed to Mercy General."  <p>     <i>"Dee?"</i> Not real surprise. More like horror.  <p>     "Yeah. Be careful, the shooter could still be around."  <p>     Harry and his partner immediately crouched. Harry jerked  out his radio and barked some commands.  <p>     "Why am I not surprised that the cops know you?" Dark  and Sexy murmured.  <p>     She spared him a withering glance. Then she leaned in  close to the victim and whispered, "If you want to stay out of  the psych ward, don't say a word about the vampire."  <p>     He blinked once, then gave a quick, jerky nod.  <p>     <i>Good.</i> Because the cops on scene didn't understand the  paranormal score in this town, and if the vic started rambling  about Dee trying to take down an undead bloodsucker,  things could get tricky.  <p>     She eased back into her crouch. So much for an easy bag.  The guys at Night Watch would be giving her hell about this  one for days.  <p>     And who'd been out there with the gun? Why had the  shooter been aiming for her?  <p>     She'd find out. As soon as damn possible.  <p>     Because no one took a free shot at her and got away. No  one.  <p>  <p>     Sandra "Dee" Daniels was small, grubby, and she really,  really shouldn't have been attractive.  <p>     Her blond hair barely skimmed her chin and it looked like  the woman had taken scissors to it herself-leaving the hair  in short, twisted layers. Her nose was a little off center, her  bottom lip a little too big, her chin a little too pointed.  <p>     No, she shouldn't have been attractive.  <p>     The jeans she wore were ripped and faded. Her white T-shirt  clung too tightly to her small breasts, and her black boots were  scuffed pretty much to hell and back.  <p>     But-  <p>     But she was damn sexy. Maybe it was the eyes. So big and  dark. Chocolate. Once upon a time, he'd loved the stuff.  <p>     And that mouth. The lips were lush, soft, so red. Okay, so  maybe he liked her mouth.  <p>     A lot.  <p>     She had her hands balled into fists on her hips. Cops were  everywhere, running like ants as they searched the scene. He'd  already been questioned three times, and both he and Dee  had been given the all clear to leave.  <p>     But the woman wasn't moving, and if she wasn't moving,  neither was he.  <p>     After five minutes of silence from her, she finally deigned  to glance his way. "Harry said you could leave, buddy."  <p>     "Simon. Simon Chase." She knew his name. She'd been right  there when he spelled it for the uniforms. Each time.  <p>     She grunted.  <p>     He almost smiled. Almost. "Ah, I can't help but notice,  Sandra-"  <p>     <i>"Dee."</i> Her voice snapped like a whip.  <p>     He'd been there when she had to spell her name, too. He'd  rather enjoyed her gruff, <i>"Harry, you know this shit, S-A-ND-R-A  ... oh, fuck off."</i>  <p>     "Dee," he allowed. But he'd be calling her Sandra again  soon. He liked that. Liked the way her cheeks flushed so red  when she heard the name. "You don't seem too upset that  someone tried to kill you tonight."  <p>     The victim had been hauled away in an ambulance. Blood  still soaked the ground, but Simon didn't glance at it. His  nostrils twitched, just a bit, but the scent was starting to fade.  <p>     She rolled her shoulders in a little shrug. "Not like it's the  first time."  <p>     He let his eyes widen. "Really."  <p>     A grunt from her. She seemed to like that sound.  <p>     "And you have no idea why folks want you dead?"  <p>     A furrow peaked between her golden brows. "No clue."  <p>     Right.  <p>     Her hands lifted, then fell in a vague little gesture. "Well,  it's been fun, Chase, but I've got work to do."  <p>     He pulled the wooden stake from his back pocket. "Just  what kind of work is it that you do, Sandra?"  <p>     Red flush. She lunged for him and locked her fingers around  the stake, but he didn't let go. She was close now, close enough  that he could see light flecks of gold in her dark gaze. Close  enough that he could see the pulse pounding at the base of  her throat. Close enough that he could almost taste those  lips.  <p>     He tightened his hold on the stake. The wood was smooth  and hard. The woman had obviously spent some time honing  her weapon.  <p>     "Give it to me." She glanced back over her shoulder. "I  don't want to have to explain this shit to all of them right  now, not with the last silver shooting still hanging over me."  <p>     Silver shooting? Sounded like an interesting story.  <p>     Slowly, he released his hold and she jerked the weapon  from him. Kneeling, she shoved the weapon into some kind  of custom holster near her ankle.  <p>     When she lifted the ragged hem of her jeans, he caught  sight of her leg. Nice. Smooth and pale and-  <p>     She shot back up, nearly clipping him in the chin. Again.  <p>     Simon shook his head. She was so not what he'd been expecting.  "You didn't answer me," he said and tried to ignore  her scent. A heady scent, rich and dark. A woman's sensual  flavor.  <p>     She licked her lips. A quick swipe of her tongue that had  his cock jerking.  <p>     Definitely <i>not</i> what he'd been expecting, but he wasn't  going to complain. No way.  <p>     "Trust me on this, you don't want to know." She shuffled  back a few steps and tossed him a careless smile. "Thanks for  watching my ass tonight, Chase."  <p>     Then she was gone. Turning away and marching through  the cops still on scene, and he kept watching that ass. Nice  and firm, round enough to hold tight.  <p>     Yeah, he kept watching that ass, right until the moment  she disappeared around the corner.  <p>     He waited a beat. Two.  <p>     Then he stalked after her because he wasn't about to let his  prey escape that quickly. There'd be no fun in such an easy  exit.  <p>     He followed her, giving brief, polite nods to the cops as he  made his way past their vehicles.  <p>     It only took a moment to realize that Dee wasn't headed  back to the main street. His eyes tracked her. No, the woman  wasn't retreating to the safety of her car. She was snaking  through the back alleys, going even deeper into the underbelly  of the city.  <p>     And she wasn't even glancing back.  <p>     Because she was hunting, too.  <p>     What the hell? The woman had almost been shot, shouldn't  she be hesitating a bit? His hands fisted as he followed her.  The night closed around him, her, and they both hunted.  <p>     The minutes ticked past. Another tight corner. Another  alley. He kept her in his sights. His nostrils stung because these  streets <i>reeked</i>. Garbage. Shit. Who knew what the hell he  was stepping in as he trailed her?  <p>     The woman had better be worth this effort. She'd better-  <p>     He rounded another turn, one that led him between two  thick buildings.  <p>     Dee had vanished.  <p>     He froze and stared straight ahead.  <p>     A soft footfall sounded behind him. Could have been a  whisper, could have been-  <p>     Simon spun around and came face to face with Dee. She  was armed, not with a stake this time, but with her gun, and  the lady had it pointed dead center between his eyes.  <p>     He probably should have acted scared. Should have mumbled  some kind of half-assed apology for following her.  <p>     Instead, he just stared at her.  <p>     "There a particular reason why you're tailing me?"  The gun didn't waver. Those sexy-as-sin lips pressed into a  thick line.  <p>     "Yeah." He allowed himself a glance down her body. He'd  have to be careful with her. He kept forgetting how small and  fragile she was.  <p>     <i>Maybe because of the gun.</i> Maybe that was making him  forgetful.  <p>     She acted tough. But that body-soft curves and sweet,  tender flesh.  <p>     "Eyes up, asshole."  <p>     Apparently the lady didn't like him ogling her breasts. Fair  enough. "You left before I could get your number."  <p>     Her jaw dropped. <i>"What?"</i>  <p>     He shrugged. "Your number. I mean, I saved your life.  Shouldn't I at least be able to get your number for that?"  <p>     She growled and finally lowered the gun. "Look, buddy-"  <p>     "Simon Chase."  <p>     "Whatever. I don't have time for this shit. I'm not going to  screw you because you shoved me into the pavement. And,  just so you know, I didn't need you to save me. Not like it's  my first ball game, okay?"  <p>     <i>I'm not going to screw you.</i> Hmmm. "Don't remember  asking for a screw." Though he wouldn't refuse one with her.  "Just your number."  <p>     She barred her teeth. Pretty teeth. White and straight. Not  too sharp, though, but then, she was human.  <p>     His tongue scraped across his own teeth. A bit sharper  than hers.  <p>     "I'm working now, I don't have time for this-"  <p>     "Yeah, you never did answer my question." Simon cocked  his head to the side. "Just what kind of work do you do?"  <p>     She holstered the gun. "The kind you wouldn't understand."  <p>     Doubtful. "Let's see ... you had a wooden stake and you  were about ten feet away from a vampire the first time I saw  you." He paused. "I'd say that makes you a hunter."  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>I'll Be Slaying You</b> by <b>Cynthia Eden</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Cindy Roussos.
