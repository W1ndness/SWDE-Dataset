Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer&#58; Please, Santa, come back from the dead.<p>But hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say "Kris Kringle" he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.<p>Only Christopher Moore,...</p><h3>The New York Times - 
												Janet Maslin</h3><p>While this book is not Mr. Moore's best or wildest, it is buoyant enough to look like his big, overdue breakout. Chalk that up to the confluence of fruit bat, Warrior Babe, handcuffs and merrily warped holiday spirit. And his earlier work has reached critical mass, to the point at which Mr. Moore is clearly the unhinged Hiaasen. He's "Daily Show"-funny and willing to subvert anything, even the "pile of dead Kringle" that sets this fractured fairy tale in motion.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>With a body of work that boasts some of the most outlandish plots and outrageous characters ever to make it onto the printed page, Christopher Moore is rapidly making a name for himself as the clown prince of contemporary fiction.

											I loved Moore's other books, and I do consider him a good author. But I think the Stupidest Angel is probably his worst book so far. The plot is just over the top and it seems to be all over the place in my opinion. His humor and wit isn't as sharp as it is in other books like Lamb or A Dirty Job.<p/>It is a quick read and there is some enjoyment to be had, but overall the story and writing is more childish. A lot of characters from his other books make an appearance in this one as is tradition with Moore. If you you're a fan of Moore you may want to read it anyway. I think the main reason it's weaker is because he states someone asked him to write a Christmas story and that could have caused a strain on the brain. Anyway the book is okay, but it's sadly not his best work.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Fantastic Christmas stocking stuffer along with &quot;Lamb&quot; by Christopher Moore<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Mellee">Mellee</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1384137_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780060842352_BK_1_1384137" href="#previewReview_1384137" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 12, 2010: 
											I read the original and laughed my ass off! The enhanced version adds a fantastic additional chapter at no additional cost to the reader. I would highly recommend both books as a Christmas stocking stuffer. The only thing better is to have Christopher Moore stuffed in the Christmas stocking with his novels.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35704076.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Christopher Moore</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Hawaii and San Francisco, California</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>August 05, 1958</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Toledo, Ohio</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Quill Award, Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror Book of the Year, for <I>The Stupidest Angel</I>, 2005 and <I>A Dirty Job</I>, 2006</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.chrismoore.com">* Christopher Moore's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p><i>A 100-year-old ex-seminarian and a demon set off together on a psychotic road trip... <p>  Christ's wisecracking childhood pal is brought back from the dead to chronicle the Messiah's "missing years"...<p> A mild-mannered thrift shop owner takes a job harvesting souls for the Grim Reaper...</i><p>  Whence come these wonderfully weird scenarios? From the fertile imagination of Christopher Moore, a cheerfully demented writer whose absurdist fiction has earned him comparisons to master satirists like Kurt Vonnegut, Terry Pratchett, and Douglas Adams.<p>     Ever since his ingenious debut, 1992's <i>Practical Demonkeeping</I>, Moore has attracted an avid cult following. But, over the years, as his stories have become more multi-dimensional and his characters more morally complex, his fan base has expanded to include legions of enthusiastic general readers and appreciative critics.<p>     Asked where his colorful characters come from, Moore points to his checkered job resume. Before becoming a writer, he worked at various times as a grocery clerk, an insurance broker, a waiter, a roofer, a photographer, and a DJ -- experiences he has  mined for a veritable rogue's gallery of unforgettable fictional creations. Moreover, to the delight of hardcore fans, characters from one novel often resurface in another. For example, the lovesick teen vampires introduced in 1995's <i>Bloodsucking Fiends</I> are revived (literally) for the 2007 sequel <i>You Suck</I> -- which also incorporates plot points from 2006's <i>A Dirty Job</I>.<p>      For a writer of satirical fantasy, Moore is a surprisingly scrupulous researcher. In pursuit of realistic details to ground his fiction, he has been known to immerse himself in marine biology, death rituals, Biblical scholarship, and Goth culture. He has been dubbed "the thinking man's Dave Barry" by none other than <i>The Onion</I>, a publication with a particular appreciation of smart humor.<p>     As for story ideas, Moore elaborates on his website: "Usually [they come] from something I read. It could be a single sentence in a magazine article that kicks off a whole book. Ideas are cheap and easy. Telling a good story once you get an idea is hard." Perhaps. But, to judge from his continued presence on the bestseller lists, Chris Moore appears to have mastered the art.</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>In researching his wild tales,</b> Moore has done everything from taking excursions to the South Pacific to diving with whales. So what is left for the author to tackle? He says he'd like to try riding an elephant. <P>    <b>One of the most memorably weird moments in Moore's body of work</b> is no fictional invention. The scene in <I>Bloodsucking Fiends</I>where the late-night crew of a grocery store bowls with frozen turkeys is based on Moore's own experiences bowling with frozen turkeys while working the late shift at a grocery store.<p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the winter of 2006, Christopher Moore took some time out to talk with us about some of his favorite books, authors, and interests:</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  <I>Cannery Row</I> by John Steinbeck. In <I>Cannery Row</I>, Steinbeck writes about very flawed people, but with great affection, and by doing so, shows us that it is our flaws that make us human, and that is what we share, that is our humanity. A friend of mine used to say, "He writes with the voice of a benevolent God." In the process, the book is also very funny. I think I saw that as a model, as a guide. I'd always written humor that was fairly edgy, but here was a guy writing with great power and gentle humor. I was moved and inspired. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Cannery Row</I> by John Steinbeck -- It's that amazing, benevolent, powerful, forgiving voice. <p>    <li><I>Sweet Thursday</I> by John Steinbeck -- Steinbeck again, great humanity and great humor. <p>    <li><I>Tortilla Flat</I> by John Steinbeck --This one has a great sense of the romance of the common man. The heroic potential we can realize by our acts, not necessarily our upbringing. <p>    <li><I>A Bell for Adano</I> by John Hersey -- This, too, has a great voice, a gentle ironic tone, and it shows the interconnectedness of a small town, something that use in my books again and again. <p>    <li><I>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</I> by Douglas Adams -- This book was just outright, laugh-out-loud funny. Wildly so. It did something I hadn't seen done before successfully: it made science fiction funny by recognizing the conventions and turning them on their ears. I tried to do the same thing for horror in my first book, <I>Practical Demonkeeping</I>. Whether I was successful or not, is another thing, but I was definitely inspired by Adams. <p>    <li><I>Galapagos</I> by Kurt Vonnegut -- I like all of Vonnegut's books, but I think this one showed how a single theme -- "our brains got too big" -- can be worked through a story for comic effect, and even to reveal the characters. I'm also a big fan of <I>Bluebeard</I>, because of how it discusses abstract expressionist painting, and comments on the impermanence and inherent irony in making art. Also, Vonnegut writes it in short pieces, which he says can be placed in any order and read and the book will still work. It's brilliant that way. <p>    <li><I>Jitterbug Perfume</I> by Tom Robbins -- I think that in this book, all of Robbins's talents coalesced. He always turns a great phrase, but here the great phrases add up to a great story, with great characters, and a great theme, spanning time and distance, theologies and philosophies, and celebrating the sensual with great joy, in the language and in the whole spirit of the book. I think it may be the most directed exercise in whimsy, or apparent whimsy that anyone has ever done. Definitely an inspiration for me, in that Robbins pulled off something that most people would never attempt. For me, that's where the joy and torture of being a writer comes to bear -- when you take on something and you have no idea whether you can pull it off or not. I don't know if Robbins felt that way about this book, but I think a lot of other people might have. <p>    <li><I>The Illustrated Man</I> by Ray Bradbury -- I discovered Ray Bradbury when I was 11 or 12, and I was already interested in telling stories -- or making stuff up, as I thought about it -- but reading Ray's short stories, I was aware for the first time that there was a craftsman behind the story. That I was being led toward an effect and that there was a craft that could probably be learned. It's very cool, I think, that Ray and I have the same editor now. <p>    <li><I>Shogun</I> by James Clavell -- This book may have had more impact on me because of the circumstances I was in when I read it. I was 19 and I had just moved to California from Ohio, all my belongings in the trunk of my car, and I didn't know a soul. For the first couple of weeks there, I escaped into medieval Japan, into Blackthorne's stranger in a strange land environment. I don't know how much this book influenced my writing, other than to say that it made me realize that a book can really transport you, shelter you. I walked samurai for weeks, if that makes any sense. When I finally took on a historical setting in <I>Lamb</I>, I tried to have patience with my characters, let them wander around in the book, realizing that if I did it right, the reader would be right there with them. <p>    <li><I>The Catcher in the Rye</I> by J. D. Salinger -- This is where you learn what satire is, where you learn about voice, where you learn about point of view. Holden Caufield is so confused, yet sees his world so clearly. His voice is so distinct. I think that any American who thinks about writing satire has to think about <I>The Catcher in the Rye</I>, and <I>Huckleberry Finn</I> too. Both books are distinctly American, and both establish characters that are essential members of American literature's pantheon. Holden and Huckleberry are in your blood if you're an American writer. <p>    <li><I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> by Ernest Hemingway -- I had to think about this one, because I think that Hemingway has ruined more young writers than any other writer, but it wasn't his style or his "awesome presence" that impressed me about this book, it's the economy of passion. It's the struggle, the conflict, all of it happening in a tiny boat, with a normal, working man. It's complete, and does everything a good story should do. <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</I> -- This movie, for me, may be just perfect. It's funny, the scenes are all beautifully timed, and the friendship between Butch and Sundance ties all the events together. Whenever I go past it, running on the classic movie channel, I stop, and think, "Okay, I'll watch it until the bicycle scene, or the cliff scene, or the knife fight scene," and before I know it, I've watched the whole thing, because every scene has something great about it. I'm chagrined that they are thinking about remaking this movie. When I wrote <I>Lamb</I>, I was thinking about the relationship between my main two characters in terms of Butch and Sundance, a rascal and an angel -� like Huck and Tom Sawyer. The friendship is archetypical. <p>      <li><I>Harvey</I>  -- I can watch <I>Harvey</I> a thousand times, listen to Jimmy Stewart talk about how nobody brings anything small into a bar, and I love it every time. It's about the truth and magic of lunatics, and it's so sweet, and again, so well timed. It's archetypical in my cultural literacy, as is <I>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</I>. It's a go-to reference for me: "How did they do it in <I>Harvey</I>?" <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I like rock 'n' roll, the Stones, Springsteen, U2, Foo Fighters, as well as singer-songwriters like Sheryl Crow, Aimee Mann, and John Hiatt, but I don't listen to any of those when I'm writing. When I'm writing I listen to acid jazz or ambient groove or chill music, stuff with a steady, jazzy beat, but no words. Bands like Baby Mammoth, Fila Brasilia, and Afterlife -- usually on Groove Salad, an Internet radio station. Sometimes I'll put on Gershwin or Bach if the mood strikes: I like <I>Rhapsody in Blue</I> and the <I>Brandenburg Concerto No. 3.</I> Seems like stuff should be happening when those songs are playing. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  <I>Sailing Around the Room Alone</I> by Billy Collins. It's a collection of poetry, spare and elegant and very, very funny. He catches the spirit of a moment as well as any Japanese haiku poet, yet he has a great sense of silliness and irony. Someone nearly forced me to read this book, putting it in my hand, physically, again and again, and I'm forever grateful. When I needed to think about Death and the importance of the moments of our lives and how to express them, Billy Collins inspires me. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I like getting art and photography books as gifts, because I normally wouldn't buy them for myself. I also like it when someone gives me a hardcover of a book I really love. Something to keep. It doesn't have to be a first edition or anything, just something I can read over and over again. On some occasions, I've been given books I completely didn't want, like Billy Collins, or Steve Kluger's <I>The Last Days of Summer</I>, only to be completely surprised and delighted. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  Everything, including my feet. Really. Right now I'm sitting in the middle of a nest of chaos. I have a big, L-shaped desk, and there's not a free inch of it. It would take two pages to list all the crap on my desk. (I know -- I've tried it.) Consistently, there's always a cup a coffee and a bottle of water there. <p>      <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I've been writing professionally for about 15 years now, and I make a pretty good living, which is, I suppose, what you're going for when you start this journey. When I was 16 I decided I wanted to write for a living, but since I didn't really believe I could make enough to live on, I went to college for photography. I got sidetracked for a few years, and then when I was 25 or so, I went to a writer's conference where people said that I was pretty good, that I ought to give it a whirl. <p>    I started getting serious right about then, and I quit my job as an insurance broker and moved to a town where it was cheaper to live and I could do work that didn't take much of my mental energy. I waited tables and such. It was eight years before I sold my first book. I didn't really go through a huge gauntlet of rejections. The challenge for me was developing the discipline to actually finish a book. After I finished my first book, it took about eleven months to sell it, but it didn't feel as if I was struggling. The writing was the hard part. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Do the work and keep doing the work. Send it out and keep sending it out. If you're writing stories that interest you and challenge you, then they will probably interest and challenge someone else, and the bottom line is, you'll get some satisfaction out of doing the work as well as getting the rewards for it. I don't think I had any success at writing until I gave up worry about being a success and just tried to write stories that I'd like to read. <p><h3>Feature Essay</h3>Moore also had this to share with his readers:<P>    <b>Getting a Life</b><br>  When you write books for a living, it doesn't take long to realize that if you don't do something, you're going to spend the bulk of your life in a room, alone, making clicky noises on a keyboard. I think I realized that early on, so I try to pick the subjects of my books so every other one gets me out there doing something. For <I>Island of the Sequined Love Nun</I>, I went to a small island in Micronesia and lived with the natives. (Way overrated, by the way, that "life on a tropical island." Chairs and hot showers are your friends.) <p>    My next book, <I>The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove</I>, would be set in the town I was living in, but I got to do research on psycho-pharmaceuticals, and since most of my friends were on anti-depressants, I got to go out to lunch with them a lot and ask them personal questions. The next book would be <I>Lamb</I>, which took me to Israel, and the first century, but most of the research was academic, so the next project was <I>Fluke</I>, where I lived around and worked with marine mammal biologists for two seasons in Maui. That was an amazing experience that actually culminated in being able to get in the water with singing humpbacks.<p>    So life kind of oscillates for me, from my office to the outside world, and the great thing is, now my readers write me and offer glimpses into their lives. Sometimes I take them up on it. When I needed to know how to steal a 747 for <I>Island of the Sequined Love Nun</I>, I contacted an airline pilot who loved my books. (It wasn't as sensitive back then as it is now.) There's always some cool thing to learn coming around the corner. <p>    <b>More Advice for Aspiring Writers</b><br>  It's funny how new writers will always ask you how to get an agent, but they hardly ever ask anything about the craft. I've written ten books, I know a lot about the craft. I've only ever gotten an agent once, and that was fifteen years ago, by a complete luck. I don't know anything about getting an agent. I don't think people realize that getting published is sort of like being born -- if you get it right, you only have to do it once. <p>    <b>Philosophy</b><br>  I pretty much believe that irony is the strongest force in the universe, and I think that someday, some scholar is going to be able to take all of my books and be able to prove that, by the clever application of mathematics, computer science, and advanced weaselocity. <p>    <b>Other Interests</b><br>  I like to scuba dive and ocean kayak. I'm not particularly good at those things, but they put me in touch with the ocean and my own mortality pretty quickly (particularly because I'm not very good at them). That's always an inspiration, because after I survive getting slammed against some rocks by a ten-foot wave, or hurling through my regulator underwater and watching colorful tropical fish eating my lunch chunks, I really appreciate getting back to my desk. I'm thankful that people will pay to read stuff I make up and I don't have to actually do anything to make a living. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>Christmas crept into Pine Cove like a creeping Christmas thing: dragging garland, ribbon, and sleigh bells, oozing eggnog, reeking of pine, and threatening festive doom like a cold sore under the mistletoe.<p>

'Twas the night (okay, more like the week) before Christmas, and all through the tiny community of Pine Cove, California, people are busy buying, wrapping, packing, and generally getting into the holiday spirit. It is the hap-hap-happiest time of the year, after all.<p>

But not everybody is feeling the joy. Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead.<p>

But hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say "Kris Kringle," he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.<p>

Only Christopher Moore, the man who brought you the outrageous lost gospel Lamb and the hysterical fish tale Fluke could have devised a new holiday classic that tugs at the heartstrings and serves up a healthy slice of fruitcake to boot.<p>

Move over, Charles Dickens&#151;it's Christopher Moore time.</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Janet Maslin</h3><p>While this book is not Mr. Moore's best or wildest, it is buoyant enough to look like his big, overdue breakout. Chalk that up to the confluence of fruit bat, Warrior Babe, handcuffs and merrily warped holiday spirit. And his earlier work has reached critical mass, to the point at which Mr. Moore is clearly the unhinged Hiaasen. He's "Daily Show"-funny and willing to subvert anything, even the "pile of dead Kringle" that sets this fractured fairy tale in motion.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Hilarity abounds in Moore's latest satirical gem. Sleepy Pine  Cove, Calif., is abuzz with Christmas spirit, but Lena Marquez  is fed up with her despicable ex-husband, Dale Pearson. On his  way home from playing Santa Claus at the local lodge, Dale spies  sneaky Lena uprooting his Monterey pines; he pulls a gun on her,  she lashes out with a shovel and-oops!-kills him. Seven-year-old  Josh Barker, thinking he's just seen the murder of Santa, prays  for a miracle to save Christmas. To Lena's rescue comes Tucker  Case, a slimy, reformed Casanova and DEA pilot, who gives her an  alibi and sweeps her off her feet. The marijuana-cultivating  town constable, Theo Crowe, suspects foul play, but Tucker  intervenes with a blackmail scheme to keep the crime buried.  Meanwhile, there's a new arrival in town: the glowingly blond  Archangel Raziel (last seen in Lamb) has come "dirtside" on a  "miracle mission" involving Josh's wish and reviving the town's  dearly departed. Pine Cove's biggest challenge surfaces as  comically reanimated zombies begin to rise and feast on the  living, and a huge El Ni o-induced storm swirls. This little  slice of perverse Christmas cheer is enough to make even the  most cynical Scrooge guffaw. Agent, Nicholas Ellison. (Oct.)  Forecast: Moore's reputation for quality satire and the book's  compact size should make hand-selling this as easy as pie.    Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information.

Pine Cove, sleepy California coastal village -- a toy town, really, with more art galleries than gas stations, more wine-tasting rooms than hardware stores -- lay there, as inviting as a drunken prom queen, as Christmas loomed, only five days away. Christmas was coming, and with Christmas this year, would come the Child. Both were vast and irresistible, and miraculous. Pine Cove was expecting only one of the two. <p>Which is not to say that the locals didn't get into the Christmas spirit. The two weeks before and after Christmas provided a welcome wave of cash into the town's coffers, tourist-starved since summer. Every waitress dusted off her Santa hat and clip-on reindeer antlers and checked to make sure that there were four good pens in her apron. Hotel clerks steeled themselves for the rage of last-minute overbookings, while housekeepers switched from their normal putrid baby-powder air fresheners to a more festive putrid pine and cinnamon. Down at the Pine Cove Boutique they put a "Holiday Special" sign on the hideous reindeer sweater and marked it up for the tenth consecutive year. The Elks,Moose, Masons, and VFWs, who were basically the same bunch of drunk old guys, planned furiously for their annual Christmas parade down Cypress Street, the theme of which this year would be Patriotism in the Bed of a Pickup (mainly because that had been the theme of their Fourth of July parade and everyone still had the decorations). Many Pine Covers even volunteered to man the Salvation Army kettles down in front of the post office and the Thrifty-Mart in two-hour shifts, sixteen hours a day. Dressed in their red suits and fake beards, they rang their bells like they were going for dog-spit gold at the Pavlov Olympics. <p>"Give up the cash, you cheap son of a bitch," said Lena Marquez, who was working the kettle that Monday, five days before Christmas. Lena was following Dale Pearson, Pine Cove's evil developer, through the parking lot, ringing the bejeezus out of him as he headed for his truck. On his way into the Thrifty-Mart, he'd nodded to her and said, "Catch you on the way out," but when he emerged eight minutes later, carrying a sack of groceries and a bag of ice, he blew by her kettle like she was using it to render tallow from building inspectors' butts and he needed to escape the stench. <p>"It's not like you can't afford a couple of bucks for the less fortunate." <p>She rang her bell especially hard right by his ear and he spun around, swinging the bag of ice at her about hip level. <p>Lena jumped back. She was thirty-eight, lean, darkskinned, with the delicate neck and finely set jawline of a flamenco dancer; her long black hair was coiled into two Princess Leia cinnabuns on either side of her Santa hat. "You can't take a swing at Santa! That's wrong in so many ways that I don't have time to enumerate them." <p>"You mean to <em>count</em> them," Dale said, the soft winter sunlight glinting off a new set of veneers he'd just had installed on his front teeth. He was fifty-two, almost completely bald, and had strong carpenter's shoulders that were still wide and square, despite the beer gut hanging below. <p>"I mean it's wrong -- you're wrong -- and you're cheap," and with that Lena put the bell next to his ear again and shook it like a red-suited terrier shaking the life out of a screaming brass rat. <p>Dale cringed at the sound and swung the ten-pound bag of ice in a great underhanded arc that caught Lena in the solar plexus and sent her backpedaling across the parking lot, gasping for breath. That's when the ladies at BULGES called the cops -- well, cop. <p>Bulges was a women's fitness center located just above the parking lot of the Thrifty-Mart, and from their treadmills and stair-climbing machines, the BULGES members could watch the ins and outs of the local market without feeling as if they were actively spying. So what had started as a moment of sheer glee and a mild adrenaline surge for the six of them who were watching as Lena chased Dale through the parking lot, turned quickly to shock as the evil developer thwacked the Latin Santa-ette in the breadbasket with a satchel of minicubes. Five of the six merely missed a step or gasped, but Georgia Bauman -- who had her treadmill cranked up to eight miles per hour at that very moment, because she was trying to lose fifteen pounds by Christmas and fit into a red-sequined sheath cocktail dress her husband had bought for her in a fit of sexual idealism -- bowled backward off her treadmill and landed in a colorful spandex tangle of yoga students who had been practicing on the mats behind her. <p>"Ow, my ass chakra!" <p>"That's you're root chakra." <p>"Feels like my ass." <p>"Did you see that? He nearly knocked her off her feet. Poor thing." <p>"Should we see if she's all right?" <p>"Someone should call Theo." <p>The exercisers opened their cell phones in unison, like the Jets flicking switchblades as they gaily danced into a <em>West Side Story</em> gang-fight to the death. <br> <br><i>Continues...</i></i></i></blockquote> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <i>The Stupidest Angel</i> by <i>Christopher Moore</i> Copyright &copy; 2005 by Christopher Moore.
