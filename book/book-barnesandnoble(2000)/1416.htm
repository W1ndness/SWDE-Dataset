</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Perri Klass</h3><p><i>Better</i> makes a compelling case for medical self-awareness in the operating room, on the hospital ward and even on the battlefield. Gawande succeeds in looking at medical achievement -- and lapses -- from a new perspective. His stories evoke the profound desire that doctors feel to cure, along with our besetting anxieties about poor performance and its consequences. He makes his case that failure is "so easy, so effortless," but also that "positive deviance" -- deliberate and determined individual improvement -- is possible. His own self-consciousness, his ability to ask questions about the nuts and bolts of medical practice, and his storytelling skills make this a book about the complex grandeur of the human endeavor that is medicine.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>A rock n� roll loving surgeon who writes for <I>The New Yorker</I>, Atul Gawande has a gift for describing both medical mishaps and awe-inspiring surgical techniques with authoritative ease.

											Atul Gawande's thoughtful, incisive work is always a pleasure to read, but perhaps never moreso than when readers can take his observations and apply them to their own lives.  'Better' will make you re-examine how you go about the practice of your own profession - whatever it is - and leave you striving to do it better.  If you have enjoyed Gawande's New Yorker pieces, you will be glad for the opportunity to enjoy a longer work, but know that it flies by quickly.  Plan on having 'Complications' or 'The Checklist Manifesto' nearby for when you finish, as you'll surely be left wanting more.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35703724.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Atul Gawande</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Newton, Massachusetts</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>November 05, 1965</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Brooklyn, New York</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.A.S., Stanford University, 1987; M.A., Oxford University, 1989; M.D., Harvard Medical School, 1995</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>Rhodes Scholarship, 1987</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>In his interview with Barnes & Noble.com</b>, Gawande described a shining memory: "I believe that one version of the good in life can be defined by the moments I sometimes had playing tennis as a sixteen-year-old," He recalled. "You�d be out on the court and for an hour, two hours, sometimes an entire roasting hot day, and every single thing you hit would go in. Hit that ball as hard as you wanted, wherever you wanted, and it went in. It was effortless power, achieved out of practice. But my game�s gone to hell. And I have not had a moment like that since high school."<p>         <b>A serious surgeon and writer by day</b>, Gawande has been known to rock out. He told Barnes & Noble.com, "I have always believed that there is nothing greater than a life in rock n' roll -- it has to be <I>good</I> rock n' roll -- and I still think it is true."<p>    <b>Gawande claims not to have any one source</b> of inspiration for his writing. I don�t write out of inspiration," he told us. "I write because it�s my way of finding cool ideas, thinking through hard problems and things I don�t understand, and getting better at something. I was never born to write. I was taught to write. And I am still being taught to write."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2002, Atul Gawande answered some of our questions.</I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life -- and why?</b> <br>    Lewis R. Thomas�s <I>The Lives of a Cell</I>, because it was beautiful and vivid and human and intensely curious about science and the world. And also because it put before me the notion that a person, even a physician, could find a place in public life writing and talking about science and human beings in their many dimensions. <p>     <b>What are your ten favorite books -- and why?</b><br>  <ul><p>  <li>Lewis R. Thomas�s <I>The Lives of a Cell</I> -- See above. <p>    <li>Ernest Hemingway's <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> -- One of the great novels of all time; my model of succinct, clear, and also morally inspired writing. And also, unexpectedly, some of the best observed writing on medicine there has been.<p>    <li>Ernest Hemingway's <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> -- It is the model of dramatic tension drawn out, description, and parable. <p>    <li>George Orwell's <I>Shooting an Elephant</I> -- OK, it�s not a book in itself, but it is one of, if not <I>the</I>, best essays written in the English language.<p>    <li>Oliver Sacks's <I>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</I> and Sherwin Nuland's <I>How We Die</I> -- Both, with Lewis Thomas, have been modern models to me of medical writing, humane concern, and inspired scientific curiosity.<p>    <li>Tom Wolfe's <I>The Right Stuff</i> -- Beautiful, alive, unputdownable human reportage. <p>    <li>Tobias Wolff's <I>This Boy�s Life</I> -- A memoir like no other I�ve read; it explores the invention -- and self-invention -- of who we are. I don�t live by it. But I wish I could.<p>    <li>Salman Rushdie's <I>The Satanic Verses</I> -- Everything I dislike about writing -- pompousness, knowing wordiness, literary posturing, characters as merely symbols, symbols as blaring neon signposts, tendentious politics -- put together into a single book of genius.

He makes his case that failure is "so easy, so effortless," but also that "positive deviance" -- deliberate and determined individual improvement -- is possible.

While fans of his work may be disappointed to find they've already read half of the chapters in <i>The New Yorker</i> (where Gawande is a staff writer) or elsewhere, Gawande's meditation on performance is not only an absorbing collection of essays on how some doctors manage to do better but also an exhilarating call for the rest of us to do the same.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Veteran character actor Lloyd does a commendable job in narrating Gawande's arresting expos&eacute; of the razor-thin margin that separates top doctors from the rest. While the book has its share of sensational and bloodcurdling tales of virulent infections and medicine gone wrong, Lloyd resists the urge to sensationalize his reading. He rightly senses that these tales do not constitute the heart of this book. Some parts are necessarily slow-moving and methodical, including a lecture on the proper way to scrub hands or a complex rundown of India's health care system. Lloyd's quietly authoritative reading lends an unhurried air that is appropriate for a book fundamentally about taking the time to care, and care diligently, about the things that matter most.

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Surgeon and MacArthur fellow Gawande applies his gift for dulcet prose to medical and ethical dilemmas in this collection of 12 original and previously published essays adapted from the New England Journal of Medicine and the New Yorker. If his 2002 collection, Complications, addressed the unfathomable intractability of the body, this is largely about how we erect barriers to seamless and thorough care. Doctors know they should wash their hands more often to avoid bacterial transfer in the ward, but once a minute does seem extreme. Using chaperones for breast exams seems a fine idea, but it does make situations awkward. "The social dimension turns out to be as essential as the scientific," Gawande writes-a conclusion that could serve as a thumbnail summary of his entire output. The heart of the book are the chapters "What Doctors Owe," about the U.S.'s blinkered malpractice system, and "Piecework," about what doctors earn. Cheerier, paradoxically, are the chapters involving polio and cystic fibrosis, featuring Dr. Pankaj Bhatnagar and Dr. Warren Warwick, two remarkable men who have been able to catapult their humanity into their work rather than constantly stumble over it. Indeed, one suspects that once we cure the ills of the health care system, we'll look back and see that Gawande's writings were part of the story. (Apr.) Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>Gawande, a Harvard-trained endocrine surgeon, contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i>, best-selling author (<i>Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science</i>), and 2006 MacArthur fellow, examines the nature of how success and excellence are achieved in medicine and how diligence, doing right, and ingenuity can combine to do better&mdash;in not only medicine but also all other human endeavors. In a narrative style reminiscent of Oliver Sacks, Sherwin B. Nuland, and Abraham Verghese, Gawande candidly weaves a tapestry of essays on topics as varied as hospital hand washing, polio in India, surgical tents in the Iraq war, physicians' salaries, malpractice insurance, and doctors' roles in lethal injections. The essays are united, as they highlight opportunities for improvement within the medical community, which serves as a successful framework for Gawande's study of a profession predicated on betterment. These revealing, humanistic essays are highly recommended for all libraries. Gawande's varied accomplishments have been publicized, and this book is certain to be a best seller [For a Q&amp;A with Gawande, see <i>LJ</i>3/15/07.--Ed.]</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>"What does it take to be good at something, when failure is so easy?" asks writer/physician Gawande in his follow-up to Complications (2002).

A similar rating scale for every medical encounter, he believes, would inform patients and improve the performance of doctors and hospitals. He lauds the innovative thinking of Don Berwick, head of the Institute for Health Care Improvement, who is challenging the medical profession to measure and compare the performance of doctors and hospitals and to give patients total access to that information. When such information is available, medical professionals can identify the best performance and learn from it, as Gawande illustrates with an account of exceptional results in treating cystic fibrosis at Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland. Monitoring and improving clinical performance would do more to save lives than advances in laboratory knowledge, he contends. Foryoung doctors wondering how they can make an individual difference, Gawande suggests five strategies: Ask unscripted questions, don't complain, "count something" (be a scientist as well as a doctor), write something (to make yourself part of a larger world) and change in response to new ideas. A must-read for medical professionals-and a discerning, humanizing portrait of doctors at work for the rest of us.

</div><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><p><B>Introduction</B><p><p>Several years ago, in my final year of medical school, I took care of a patient who has stuck in my mind. I was on an internal medicine rotation, my last rotation before graduating. The senior resident had assigned me primary responsibility for three or four patients. One was a wrinkled, seventy-something-year-old Portuguese woman who had been admitted because&#8212;I&#8217;ll use the technical term here&#8212;she didn&#8217;t feel too good. Her body ached. She had become tired all the time. She had a cough. She had no fever. Her pulse and blood pressure were fine. But some laboratory tests revealed her white blood cell count was abnormally high. A chest X-ray showed a possible pneumonia&#8212;maybe it was, maybe it wasn&#8217;t. So her internist admitted her to the hospital, and now she was under my care. I took sputum and blood cultures and, following the internist&#8217;s instructions, started her on an antibiotic for this possible pneumonia. I went to see her twice each day for the next several days. I checked her vital signs, listened to her lungs, looked up her labs. Each day, she stayed more or less the same. She had a cough. She had no fever. She just didn&#8217;t feel good. We&#8217;d give her antibiotics and wait her out, I figured. She&#8217;d be fine.<p><p>One morning on seven o&#8217;clock rounds, she complained of insomnia and having sweats overnight. We checked the vitals sheets. She still had no fever. Her blood pressure was normal. Her heart rate was running maybe slightly faster than before. But that was all. Keep a close eye on her, the senior resident told me. Of course, I said, though nothing we&#8217;d seen seemed remarkably differentfrom previous mornings. I made a silent plan to see her at midday, around lunchtime. The senior resident, however, went back to check on her himself twice that morning.<p><p>It is this little act that I have often thought about since. It was a small thing, a tiny act of conscientiousness. He had seen something about her that worried him. He had also taken the measure of me on morning rounds. And what he saw was a fourth-year student, with a residency spot already lined up in general surgery, on his last rotation of medical school. Did he trust me? No, he did not. So he checked on her himself.<p><p>That was not a two-second matter, either. She was up on the fourteenth floor of the hospital. Our morning teaching conferences, the cafeteria, all the other places we had to be that day were on the bottom two floors. The elevators were notoriously slow. The senior resident was supposed to run one of those teaching conferences. He could have waited for a nurse to let him know if a problem arose, as most doctors would. He could have told a junior resident to see the patient. But he didn&#8217;t. He made himself go up.<p><p>The first time he did, he found she had a fever of 102 degrees and needed the oxygen flow through her nasal prongs increased. The second time, he found her blood pressure had dropped and the nurses had switched her oxygen to a face mask, and he transferred her to the intensive care unit. By the time I had a clue about what was going on, he already had her under treatment&#8212;with new antibiotics, intravenous fluids, medications to support her blood pressure&#8212;for what was developing into septic shock from a resistant, fulminant pneumonia. Because he checked on her, she survived. Indeed, because he did, her course was beautiful. She never needed to be put on a ventilator. The fevers stopped in twenty-four hours. She got home in three days.<p><p><p>What does it take to be good at something in which failure is so easy, so effortless? When I was a student and then a resident, my deepest concern was to become competent. But what that senior resident had displayed that day was more than competence&#8212;he grasped not just how a pneumonia generally evolves and is properly treated but also the particulars of how to catch and fight one in that specific patient, in that specific moment, with the specific resources and people he had at hand.<p><p>People often look to great athletes for lessons about performance. And for a surgeon like me, athletes do indeed have lessons to teach&#8212;about the value of perseverance, of hard work and practice, of precision. But success in medicine has dimensions that cannot be found on a playing field. For one, lives are on the line. Our decisions and omissions are therefore moral in nature. We also face daunting expectations. In medicine, our task is to cope with illness and to enable every human being to lead a life as long and free of frailty as science will allow. The steps are often uncertain. The knowledge to be mastered is both vast and incomplete. Yet we are expected to act with swiftness and consistency, even when the task requires marshaling hundreds of people&#8212;from laboratory technicians to the nurses on each change of shift to the engineers who keep the oxygen supply system working&#8212;for the care of a single person. We are also expected to do our work humanely, with gentleness and concern. It&#8217;s not only the stakes but also the complexity of performance in medicine that makes it so interesting and, at the same time, so unsettling.<p><p>Recently, I took care of a patient with breast cancer. Virginia Magboo was sixty-four years old, an English teacher, and she&#8217;d noticed a pebblelike lump in her breast. A needle biopsy revealed the diagnosis. The cancer was small&#8212;three-quarters of an inch in diameter. She considered her options and decided on breast-conserving treatment&#8212;I&#8217;d do a wide excision of the lump as well as what&#8217;s called a sentinel lymph node biopsy to make sure the cancer hadn&#8217;t spread to the lymph nodes. Radiation would follow.<p><p>The operation was not going to be difficult or especially hazardous, but the team had to be meticulous about every step. On the day of surgery, before bringing her to the operating room, the anesthesiologist double-checked that it was safe to proceed. She reviewed Magboo&#8217;s medical history and medications, looked at her labs in the computer and at her EKG. She made sure that the patient had not had anything to eat for at least six hours and had her open her mouth to note any loose teeth that could fall out or dentures that should be removed. A nurse checked the patient&#8217;s name band to make sure we had the right person; verified her drug allergies with her, confirmed that the procedure listed on her consent form was the one she expected. The nurse also looked for contact lenses that shouldn&#8217;t be left in and for jewelry that could constrict a finger or snag on something. I made a mark with a felt-tip pen over the precise spot where Magboo felt the lump, so there would be no mistaking the correct location. Early in the morning before her surgery, she had also had a small amount of radioactive tracer injected near her breast lump, in preparation for the sentinel lymph node biopsy. I now used a handheld Geiger counter to locate where the tracer had flowed, and confirmed that the counts were strong enough to indicate which lymph node was the &#8220;hot&#8221; one that needed to be excised. Meanwhile, in the operating room, two nurses made sure the room had been thoroughly cleaned after the previous procedure and that we had all the equipment we needed. There is a sticker on the surgical instrument kit that turns brown if the kit has been heat-sterilized and they confirmed that the sticker had turned. A technician removed the electrocautery machine and replaced it with another one after a question was raised about how it was functioning. Everything was checked and cross-checked. Magboo and the team were

They  work in our hospital's infection-control unit. Their full-time  job, and that of three others in the unit, is to stop the spread of  infection in the hospital. This is not flashy work, and they are  not flashy people. Yokoe is forty-five years old, gentle voiced,  and dimpled. She wears sneakers at work. Marino is in her  fifties and reserved by nature. But they have coped with influenza  epidemics, Legionnaires' disease, fatal bacterial meningitis,  and, just a few months before, a case that, according to  the patient's brain-biopsy results, might have been Creutzfeld-Jakob  disease-a nightmare, not only because it is incurable  and fatal but also because the infectious agent that causes it,  known as a prion, cannot be killed by usual heat-sterilization  procedures. By the time the results came back, the neurosurgeon's  brain-biopsy instruments might have transferred the  disease to other patients, but infection-control team members  tracked the instruments down in time and had them chemically  sterilized. Yokoe and Marino have seen measles, theplague, and rabbit fever (which is caused by a bacterium that is  extraordinarily contagious in hospital laboratories and feared  as a bioterrorist weapon). They once instigated a nationwide  recall of frozen strawberries, having traced a hepatitis A outbreak  to a batch served at an ice cream social. Recently at large  in the hospital, they told me, have been a rotavirus, a Norwalk  virus, several strains of <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria, a superresistant  <i>Klebsiella</i>, and the ubiquitous scourges of modern hospitals-resistant  <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, which  are a frequent cause of pneumonias, wound infections, and  bloodstream infections.  <p>     Each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control,  two million Americans acquire an infection while they  are in the hospital. Ninety thousand die of that infection. The  hardest part of the infection-control team's job, Yokoe says, is  not coping with the variety of contagions they encounter or  the panic that sometimes occurs among patients and staff. Instead,  their greatest difficulty is getting clinicians like me to do  the one thing that consistently halts the spread of infections:  wash our hands.  <p>     There isn't much they haven't tried. Walking about the  surgical floors where I admit my patients, Yokoe and Marino  showed me the admonishing signs they have posted, the sinks  they have repositioned, the new ones they have installed. They  have made some sinks automated. They have bought special  five-thousand-dollar "precaution carts" that store everything  for washing up, gloving, and gowning in one ergonomic,  portable, and aesthetically pleasing package. They have given  away free movie tickets to the hospital units with the best  compliance. They have issued hygiene report cards. Yet still,  we have not mended our ways. Our hospital's statistics show  what studies everywhere else have shown-that we doctors  and nurses wash our hands one-third to one-half as often as  we are supposed to. Having shaken hands with a sniffling patient,  pulled a sticky dressing off someone's wound, pressed a  stethoscope against a sweating chest, most of us do little more  than wipe our hands on our white coats and move on-to see  the next patient, to scribble a note in the chart, to grab some  lunch.  <p>     This is, embarassingly, nothing new. In 1847, at the age of  twenty-eight, the Viennese obstetrician Ignac Semmelweis famously  deduced that, by not washing their hands consistently  or well enough, doctors were themselves to blame for  childbed fever. Childbed fever, also known as puerperal fever,  was the leading cause of maternal death in childbirth in the  era before antibiotics (and before the recognition that germs  are the agents of infectious disease). It is a bacterial infection-most  commonly caused by <i>Streptococcus</i>, the same bacteria that  causes strep throat-that ascends through the vagina to the  uterus after childbirth. Out of three thousand mothers who delivered  babies at the hospital where Semmelweis worked, six  hundred or more died of the disease each year-a horrifying  20 percent maternal death rate. Of mothers delivering at  home, only 1 percent died. Semmelweis concluded that doctors  themselves were carrying the disease between patients, and he  mandated that every doctor and nurse on his ward scrub with a  nail brush and chlorine between patients. The puerperal death  rate immediately fell to 1 percent-incontrovertible proof, it  would seem, that he was right. Yet elsewhere, doctors' practices  did not change. Some colleagues were even offended by  his claims; it was impossible to them that doctors could be  killing their patients. Far from being hailed, Semmelweis was  ultimately dismissed from his job.  <p>     Semmelweis's story has come down to us as Exhibit A in  the case for the obstinacy and blindness of physicians. But the  story was more complicated. The trouble was partly that  nineteenth-century physicians faced multiple, seemingly  equally powerful explanations for puerperal fever. There was,  for example, a strong belief that miasmas of the air in hospitals  were the cause. And Semmelweis strangely refused to either  publish an explanation of the logic behind his theory or  prove it with a convincing experiment in animals. Instead, he  took the calls for proof as a personal insult and attacked his detractors  viciously.  <p>     "You, Herr Professor, have been a partner in this massacre,"  he wrote to one University of Vienna obstetrician who  questioned his theory. To a colleague in Wurzburg he wrote,  "Should you, Herr Hofrath, without having disproved my  doctrine, continue to teach your pupils [against it], I declare  before God and the world that you are a murderer and the  'History of Childbed Fever' would not be unjust to you if it  memorialized you as a medical Nero." His own staff turned  against him. In Pest, where he relocated after losing his post in  Vienna, he would stand next to the sink and berate anyone  who forgot to scrub his or her hands. People began to purposely  evade, sometimes even sabotage, his hand-washing regimen.  Semmelweis was a genius, but he was also a lunatic, and  that made him a failed genius. It was another twenty years before  Joseph Lister offered his clearer, more persuasive, and  more respectful plea for antisepsis in surgery in the British  medical journal <i>Lancet</i>.  <p>     One hundred and forty years of doctors' plagues later,  however, you have to wonder whether what's needed to stop  them is precisely a lunatic. Consider what Yokoe and Marino  are up against. No part of human skin is spared from bacteria.  Bacterial counts on the hands range from five thousand to five  million colony-forming units per square centimeter. The hair,  underarms, and groin harbor greater concentrations. On the  hands, deep skin crevices trap 10 to 20 percent of the flora,  making removal difficult, even with scrubbing, and sterilization  impossible. The worst place is under the fingernails.  Hence the recent CDC guidelines requiring hospital personnel  to keep their nails trimmed to less than a quarter of an inch  and to remove artificial nails.  <p>     Plain soaps do, at best, a middling job of disinfecting.  Their detergents remove loose dirt and grime, but fifteen seconds  of washing reduces bacterial counts by only about an order  of magnitude. Semmelweis recognized that ordinary soap  was not enough and used a chlorine solution to achieve disinfection.  Today's antibacterial soaps contain chemicals such as  chlorhexidine to disrupt microbial membranes and proteins.  Even with the right soap, however, proper hand washing requires  a strict procedure. First, you must remove your watch,  rings, and other jewelry (which are notorious for trapping bacteria).  Next, you wet your hands in warm tap water. Dispense  the soap and lather all surfaces, including the lower one-third  of the arms, for the full duration recommended by the manufacturer  (usually fifteen to thirty seconds). Rinse off for thirty  full seconds. Dry completely with a clean, disposable towel.  Then use the towel to turn the tap off. Repeat after any new  contact with a patient.  <p>     Almost no one adheres to this procedure. It seems impossible.  On morning rounds, our residents check in on  twenty patients in an hour. The nurses in our intensive care  units typically have a similar number of contacts with patients  requiring hand washing in between. Even if you get the whole  cleansing process down to a minute per patient, that's still a  third of staff time spent just washing hands. Such frequent  hand washing can also irritate the skin, which can produce a  dermatitis, which itself increases bacterial counts.  <p>     Less irritating than soap, alcohol rinses and gels have  been in use in Europe for almost two decades but for some  reason only recently caught on in the United States. They take  far less time to use-only about fifteen seconds or so to rub a  gel over the hands and fingers and let it air-dry. Dispensers can  be put at the bedside more easily than a sink. And at alcohol  concentrations of 50 to 95 percent, they are more effective at  killing organisms, too. (Interestingly, pure alcohol is not as  effective-at least some water is required to denature microbial  proteins.)  <p>     Still, it took Yokoe over a year to get our staff to accept  the 60 percent alcohol gel we have recently adopted. Its introduction  was first blocked because of the staff's fears that it  would produce noxious building air. (It didn't.) Next came  worries that, despite evidence to the contrary, it would be  more irritating to the skin. So a product with aloe was  brought in. People complained about the smell. So the aloe  was taken out. Then some of the nursing staff refused to use  the gel after rumors spread that it would reduce fertility. The  rumors died only after the infection-control unit circulated evidence  that the alcohol is not systemically absorbed and a hospital  fertility specialist endorsed the use of the gel.  <p>     With the gel finally in wide use, the compliance rates for  proper hand hygiene improved substantially: from around 40  percent to 70 percent. But-and this is the troubling finding-hospital  infection rates did not drop one iota. Our 70 percent  compliance just wasn't good enough. If 30 percent of the time  people didn't wash their hands, that still left plenty of opportunity  to keep transmitting infections, indeed, the rates of resistant  <i>Staphylococcus</i> and <i>Enterococcus</i> infections continued to  rise. Yokoe receives the daily tabulations. I checked with her  one day not long ago, and sixty-three of our seven hundred  hospital patients were colonized or infected with MRSA (the  shorthand for methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>) and  another twenty-two had acquired VRE (vancomycin-resistant  <i>Enterococcus</i>)-unfortunately, typical rates of infection for  American hospitals.  <p>     Rising infection rates from superresistant bacteria have  become the norm around the world. The first outbreak of  VRE did not occur until 1988, when a renal dialysis unit in England  became infested. By 1990, the bacteria had been carried  abroad, and four in one thousand American ICU patients had  become infected. By 1997, a stunning 23 percent of ICU patients   were infected. When the virus for SARS-severe acute  respiratory syndrome-appeared in China in 2003 and spread  within weeks to almost ten thousand people in two dozen  countries across the world (10 percent of whom were killed),  the primary vector for transmission was the hands of health  care workers. What will happen if (or rather, when) an even  more dangerous organism appears-avian flu, say, or a new,  more virulent bacteria? "It will be a disaster," Yokoe says.  <p>     Anything short of a Semmelweis-like obsession with  hand washing has begun to seem inadequate. Yokoe, Marino,  and their colleagues have now resorted to doing random spot  checks on the floors. On a surgical intensive care unit, they  showed me what they do. They walk in unannounced. They  go directly into patients' rooms. They check for unattended  spills, toilets that have not been cleaned, faucets that drip,  empty gel dispensers, overflowing needle boxes, inadequate  supplies of gloves and gowns. They check whether the nurses  are wearing gloves when they handle patients' wound dressings  and catheters, which are ready portals for infection. And  of course, they watch to see whether everyone is washing up  before patient contact. Neither hesitates to confront people,  though they try to be gentle about it. ("Did you forget to gel  your hands?" is a favored line.) Staff members have come to  recognize them. I watched a gloved and gowned nurse come  out of a patient's room, pick up the patient's chart (which is  not supposed to be touched by dirty hands), see Marino, and  immediately stop short. "I didn't touch anything in the room!  I'm clean!" she blurted out.  <p>     Yokoe and Marino hate this aspect of the job. They don't  want to be infection cops. It's no fun, and it's not necessarily  effective, either. With twelve patient floors and four different  patient pods per floor, they can't stand watch the way Semmelweis  did, scowling over the lone sink on his unit. And they  risk having the staff revolt as his staff did against him. But  what other options remain? I flipped through back issues of  the <i>Journal of Hospital Infection and Infection Control and Hospital  Epidemiology</i>, two leading journals in the field, and the articles  are a sad litany of failed experiments to change our contaminating  ways. The great hoped-for solution has been a soap or a  hand rinse that would keep skin disinfected for hours and  make it easy for all of us to be good. But none has been found.  The situation has prompted one expert to propose-only half  jokingly-that the best approach may be to give up on hand  washing and get people to stop touching patients altogether.  <p>     We always hope for the easy fix: the one simple change  that will erase a problem in a stroke. But few things in life  work this way. Instead, success requires making a hundred  small steps go right-one after the other, no slipups, no goofs,  everyone pitching in. We are used to thinking of doctoring as  a solitary, intellectual task. But making medicine go right is  less often like making a difficult diagnosis than like making  sure everyone washes their hands.  <p>     It is striking to consider how different the history of the  operating room after Lister has been from that of the hospital  floor after Semmelweis. In the operating room, no one pretends  that even 90 percent compliance with scrubbing is good  enough. If a single doctor or nurse fails to wash up before  coming to the operating table, we are horrified-and certainly  not shocked if the patient develops an infection a few days later.  Since Lister we have gone even further in our expectations.  We now make sure to use sterile gloves and gowns, masks  over our mouths, caps over our hair. We apply antiseptics to  the patient's skin and lay down sterile drapes. We put our instruments  through steam heat sterilizers or, if any are too delicate  to tolerate the autoclave, through chemical sterilizers.  We have reinvented almost every detail of the operating room  for the sake of antisepsis. We have gone so far as to add an extra  person to the team, known as the circulating nurse, whose  central job is, essentially, to keep the team antiseptic. Every  time an unanticipated instrument is needed for a patient, the  team can't stand around waiting for one member to break  scrub, pull the thing off a shelf, wash up, and return. So the  circulator was invented. Circulators get the extra sponges and  instruments, handle the telephone calls, do the paperwork, get  help when it's needed. And every time they do, they're not just  making the case go more smoothly. They are keeping the patient  uninfected. By their very existence, they make sterility a  priority in every case.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Better</b> by <b>Atul Gawande</b>  Copyright &copy 2007   by Atul Gawande.
