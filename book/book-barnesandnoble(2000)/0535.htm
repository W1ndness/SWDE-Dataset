												Jonathan Yardley</h3><p>What Madame thinks she sees will not be revealed for many pages, but it gets right to the essence of this quite wonderful novel, the best Ishiguro has written since the sublime <i>The Remains of the Day</i>. It is almost literally a novel about humanity: what constitutes it, what it means, how it can be honored or denied. These little children, and the adults they eventually become, are brought up to serve humanity in the most astonishing and selfless ways, and the humanity they achieve in so doing makes us realize that in a new world the word must be redefined. Ishiguro pulls the reader along to that understanding at a steady, insistent pace. If the guardians at Hailsham "timed very carefully and deliberately everything they told us, so that we were always just too young to understand properly the latest piece of information," by the same token Ishiguro carefully and deliberately unfolds Hailsham's secrets one by one, piece by piece, as if he were slowly peeling an artichoke.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p><P><b>Kazuo Ishiguro</b> was born in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1954 and now lives in London, England.

											This is an interesting and thought provoking story.  What would it be like to be in the position of people in this book?  How should they be treated?  How would you deal with their situation?  It is pretty interesting.  You get so connected with the characters, you know how they are feeling about the situation, and it is powerful.  Probably great for a book club or even if you know other people who will read it so you can discuss it.  <p/><p/>However, putting the human face on these students also means that over half the book is just stories about their childhood - a seemingly rambling collection of vignettes of unexciting things that happened to teenagers.  I see the purpose and value behind it, and know that it was necessary for the powerful feeling that I got at the end of the book, but at the time, I felt bored that I was spending my time reading about teenagers drawing things and riding imaginary horses.<p/><p/>In the end, I am glad that I read it, and it will stay with me.  But if considering this book, you should know what it will take to get there.<p/><p/>Also, the eBook version had random numbers sometimes between paragraphs in the middle of chapters.  These were at break points, so they were not necessarily distracting, but they did not seem to have an order or reason.  (Granted I did not put much time into looking at them, as I was busy reading and it is tough to flip back and forth on the nook.)</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Great Read!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=fL0ssi3">fL0ssi3</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1385381_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781400078776_BK_24_1385381" href="#previewReview_1385381" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 14, 2010: 
											This book was an absolutely devastating read. I knew after the first or second chapter exactly what the &quot;reveal&quot; was, but it isn't a story meant to conclude when you learn what happens behind the curtain.<p/>It also isn't science fiction, which, upon learning the substance of what challenges the characters, one would assume it to be. It's hard to pigeon-hole it as anything definite - neither political, dramatic, etc; it seems, instead, to explore a number of themes. The story itself has a life and no life can really be explained away as being mono-thematic.<p/>I was particularly disturbed after finishing the book, having never felt such sadness and loss after reading something. It was a loss that seemed irreconcilable and irredeemable, and I didn't know quite how to feel about it. I had a lot of questions that I felt were purposely ignored, that bothered me throughout the book, and yet that didn't seem to ruin the story for me. I think the question that will pop up for whomever decides to read this - where is the survival instinct? how are these people so expressive in their humanity, and yet without the will to escape? - is meant to leave you feeling the way you do, as you can assume it probably leaves the characters you are reading about feeling the very same way. There is the question of nature versus nurture (are we born believing we possess certain rights innately? or is this something we are taught? are we born to believe we must strive to live on and on, even if someone tells you that is not the case, from the very moment you are born?) and the question, cliched as it seems, of what it means to be human, but more importantly, what it means to live, what is a life, what events define it, what must occur for one to definitively say &quot;I have lived a life in full.&quot;</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>One of Kazuo Ishiguro's greatest novelistic skills is his restraint. A writer who never reveals more than we need to know, he doles out details in small, carefully rationed increments, like delicacies too rich to squander -- leaving readers craving more. Nowhere is this skill more apparent than in this dark, dystopian tale of three former friends, all alumni of a British boarding school, who unravel a horrifying secret about their alma mater. We find it utterly compelling.</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><p>From the acclaimed author of <i>The Remains of the Day</i> and <i>When We Were Orphans</i>, a moving new novel that subtly reimagines our world and time in a haunting story of friendship and love.</p>

<p>As a child, Kathy-now thirty-one years old-lived at Hailsham, a private school in the scenic English countryside where the children were sheltered from the outside world, brought up to believe that they were special and that their well-being was crucial not only for themselves but for the society they would eventually enter. Kathy had long ago put this idyllic past behind her, but when two of her Hailsham friends come back into her life, she stops resisting the pull of memory.</P>

<p>And so, as her friendship with Ruth is rekindled, and as the feelings that long ago fueled her adolescent crush on Tommy begin to deepen into love, Kathy recalls their years at Hailsham. She describes happy scenes of boys and girls growing up together, unperturbed-even comforted-by their isolation. But she describes other scenes as well: of discord and misunderstanding that hint at a dark secret behind Hailsham�s nurturing facade. With the dawning clarity of hindsight, the three friends are compelled to face the truth about their childhood-and about their lives now.</p>

<p>A tale of deceptive simplicity, Never <i>Let Me Go</i> slowly reveals an extraordinary emotional depth and resonance-and takes its place among Kazuo Ishiguro�s finest work.</p></p><h3>The Washington Post -

These little children, and the adults they eventually become, are brought up to serve humanity in the most astonishing and selfless ways, and the humanity they achieve in so doing makes us realize that in a new world the word must be redefined. Ishiguro pulls the reader along to that understanding at a steady, insistent pace. If the guardians at Hailsham "timed very carefully and deliberately everything they told us, so that we were always just too young to understand properly the latest piece of information," by the same token Ishiguro carefully and deliberately unfolds Hailsham's secrets one by one, piece by piece, as if he were slowly peeling an artichoke.</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Michiko Kakutani</h3><p>In this novel, Mr. Ishiguro has set aside the windy Kafkaesque pretensions of his last two books to tell a tight, deftly controlled story. Though the grisly material he's dealing with is light years removed from that in <i>The Remains of the Day,</i> the resulting novel is just as accomplished and, in a very different way, just as melancholy and alarming.</p><h3>The New York Times Sunday Book Review - 
								Sarah Kerr</h3><p>There is no way around revealing the premise of Kazuo Ishiguro's new novel. It is brutal, especially for a writer celebrated as a poet of the unspoken. But it takes a while for us to get a handle on it. Since it's the nature of Ishiguro narrators to postpone a full reckoning of their place in the world, all we know in the early going is that we don't quite know what's going on.</p><h3>Sarah Howard

								KLIATT</h3><p>Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy grow up together as children at exclusive Hailsham, a remote boarding school secluded in the English countryside. Hailsham is a place of rigid and mysterious rules, and teachers constantly remind their charges just how special they are. Still, Hailsham will come to be regarded fondly by them, a haven that they will only later appreciate. Now, years later, Ruth and Tommy are drastically weakened by organ donation surgeries, and are ultimately waiting to "complete." While caring for the two at different British centres, a grown-up Kathy only now begins to understand what makes the three of them so special, and how it has determined the courses of their lives. Melancholy, suspenseful, and at times alarming, this novel is a compellingly dark page-turner. As Ishiguro slowly and carefully unveils the truth about Hailsham, he reveals the dark underbelly of a post-war society prepared to take any measures, no matter how extreme, in order to vanquish its own loss and suffering. Ishiguro succeeds in building suspense and then deftly reveals only snatches of meaning in carefully controlled increments. Never Let Me Go is an eerie novel about the potential future relationship between modern science and Western society--and the conflicting consequences.  KLIATT Codes: SA--Recommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2005, Random House, Vintage International, 288p., $14.00.. Ages 15 to adult.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Ishiguro's previous novels, including the  Booker Prize winning The Remains of the Day and A Pale View of  the Hills, have been exquisite studies of microcosmic worlds  whose inhabitants struggle with loss and love, despair and hope.  Above all, his characters strive to forge an enduring  self-identity that can withstand the blows of an uncaring world.  His new novel centers on one such character, Kathy H., and her  attempts not only to find herself but also to understand her  role in a mysterious world whose meanings she often fails to  comprehend. As a child, Kathy H. attended Hailsham, a private  preparatory school whose teachers and guardians sheltered the  students from reality. Now 31, Kathy has assumed the position  for which she was trained at Hailsham so long ago, and she has  put the memories of her Hailsham days out of her mind. When she  is thrown together with two of her old school friends, she  begins to relive experiences that both call into question her  friendships and deepen them. Her memories reveal also that the  pastoral and pleasant Hailsham harbored dark and mysterious  secrets that she now can begin to understand. Ishiguro's elegant  prose and masterly ways with characterization make for a lovely  tale of memory, self-understanding, and love. [See Prepub Alert,  LJ 9/1/04.]-Henry L.

</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p>Adult/High School-The elegance of Ishiguro's prose and the  pitch-perfect voice of his narrator conspire to usher readers  convincingly into the remembered world of Hailsham, a British  boarding school for "special students." The reminiscence is told  from the point of view of Kathy H., now 31, whose evocation of  the sheltered estate's sunlit rolling hills, guardians,  dormitories, and sports pavilions is imbued with undercurrents  of muted tension and foreboding that presage a darker reality.  As an adult, Kathy re-engages in lapsed friendships with  classmates Ruth and Tommy, examining the details of their shared  youth and revisiting with growing awareness the clues and  anecdotal evidence apparent to them even as youngsters that they  were "different" from everyone outside. Ultimately, readers  learn that the Hailsham children are clones, raised solely for  the purpose of medical harvesting of organs, their lifespan  circumscribed by years when they are designated as carers,  followed by a short period as active donors, culminating in what  is obliquely referred to as "completion." The recovery centers  where Kathy serves as a carer for Ruth and then Tommy provide  the setting for the latter half of the novel, defining the  distinct rhythms and tenor of their days much as Hailsham did  when they were young. Ishiguro conveys with exquisite  sensitivity the emotional texture of the threesome's  relationship, their bonds of personal loyalty that overcome  fractures of trust, the palpable boundaries of hope, and the  human capacity for forgiveness. Highly recommended for literary  merit and as an exceptional platform for the discussion of a  controversial topic.-Lynn Nutwell, Fairfax City Regional  Library, VA   Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>An ambitious scientific experiment wreaks horrendous toll in the Booker-winning British author's disturbingly eloquent sixth novel (after When We Were Orphans, 2000). Ishiguro's narrator, identified only as Kath(y) H., speaks to us as a 31-year-old social worker of sorts, who's completing her tenure as a "carer," prior to becoming herself one of the "donors" whom she visits at various "recovery centers." The setting is "England, late 1990s"-more than two decades after Kath was raised at a rural private school (Hailsham) whose students, all children of unspecified parentage, were sheltered, encouraged to develop their intellectual and especially artistic capabilities, and groomed to become donors. Visions of Brave New World and 1984 arise as Kath recalls in gradually and increasingly harrowing detail her friendships with fellow students Ruth and Tommy (the latter a sweet, though distractible boy prone to irrational temper tantrums), their "graduation" from Hailsham and years of comparative independence at a remote halfway house (the Cottages), the painful outcome of Ruth's breakup with Tommy (whom Kath also loves), and the discovery the adult Kath and Tommy make when (while seeking a "deferral" from carer or donor status) they seek out Hailsham's chastened "guardians" and receive confirmation of the limits long since placed on them. With perfect pacing and infinite subtlety, Ishiguro reveals exactly as much as we need to know about how efforts to regulate the future through genetic engineering create, control, then emotionlessly destroy very real, very human lives-without ever showing us the faces of the culpable, who have "tried to convince themselves. . . . That you were less than human,so it didn't matter." That this stunningly brilliant fiction echoes Caryl Churchill's superb play A Number and Margaret Atwood's celebrated dystopian novels in no way diminishes its originality and power. A masterpiece of craftsmanship that offers an unparalleled emotional experience. Send a copy to the Swedish Academy. First printing of 100,000; author tour.

Kathy introduces herself as an experienced carer. She prides herself on knowing how to keep her donors calm, &#8220;even before fourth donation&#8221; [p. 3]. How long does it take for the meaning of such terms as &#8220;donation,&#8221; &#8220;carer,&#8221; and &#8220;completed&#8221; to be fully revealed?<P>2. Kathy addresses us directly, with statements like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it was where you were, but at Hailsham we used to have some form of medical every week&#8221; [p. 13], and she thinks that we too might envy her having been at Hailsham [p. 4]. What does Kathy assume about anyone she might be addressing, and why?<P>3. Why is it important for Kathy to seek out donors who are &#8220;from the past,&#8221; &#8220;people from Hailsham&#8221; [p. 5]? She learns from a donor who&#8217;d grown up at an awful place in Dorset that she and her friends at Hailsham had been really &#8220;lucky&#8221; [p. 6]. How does the irony of this designation grow as the novel goes on? What does Hailsham represent for Kathy, and why does she say at the end that Hailsham is &#8220;something no one can take away&#8221; [p. 287]?<P>4. Kathy tells the reader, &#8220;How you were regarded at Hailsham, how much you were liked and respected, had to do with how good you were at &#8216;creating&#8217;&#8221; [p. 16]. What were Hailsham&#8217;s administrators trying to achieve in attaching a high value to creativity?<P>5. Kathy&#8217;s narration is the key to the novel&#8217;s disquieting effect. First person narration establishes a kind of intimacy between narrator and reader. What is it like having direct access to Kathy&#8217;s mind and feelings? How would the novel be different if narrated from Tommy&#8217;s point of view, or Ruth&#8217;s, or Miss Emily&#8217;s?<P>6. What are some of Ruth&#8217;s most striking character traits? How might her social behavior, at Hailsham and later at the Cottages, be explained? Why does she seek her &#8220;possible&#8221; so earnestly [pp. 159&#8211;67]?<P>7. One of the most notable aspects of life at Hailsham is the power of the group. Students watch each other carefully and try on different poses, attitudes, and ways of speaking. Is this behavior typical of most adolescents, or is there something different about the way the students at Hailsham seek to conform?<P>8. How do Madame and Miss Emily react to Kathy and Tommy when they come to request a deferral? Defending her work at Hailsham, Miss Emily says, &#8220;Look at you both now! You&#8217;ve had good lives, you&#8217;re educated and cultured&#8221; [p. 261]. What is revealed in this extended conversation, and how do these revelations affect your experience of the story?<P>9. Why does Tommy draw animals? Why does he continue to work on them even after he learns that there will be no deferral?<P>10. Kathy reminds Madame of the scene in which Madame watched her dancing to a song on her Judy Bridgewater tape. How is Kathy&#8217;s interpretation of this event different from Madame&#8217;s? How else might it be interpreted? Is the song&#8217;s title again recalled by the book&#8217;s final pages [pp. 286&#8211;88]?<P>11. After their visit to Miss Emily and Madame, Kathy tells Tommy that his fits of rage might be explained by the fact that &#8220;at some level you always knew&#8221; [p. 275]. Does this imply that Kathy didn&#8217;t? Does it imply that Tommy is more perceptive than Kathy?<P>12. Does the novel examine the possibility of human cloning as a legitimate question for medical ethics, or does it demonstrate that the human costs of cloning are morally repellent, and therefore impossible for science to pursue? What kind of moral and emotional responses does the novel provoke? If you extend the scope of the book&#8217;s critique, what are its implications for our own society?<P>13. The novel takes place in &#8220;the late 1990s,&#8221; and a postwar science boom has resulted in human cloning and the surgical harvesting of organs to cure cancer and other diseases. In an interview with January Magazine Ishiguro said that he is not interested in realism.* In spite of the novel&#8217;s fictitious premise, however, how &#8220;realistically&#8221; does <b>Never Let Me Go</b> reflect the world we live in, where scientific advancement can be seemingly irresistible?<P>14. The teacher Lucy Wainright wanted to make the children more aware of the future that awaited them. Miss Emily believed that in hiding the truth, &#8220;We were able to give you something, something which even now no one will ever take from you, and we were able to do that principally by sheltering you. . . . Sometimes that meant we kept things from you, lied to you. . . . But . . . we gave you your childhoods&#8221; [p. 268]. In the context of the story as a whole, is this a valid argument?<P>15. Is it surprising that Miss Emily admits feeling revulsion for the children at Hailsham? Does this indicate that she believes Kathy and Tommy are not fully human? What is the nature of the moral quandary Miss Emily and Madame have gotten themselves into?<P>16. Critic Frank Kermode has noted that &#8220;Ishiguro is fundamentally a tragic novelist; there is always a disaster, remote but urgent, imagined but real, at the heart of his stories&#8221; [<i>London Review of Books</i>, April 21, 2005]. How would you describe the tragedy at the heart of <b>Never Let Me Go</b>?<P>17. Some reviewers have expressed surprise that Kathy, Tommy, and their friends never try to escape their ultimate fate. They cling to the possibility of deferral, but never attempt to vanish into the world of freedom that they view from a distance. Yet they love the film <i>The Great Escape</i>, &#8220;the moment the American jumps over the barbed wire on his bike&#8221; [p. 99]. Why might Ishiguro have chosen to present them as fully resigned to their early deaths?<P>18. Reread the novel&#8217;s final paragraph, in which Kathy describes a flat, windswept field with a barbed wire fence &#8220;where all sorts of rubbish had caught and tangled.&#8221; She imagines Tommy appearing here in &#8220;the spot where everything I&#8217;d ever lost since my childhood had washed up&#8221; [p. 287]. What does the final sentence indicate about Kathy&#8217;s state of mind as she faces her losses and her own death &#8212; stoicism, denial, courage, resolution?<P>19. In a recent interview, Ishiguro talked about <b>Never Let Me Go</b>&#58; &#8220;There are things I am more interested in than the clone thing. How are they trying to find their place in the world and make sense of their lives? To what extent can they transcend their fate? As time starts to run out, what are the things that really matter? Most of the things that concern them concern us all, but with them it is concertinaed into this relatively short period of time. These are things that really interest me and, having come to the realization that I probably have limited opportunities to explore these things, that&#8217;s what I want to concentrate on. I can see the appeal of travel books and journalism and all the rest of it and I hope there will be time to do them all one day. But I just don&#8217;t think that day is now.&#8221; How do these remarks relate to your own ideas about the book? [Interview with Nicholas Wroe, <i>The Guardian</i>, February 2, 2005.]<P><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P>My name is Kathy H. I'm thirty-one years old, and I've been a carer now for 
over eleven years. That sounds long enough, I know, but actually they want me to 
go on for another eight months, until the end of this year. That'll make it 
almost exactly twelve years. Now I know my being a carer so long isn't 
necessarily because they think I'm fantastic at what I do. There are some really 
good carers who've been told to stop after just two or three years. And I can 
think of one carer at least who went on for all of fourteen years despite being 
a complete waste of space. So I'm not trying to boast. But then I do know for a 
fact they've been pleased with my work, and by and large, I have too. My donors 
have always tended to do much better than expected. Their recovery times have 
been impressive, and hardly any of them have been classified as "agitated," even 
before fourth donation. Okay, maybe I am boasting now. But it means a lot to me, 
being able to do my work well, especially that bit about my donors staying 
"calm." I've developed a kind of instinct around donors. I know when to hang 
around and comfort them, when to leave them to themselves; when to listen to 
everything they have to say, and when just to shrug and tell them to snap out of 
it.</P>
<P>Anyway, I'm not making any big claims for myself. I know carers, working now, 
who are just as good and don't get half the credit. If you're one of them, I can 
understand how you might get resentful-about my bedsit, my car, above all, the 
way I get to pick and choose who I look after. And I'm a Hailsham student-which 
is enough by itself sometimes to get people's backs up. Kathy H., they say, she 
gets to pick and choose, and she always chooses her own kind: people from 
Hailsham, or one of the other privileged estates. No wonder she has a great 
record. I've heard it said enough, so I'm sure you've heard it plenty more, and 
maybe there's something in it. But I'm not the first to be allowed to pick and 
choose, and I doubt if I'll be the last. And anyway, I've done my share of 
looking after donors brought up in every kind of place. By the time I finish, 
remember, I'll have done twelve years of this, and it's only for the last six 
they've let me choose.</P>
<P>And why shouldn't they? Carers aren't machines. You try and do your best for 
every donor, but in the end, it wears you down. You don't have unlimited 
patience and energy. So when you get a chance to choose, of course, you choose 
your own kind. That's natural. There's no way I could have gone on for as long 
as I have if I'd stopped feeling for my donors every step of the way. And 
anyway, if I'd never started choosing, how would I ever have got close again to 
Ruth and Tommy after all those years?</P>
<P>But these days, of course, there are fewer and fewer donors left who I 
remember, and so in practice, I haven't been choosing that much. As I say, the 
work gets a lot harder when you don't have that deeper link with the donor, and 
though I'll miss being a carer, it feels just about right to be finishing at 
last come the end of the year.</P>
<P>Ruth, incidentally, was only the third or fourth donor I got to choose. She 
already had a carer assigned to her at the time, and I remember it taking a bit 
of nerve on my part. But in the end I managed it, and the instant I saw her 
again, at that recovery centre in Dover, all our differences-while they didn't 
exactly vanish-seemed not nearly as important as all the other things: like the 
fact that we'd grown up together at Hailsham, the fact that we knew and 
remembered things no one else did. It's ever since then, I suppose, I started 
seeking out for my donors people from the past, and whenever I could, people 
from Hailsham.</P>
<P>There have been times over the years when I've tried to leave Hailsham 
behind, when I've told myself I shouldn't look back so much. But then there came 
a point when I just stopped resisting. It had to do with this particular donor I 
had once, in my third year as a carer; it was his reaction when I mentioned I 
was from Hailsham. He'd just come through his third donation, it hadn't gone 
well, and he must have known he wasn't going to make it. He could hardly 
breathe, but he looked towards me and said: "Hailsham. I bet that was a 
beautiful place." Then the next morning, when I was making conversation to keep 
his mind off it all, and I asked where he'd grown up, he mentioned some place in 
Dorset and his face beneath the blotches went into a completely new kind of 
grimace. And I realised then how desperately he didn't want reminded. Instead, 
he wanted to hear about Hailsham.</P>
<P>So over the next five or six days, I told him whatever he wanted to know, and 
he'd lie there, all hooked up, a gentle smile breaking through. He'd ask me 
about the big things and the little things. About our guardians, about how we 
each had our own collection chests under our beds, the football, the rounders, 
the little path that took you all round the outside of the main house, round all 
its nooks and crannies, the duck pond, the food, the view from the Art Room over 
the fields on a foggy morning. Sometimes he'd make me say things over and over; 
things I'd told him only the day before, he'd ask about like I'd never told him. 
"Did you have a sports pavilion?" "Which guardian was your special favourite?" 
At first I thought this was just the drugs, but then I realised his mind was 
clear enough. What he wanted was not just to hear about Hailsham, but to 
remember Hailsham, just like it had been his own childhood. He knew he was close 
to completing and so that's what he was doing: getting me to describe things to 
him, so they'd really sink in, so that maybe during those sleepless nights, with 
the drugs and the pain and the exhaustion, the line would blur between what were 
my memories and what were his. That was when I first understood, really 
understood, just how lucky we'd been-Tommy, Ruth, me, all the rest of us.</P>
<P>.</P>
<P>Driving around the country now, I still see things that will remind me of 
Hailsham. I might pass the corner of a misty field, or see part of a large house 
in the distance as I come down the side of a valley, even a particular 
arrangement of poplar trees up on a hillside, and I'll think: "Maybe that's it! 
I've found it! This actually is Hailsham!" Then I see it's impossible and I go 
on driving, my thoughts drifting on elsewhere. In particular, there are those 
pavilions. I spot them all over the country, standing on the far side of playing 
fields, little white prefab buildings with a row of windows unnaturally high up, 
tucked almost under the eaves. I think they built a whole lot like that in the 
fifties and sixties, which is probably when ours was put up. If I drive past one 
I keep looking over to it for as long as possible, and one day I'll crash the 
car like that, but I keep doing it. Not long ago I was driving through an empty 
stretch of Worcestershire and saw one beside a cricket ground so like ours at 
Hailsham I actually turned the car and went back for a second look.</P>
<P>We loved our sports pavilion, maybe because it reminded us of those sweet 
little cottages people always had in picture books when we were young. I can 
remember us back in the Juniors, pleading with guardians to hold the next lesson 
in the pavilion instead of the usual room. Then by the time we were in Senior 
2-when we were twelve, going on thirteen-the pavilion had become the place to 
hide out with your best friends when you wanted to get away from the rest of 
Hailsham.</P>
<P>The pavilion was big enough to take two separate groups without them 
bothering each other-in the summer, a third group could hang about out on the 
veranda. But ideally you and your friends wanted the place just to yourselves, 
so there was often jockeying and arguing. The guardians were always telling us 
to be civilised about it, but in practice, you needed to have some strong 
personalities in your group to stand a chance of getting the pavilion during a 
break or free period. I wasn't exactly the wilting type myself, but I suppose it 
was really because of Ruth we got in there as often as we did.</P>
<P>Usually we just spread ourselves around the chairs and benches-there'd be 
five of us, six if Jenny B. came along-and had a good gossip. There was a kind 
of conversation that could only happen when you were hidden away in the 
pavilion; we might discuss something that was worrying us, or we might end up 
screaming with laughter, or in a furious row. Mostly, it was a way to unwind for 
a while with your closest friends.</P>
<P>On the particular afternoon I'm now thinking of, we were standing up on 
stools and benches, crowding around the high windows. That gave us a clear view 
of the North Playing Field where about a dozen boys from our year and Senior 3 
had gathered to play football. There was bright sunshine, but it must have been 
raining earlier that day because I can remember how the sun was glinting on the 
muddy surface of the grass.</P>
<P>Someone said we shouldn't be so obvious about watching, but we hardly moved 
back at all. Then Ruth said: "He doesn't suspect a thing. Look at him. He really 
doesn't suspect a thing."</P>
<P>When she said this, I looked at her and searched for signs of disapproval 
about what the boys were going to do to Tommy. But the next second Ruth gave a 
little laugh and said: "The idiot!"</P>
<P>And I realised that for Ruth and the others, whatever the boys chose to do 
was pretty remote from us; whether we approved or not didn't come into it. We 
were gathered around the windows at that moment not because we relished the 
prospect of seeing Tommy get humiliated yet again, but just because we'd heard 
about this latest plot and were vaguely curious to watch it unfold. In those 
days, I don't think what the boys did amongst themselves went much deeper than 
that. For Ruth, for the others, it was that detached, and the chances are that's 
how it was for me too.</P>
<P>Or maybe I'm remembering it wrong. Maybe even then, when I saw Tommy rushing 
about that field, undisguised delight on his face to be accepted back in the 
fold again, about to play the game at which he so excelled, maybe I did feel a 
little stab of pain. What I do remember is that I noticed Tommy was wearing the 
light blue polo shirt he'd got in the Sales the previous month-the one he was so 
proud of. I remember thinking: "He's really stupid, playing football in that. 
It'll get ruined, then how's he going to feel?" Out loud, I said, to no one in 
particular: "Tommy's got his shirt on. His favourite polo shirt."</P>
<P>I don't think anyone heard me, because they were all laughing at Laura-the 
big clown in our group-mimicking one after the other the expressions that 
appeared on Tommy's face as he ran, waved, called, tackled. The other boys were 
all moving around the field in that deliberately languorous way they have when 
they're warming up, but Tommy, in his excitement, seemed already to be going 
full pelt. I said, louder this time: "He's going to be so sick if he ruins that 
shirt." This time Ruth heard me, but she must have thought I'd meant it as some 
kind of joke, because she laughed half-heartedly, then made some quip of her 
own.</P>
<P>Then the boys had stopped kicking the ball about, and were standing in a pack 
in the mud, their chests gently rising and falling as they waited for the team 
picking to start. The two captains who emerged were from Senior 3, though 
everyone knew Tommy was a better player than any of that year. They tossed for 
first pick, then the one who'd won stared at the group.</P>
<P>"Look at him," someone behind me said. "He's completely convinced he's going 
to be first pick. Just look at him!"</P>
<P>There was something comical about Tommy at that moment, something that made 
you think, well, yes, if he's going to be that daft, he deserves what's coming. 
The other boys were all pre- tending to ignore the picking process, pretending 
they didn't care where they came in the order. Some were talking quietly to each 
other, some re-tying their laces, others just staring down at their feet as they 
trammelled the mud. But Tommy was looking eagerly at the Senior 3 boy, as though 
his name had already been called.</P>
<P><BR>Laura kept up her performance all through the team-picking, doing all the 
different expressions that went across Tommy's face: the bright eager one at the 
start; the puzzled concern when four picks had gone by and he still hadn't been 
chosen; the hurt and panic as it began to dawn on him what was really going on. 
I didn't keep glancing round at Laura, though, because I was watching Tommy; I 
only knew what she was doing because the others kept laughing and egging her on. 
Then when Tommy was left standing alone, and the boys all began sniggering, I 
heard Ruth say:</P>
<P>"It's coming. Hold it. Seven seconds. Seven, six, five . . ."</P>
<P>She never got there. Tommy burst into thunderous bellowing, and the boys, now 
laughing openly, started to run off towards the South Playing Field. Tommy took 
a few strides after them-it was hard to say whether his instinct was to give 
angry chase or if he was panicked at being left behind. In any case he soon 
stopped and stood there, glaring after them, his face scarlet. Then he began to 
scream and shout, a nonsensical jumble of swear words and insults.</P>
<P>We'd all seen plenty of Tommy's tantrums by then, so we came down off our 
stools and spread ourselves around the room. We tried to start up a conversation 
about something else, but there was Tommy going on and on in the background, and 
although at first we just rolled our eyes and tried to ignore it, in the 
end-probably a full ten minutes after we'd first moved away-we were back up at 
the windows again.</P>
<P>The other boys were now completely out of view, and Tommy was no longer 
trying to direct his comments in any particular direction. He was just raving, 
flinging his limbs about, at the sky, at the wind, at the nearest fence post. 
Laura said he was maybe "rehearsing his Shakespeare." Someone else pointed out 
how each time he screamed something he'd raise one foot off the ground, pointing 
it outwards, "like a dog doing a pee." Actually, I'd noticed the same foot 
movement myself, but what had struck me was that each time he stamped the foot 
back down again, flecks of mud flew up around his shins. I thought again about 
his precious shirt, but he was too far away for me to see if he'd got much mud 
on it.</P>
<P>"I suppose it is a bit cruel," Ruth said, "the way they always work him up 
like that. But it's his own fault. If he learnt to keep his cool, they'd leave 
him alone."</P>
<P>"They'd still keep on at him," Hannah said. "Graham K.'s temper's just as 
bad, but that only makes them all the more care- ful with him. The reason they 
go for Tommy's because he's a layabout."</P>
<P>Then everyone was talking at once, about how Tommy never even tried to be 
creative, about how he hadn't even put anything in for the Spring Exchange. I 
suppose the truth was, by that stage, each of us was secretly wishing a guardian 
would come from the house and take him away. And although we hadn't had any part 
in this latest plan to rile Tommy, we had taken out ringside seats, and we were 
starting to feel guilty. But there was no sign of a guardian, so we just kept 
swapping reasons why Tommy deserved everything he got. Then when Ruth looked at 
her watch and said even though we still had time, we should get back to the main 
house, nobody argued.</P>
<P>Tommy was still going strong as we came out of the pavilion. The house was 
over to our left, and since Tommy was standing in the field straight ahead of 
us, there was no need to go anywhere near him. In any case, he was facing the 
other way and didn't seem to register us at all. All the same, as my friends set 
off along the edge of the field, I started to drift over towards him. I knew 
this would puzzle the others, but I kept going-even when I heard Ruth's urgent 
whisper to me to come back.</P>
<P>I suppose Tommy wasn't used to being disturbed during his rages, because his 
first response when I came up to him was to stare at me for a second, then carry 
on as before. It was like he was doing Shakespeare and I'd come up onto the 
stage in the middle of his performance. Even when I said: "Tommy, your nice 
shirt. You'll get it all messed up," there was no sign of him having heard 
me.</P>
<P>So I reached forward and put a hand on his arm. Afterwards, the others 
thought he'd meant to do it, but I was pretty sure it was unintentional. His 
arms were still flailing about, and he wasn't to know I was about to put out my 
hand. Anyway, as he threw up his arm, he knocked my hand aside and hit the side 
of my face. It didn't hurt at all, but I let out a gasp, and so did most of the 
girls behind me.</P>
<P>That's when at last Tommy seemed to become aware of me, of the others, of 
himself, of the fact that he was there in that field, behaving the way he had 
been, and stared at me a bit stupidly.</P>
<P>"Tommy," I said, quite sternly. "There's mud all over your shirt."</P>
<P>"So what?" he mumbled. But even as he said this, he looked down and noticed 
the brown specks, and only just stopped himself crying out in alarm. Then I saw 
the surprise register on his face that I should know about his feelings for the 
polo shirt.</P>
<P>"It's nothing to worry about," I said, before the silence got humiliating for 
him. "It'll come off. If you can't get it off yourself, just take it to Miss 
Jody."</P>
<P>He went on examining his shirt, then said grumpily: "It's nothing to do with 
you anyway."</P>
<P>He seemed to regret immediately this last remark and looked at me sheepishly, 
as though expecting me to say something comforting back to him. But I'd had 
enough of him by now, particularly with the girls watching-and for all I knew, 
any number of others from the windows of the main house. So I turned away with a 
shrug and rejoined my friends.</P>
<P>Ruth put an arm around my shoulders as we walked away. "At least you got him 
to pipe down," she said. "Are you okay? Mad animal."</P></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="product-related"><div class="btb-dsl-tc"><div class="btb-dsl-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-tc-acc"><div class="pr-width"><div class="wrap2lt"><h3 class="pr-selected accord-default-open"><a name="relatedAcc" href="#categoryTitle_Acc" data-cmelementid="Related Subjects_Accordion">Related Subjects</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on"><ul><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=718809">Science &amp; Technology - Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=899176">English, Scottish, &amp; Welsh Fiction</a></li></ul></div><div class="wrap2lt booksByThisAuthor"><h3 class="pr-selected"><a name="booksByThisAuthorAcc" href="#booksByThisAuthor_Acc" data-cmelementid="BooksByThisAuthor_Accordion" onclick="WebService.initialize({url:'http://services.barnesandnoble.com/v02_00/ProductSearch?Contributor=Kazuo+Ishiguro&amp;ProductType=Book&amp;ProductSort=Relevance&amp;ProductDetail=Brief&amp;Start=1&amp;Size=6&amp;AppId=bntemp&amp;bnoutput=jsonstring&amp;bncallback=webservicecallback', outputNode:document.getElementById('obbta'), StyleSheet:genericStyleSheet, moreLink:'http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Kazuo+Ishiguro', isBTOB:'false', ean:'9781400078776'});">More by This Author</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on" id="obbta"><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif" alt="loading animation"> loading...
