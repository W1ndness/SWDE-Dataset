											Pottery is one of the most ancient arts, dating back at least eight thousand years. In the novel A Single Shard by Linda Sue Park, the talent of making pottery is conveyed cleverly through the characters. The novel articulates powerful human relationships, where devastating agony and conflict are defeated by dedication and determination.<p/>     This novel takes place in a small village on the west coast of Korea, in mid-to late twelfth century. She uses all the literary devices of character, plot, figurative language, point-of-view, and setting to communicate the theme of courage and perseverance. This is portrayed in the book when Tree-ear fights through difficult times to fulfil his duties of a potter's assistant. <p/>     The three main characters are Tree-ear, Crane-man, and Min. Tree-ear is an orphan and a homeless bridge-dweller who lives with Crane-man. Tree-ear is fascinated with pottery. He occasionally sneaks behind a tree and secretly watches a respectable potter in the town of Ch'ulp'o. His name is Min. He then starts working for the potter and goes on a journey that will change his life dramatically. <p/>     Crane-man is a caring crippled man that has devoted his life to taking care or Tree-ear. He continually shares his vast practical wisdom with Tree-ear through his sayings. For example - "Scholars read the great words of the world. But you and I must learn to read the world itself." (Pg. 7) <p/>     Min is a master potter that gradually affects Tree-ears life by making him stronger so he can cope with the hardships of life. <p/>     The pace of the story starts out slowly, but quickens throughout the course of the novel. Even though, by some, this book might be categorised as dull and boring, it is quite the contrary. The plot is simple yet effective, and takes time to slowly evolve, so that in the culmination the theme has a greater impact. <p/>     The self-pride, honesty, and diligence are palpable from the beginning to conclusion of the story. Whoever reads this book is in for some surprises near the end. The book then concludes open-ended for your imagination to take over.<p/>     I think this book is appropriate for all ages, but I would personally recommend this book only to readers in grades five and up who are calm, and like art. This is a very subtle and tactful novel.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>A Single Shard<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Terry_Jr">Terry_Jr</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-2"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1252965_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780440418511_BK_7_1252965" href="#previewReview_1252965" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>November 25, 2009: 
											The Newbery Award winning book, A Single Shard by Linda Sue Park, is a simplistic, enchanting tale of a young boy named Tree-ear. This book, like all books, has faults but also humorous and enjoyable points.<p/>I found the cast of characters to be very unoriginal. There's the poor orphan boy who in the end, finally finds a true family. The wise old man who always has works of wisdom and speaks in paradoxes such as &quot;While the scholars read the great books of the word. We must learn to read the world itself.&quot; The sweet, kind wife that has nothing else but love, comfort, and food to offer. And of course, the sour old man who has a hard outer shell, a scarred past, but has a deep caring side that finally makes an appearance at the end of the story.<p/>Throught the pottery, the cliche cast, the paradoxes, and the active writing style I actually found some good themes. Some which include, that courage, perseverance, and patience are all things you need to reach your goals. This is because during the story Tree-ear showed all of these, which helped him reach his goals. Also that you should treasure everything that you have. These are just some of the many themes in Park's book.<p/>I think that Linda's purpose of writing this book was to inform her audience of Korean culture and pottery, to teach life lessons and themes and to entertain. While I feel that she has achieved the first two, I feel that she has failed with entertaining me. I do have to admit that at some points I couldn't help but ponder the meaning of some of the vocabulary used and also the paradoxes. I also will admit to laughing at some points in the story, but it was hard for me to stay interested in the story as well.  I feel that this is because in the story it felt like she had few major events and not much building between them. I also believe it's due to the way the characters showed very little emotions between each other, other than anger, very little love, and confusion.  Such as the relationship between Min and his wife. It seemed like they never interacted together in the story. I don't believe that they even said anything to each other. This expressed weak love to me because I had to assume that they loved each other because they were married without any real evidence. It was also very hard to believe that a teen would act as mature as Tree-ear did.  He was silent and answered every beck and call that an authority figure gave him without question. All of this made it difficult for me to figure the characters out and make a connection with them.<p/>Park writes with effortless simplicity which makes the story's pace moderate and easy to follow. This simplicity also makes intense moments more captivating (not to mention there are so few). The down-fall of this though is making the story almost too easy to follow and making readers bored witht the story.<p/>In my opinion, I believe that A Single Shard, is a tolerable book. I do believe that this book was not for my age group and was meant for the advanced 5th grader, a person interested in pottery and Korea, or someone looking fo a relaxing, unmemorable read. Would I pick it up at the library? No. Would I buy it for $7? No. Do I regret reading this book? No. If you're looking for a book that you would proudly display on te mantle and reread every year, than this book isn't for you.<p/>-Terry</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Prayer-for-Owen-Meany/John-Irving/e/9780345361790/?pv=y">A Prayer for Owen Meany</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Book-Thief/Markus-Zusak/e/9780375842207/?pv=y">The Book Thief</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-House-of-the-Scorpion/Nancy-Farmer/e/9780689852237/?pv=y">The House of the Scorpion</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Blue-Bloods/Melissa-de-la-Cruz/e/9781423101260/?pv=y">Blue Bloods (Blue Bloods Series #1)</a>. </p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><b>The Barnes & Noble Review</b><br>Linda Sue Park's novels are distinctive for their focus on various aspects of Korean history. <i>A Single Shard,</i> the winner of the 2002 Newbery Medal, is a tenderly rendered tale about a 12th-century Korean boy named Tree-ear, who must overcome a host of obstacles in order to attain his life's dream. 
<p>
Orphaned as a toddler, Tree-ear (named after a type of mushroom that grows out of a tree without the benefit of parent seeds) has been raised by a kindly, crippled weaver named Crane-man (so named because he has only one good leg). Over the years, they have eked out a meager but relatively happy existence living under a bridge and scavenging for food, though never stealing or begging. The town they live in, Ch'ulp'o, is renowned for the many artisans who craft the area's unique clay into beautiful celadon pottery. Tree-ear has dreams of one day creating his own pottery, and for this reason, he starts spying on one of the most gifted craftsmen in town, a cranky old codger named Min. When Tree-ear accidentally breaks some of Min's work, he offers to pay for the damage by working off the debt, hoping Min will eventually offer him an apprenticeship. 
<p>
Things don't go as planned, however. The curmudgeonly Min isn't an easy man to work with, and Tree-ear's dream of creating his own pottery seems more unattainable with each passing day. Things come to a head when Min is offered a shot at a royal commission and Tree-ear offers to carry samples of the artisan's work to the royal court -- a hike of many days across some of Korea's most unforgiving country. The journey is fraught with setbacks that test Tree-ear's courage and integrity, but in the end, he comes to know a triumph of heart, mind, and spirit that will leave him, and Korean history, forever changed.

This delightfully endearing tale is not only entertaining; it's inspirational and educational. Tree-ear's decisions and actions in the face of several ethical dilemmas exemplify honor, honesty, and integrity at their best, setting a fine example for young readers to follow. And Park's vivid portrayal of this era in Korean history offers a colorful introduction to a culture and an art form that might otherwise go unknown. <i>(Beth Amos)</i>

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Park (Seesaw Girl) molds a moving tribute to perseverance and creativity in this finely etched novel set in mid- to late 12th-century Korea. In Ch'ul'po, a potter's village, Crane-man (so called because of one shriveled leg) raises 10-year-old orphan Tree Ear (named for a mushroom that grows "without benefit of "parent-seed"). Though the pair reside under a bridge, surviving on cast-off rubbish and fallen grains of rice, they believe "stealing and begging... made a man no better than a dog." From afar, Tree Ear admires the work of the potters until he accidentally destroys a piece by Min, the most talented of the town's craftsmen, and pays his debt in servitude for nine days. Park convincingly conveys how a community of artists works (chopping wood for a communal kiln, cutting clay to be thrown, etc.) and effectively builds the relationships between characters through their actions (e.g., Tree Ear hides half his lunch each day for Crane-man, and Min's soft-hearted wife surreptitiously fills the bowl). She charts Tree Ear's transformation from apprentice to artist and portrays his selflessness during a pilgrimage to Songdo to show Min's work to the royal court he faithfully continues even after robbers shatter the work and he has only a single shard to show. Readers will not soon forget these characters or their sacrifices. Ages 10-14. (Mar.) Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.
</p><h3></h3><p>A broken piece of pottery sets events in motion as an orphan struggles to pay off his debt to a master potter. This finely crafted novel brings 12th-century Korea and these indelible characters to life.</p><h3>Children's Literature</h3><p>This beautifully-crafted tale of an orphan boy named Tree-ear takes place in 12th century Korea in the small potter's village of Ch'ulp'o. Tree-ear (named after a mushroom that grows on a tree without a parent seed) lives under a bridge with his one-legged friend, Crane-man, (hence the name) surviving on scraps pulled from rubbish heaps and rice foraged from fields. They possess a fierce integrity that keeps them from begging and stealing and share a friendship akin to father and son. Each day Tree-ear goes to the bushes behind the studio of the brilliant potter, Min, who works outside. Tree-ear dreams of one day making a pot of his own. After breaking one of Min's wares, Tree-ear is obligated to work for Min to make amends for the accident. He works diligently for the gruff old potter, collecting wood for the local kiln and retrieving and preparing clay for his master. Min's work is so admired that the king's emissary has requested a sample to be considered for a royal commission. Tree-ear, being young and in good health, travels by foot the long distance to the royal court to present two of Min's beautiful prune vases to the emissary. Along the way he is confronted with challenges both frightening and rewarding, which ultimately change his life and the lives of those around him. This moving story captures a moment in Korean history when the mystery, magic and fortitude of true artisans were valued as they dedicated their lives to create things beautiful to behold. 2001, Clarion Books/Houghton Mifflin, $15.00.

								VOYA</h3><p>This novel is a great book for young readers who enjoy historical fiction. They will enjoy learning about clay and about how artists in twelfth-century Korea made works of art. They also will like the character of Tree-ear and the way he matures and grows up. The ending brings both a happy and sad tear to the eye. This recommended book is a quick read for young teens. VOYA CODES: 4Q 3P M (Better than most, marred only by occasional lapses; Will appeal with pushing; Middle School, defined as grades 6 to 8). 2001, Clarion, 152p,</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p>Gr 5-8-Linda Sue Park's 2002 Newbery Award-winning story  (Clarion, 2001) about Tree-ear, a 12th century Korean orphan who  finds his future through his intuitive interest in the potter's  trade, is nicely rendered by Graeme Malcolm. Tree-ear's early  years have been spent in the care of the homeless but inventive  Crane-man, who has taught him to find a meal among what other  villagers have rejected as scrap and shelter beneath a bridge or  in an old kimchee cellar, as the season dictates. Now about 12  years old, Tree-ear extends his social and labor habits to an  elderly and idiosyncratic potter, first because Tree-ear must  repay Min for a pot he damaged when he touched it without  permission, and then as Min's helper, a job for which he is paid  in food and the motherly affection of Min's wife. In a village  renowned for its pottery, those in the trade eagerly anticipate  a visit from the representative of the Korean court, each potter  hoping that his designs will be selected for royal use. Tree-ear  discovers a rival potter's invention of a new surface design  technique that he knows Min could use to better effect than does  the inventor. Eventually, the technique is revealed and Min is  able to adapt it to his excellent work, sending Tree-ear on a  long and dangerous journey to court with two sample pieces. By  the time Tree-ear arrives, he has but a single shard to show the  court's pottery expert. Malcolm's light British accent is clear  and adds a sense of "another place, another time" to this tale.  However, many of the issues transcend centuries and cultures:  What is home? Can one own a creative idea? How much of an art  object must be seen in order to judge its quality? This book  will engage both individual readers and discussion groups; the  audio version makes it accessible to a broader audience, while  giving style and substance to those who have read the print  version.-Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CA   Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.

He had meant to hold back the good news, but the excitement spilled out of him. &quot;Crane-man! A good thing that you greeted me so just now, for later today we will have to use the proper words!&quot; He held the bag high. Tree-ear was delighted when Crane-man's eyes widened in surprise. He knew that Crane-man would guess at once&#151;only one thing could give a bag that kind of smooth fullness. Not carrot-tops or chicken bones, which protruded in odd lumps. No, the bag was filled with rice.<br><br>Crane-man raised his walking crutch in a salute. &quot;Come, my young friend! Tell me how you came by such a fortune&#151;a tale worth hearing, no doubt!&quot;<br><br>Tree-ear had been trotting along the road on his early-morning perusal of the village rubbish heaps. Ahead of him a man carried a heavy load on a jiggeh, an open-framed backpack made of branches. On the jiggeh was a large woven-straw container, the kind commonly used to carry rice.<br><br>Tree-ear knew that the rice must be from last year's crop; in the fields surrounding the village this season's rice had only just begun to grow. It would be many months before the rice was harvested and the poor allowed to glean the fallen grain from the bare fields.

A well-built man with a broad suntanned face, he pushed his straw hat back, scratched his head, and laughed ruefully.<br><br>&quot;Impatience,&quot; said the farmer. &quot;I should have had this container woven with a double wall. But it would have taken more time. Now I pay for not waiting a bit longer.&quot; He struggled out of the jiggeh's straps and inspected the container. He prodded the straw to close the gap but to no avail, so he threw his arms up in mock despair. Tree-ear grinned. He liked the farmer's easygoing nature.<br><br>&quot;Fetch me a few leaves, boy,&quot; said the farmer. Tree-ear complied, and the man stuffed them into the container as a temporary patch.<br><br>The farmer squatted to don the jiggeh.

The rice on the ground is yours if you can be troubled to gather it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Many thanks, kind sir!&quot; Tree-ear bowed, very pleased with himself.

Tree-ear often pondered these kinds of questions, alone or in discussion with Crane-man.<br><br>&quot;Such questions serve in two ways,&quot; Crane-man had explained. &quot;They keep a man's mind sharp&#151;and his thoughts off his empty stomach.&quot;<br><br>Now, as always, he seemed to know Tree-ear's thoughts without hearing them spoken. &quot;Tell me about this farmer,&quot; he said. &quot;What kind of man was he?&quot;<br><br>Tree-ear considered the question for several moments, stirring his memory. At last, he answered, &quot;One who lacks patience&#151;he said it himself. He had not wanted to wait for a sturdier container to be built. And he could not be bothered to pick up the fallen rice.&quot; Tree-ear paused. &quot;But he laughed easily, even at himself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If he were here now, and heard you tell of waiting a little longer before speaking, what do you think he would say or do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He would laugh,&quot; Tree-ear said, surprising himself with the speed of his response.

But besides standing on one leg, cranes are also a symbol of long life.&quot; True enough, Crane-man added.
