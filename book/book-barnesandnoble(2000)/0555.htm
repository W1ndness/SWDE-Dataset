Anthony Rabinowitz Gersten assumed her marriage was great &#151; and why not? Jonah Gersten, M.D., a Park Avenue plastic surgeon, clearly adored her. He was handsome, successful, and a doting dad to their four-year-old triplets Dashiell, Evan, and Mason. But when Jonah is found in the Upper East Side apartment of second-rate "escort" Dorinda Dillon, Susie is overwhelmed with questions left unanswered. It's bad enough to know your husband's been murdered, but even worse when you're universally pitied (and quietly mocked) because of the sleaze factor. None of it makes sense to Susie &#151; not a sexual liaison with someone like Dorinda, not the "better not to discuss it" response from Jonah's partners. With help from her toughtalking, high-style Grandma Ethel who flies in from Miami, she takes on her snooty in-laws, her husband's partners, the NYPD, and the DA (is the person arrested for the homicide the actual perp, or just an easy mark for a prosecutor who hates the word "unsolved"?), as she tries to prove that her wonderful life with Jonah was no lie. Susan Isaacs brilliantly turns the conventions of the mystery on end as Susie Gersten, suburban mom, floral designer, and fashion plate, searches not so much for answers to her husband's death as for answers to her own life.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Bestseller Isaacs draws on tony Long Island, gritty New York City, and a tabloid-friendly murder for this smart-alecky whodunit/surprisingly sweet love story. Susan is left alone with her three boys, big suburban house, and nagging questions when plastic surgeon hubby Jonah Gersten turns up dead in a hooker's Upper East Side apartment. Though the police and prosecutors wind up their case against call girl Dorinda Dillon, it's far from settled for Susan. &ldquo;It simply didn't add up, in either my head or my heart,&rdquo; she confesses. And what better sidekick to track down the truth than Susan's rogue granny, Ethel. What follows is an intricate and fascinating dissection of Susan's marriage, family, husband's medical practice and partners, and the unwitting call girl at the center of it all. Isaacs (Past Perfect) brings it all together in this fast and furious ride through wanton greed, fragile relationships, and love worth fighting for. (July)

											John and Susie Gersten live the perfect life with their four years old identical male triplets (Dashiell, Evan and Mason) in exclusive Shorehaven, Long Island.  He is a thriving Manhattan plastic surgeon and she a floral designer although the income exclusively comes for his practice.  They employ a housekeeper and two Norwegian au pairs.<p/><p/>However, the Gerstein family idyllic life ends abruptly when he is found murdered in the apartment of a high priced hooker.  Susie rejects the NYPD-District Attorney's assertion that escort Dorinda Dillon killed her client with a scissor because the widow strongly believes her late spouse would not cheat on her.  With the aid of her grandma Ethel, Susie investigates who killed her husband and why.<p/><p/>More of a sharp character study than an amateur sleuth; Susie's objective is not to free Dorinda, but to prove to her friends, family and the tabloids that her wonderful life was genuine.  Her belief in her husband's fidelity is based on his treatment of her and his being a devoted loving father.  Although the story line takes a while to set the table, Susie's account makes for a strong tale.  The story line skewers the wealthy avaricious people who never have enough money; admonishes the legal system for settling for the easiest resolution; and bites the media for dumbing down reporting with sound bite analysis.  Susan Isaacs provides a strong look at the grimier side of the American dream.<p/><p/>Harriet Klausner</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35706212.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Susan Isaacs</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Sands Point, New York</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>December 07, 1943</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Brooklyn, New York</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Honorary Doctorate, Queens College</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>John Steinbeck Award, 1999</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.susanisaacs.com">* Susan Isaacs's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Susan Isaacs, novelist, essayist and screenwriter, was born in Brooklyn and educated at Queens College. After leaving school, she worked as an editorial assistant at <I>Seventeen</I> magazine. In 1968, Susan married Elkan Abramowitz, a then a federal prosecutor. She became a senior editor at <I>Seventeen</I> but left in 1970 to stay home with her newborn son, Andrew. Three years later, she gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. During this time she freelanced, writing political speeches as well as magazine articles. Elkan became a criminal defense lawyer.<p>    In the mid-seventies, Susan got the urge to write a novel. A year later she began working on what was to become <I>Compromising Positions</I>, a whodunit set on suburban Long Island. It was published in 1978 by Times Books and was chosen a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. Her second novel, <I>Close Relations</I>, a love story set against a background of ethnic, sexual and New York Democratic politics (thus a comedy), was published in 1980 by Lippincott and Crowell and was a selection of the Literary Guild.  Her third, <I>Almost Paradise</I>, was published by Harper & Row in 1984, and was a Literary Guild main selection; in this work Susan used the saga form to show how the people are molded not only by their histories, but also by family fictions that supplant truth. All of Susan's novels have been <I>New York Times</I> bestsellers. Her fiction has been translated into thirty languages.  <p>    In 1985, she wrote the screenplay for Paramount's <I>Compromising Positions</I>, which starred Susan Sarandon and Raul Julia. She also wrote and co-produced Touchstone Pictures' <I>Hello Again</I>. The 1987 comedy starred Shelley Long and Judith Ivey.<p>    Her fourth novel, <I>Shining Through</I>, set during World War II, was published by Harper & Row in 1988. Twentieth-Century Fox's film adaptation starred Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith. Her fifth book, <I>Magic Hour</I>, a coming-of-middle-age novel as well as a mystery, was published in January 1991. <I>After All These Years</I> was published in 1993; critics lauded it for its strong and witty protagonist. <I>Lily White</I> came out in 1996 and <I>Red, White and Blue</I> in 1998. All the novels were published by HarperCollins and were main selections of the Literary Guild. In 1999, Susan's first work of nonfiction, <I>Brave Dames and Wimpettes: What Women Are Really Doing on Page and Screen</I>, was published by Ballantine's Library of Contemporary Thought.  During 2000, she wrote a series of columns on the presidential campaign for <I>Newsday</I>. <I>Long Time No See</I>, a Book of the Month Club main selection, was published in September 2001; it was a sequel to <I>Compromising Positions</I>. Susan's tenth novel is <I>Any Place I Hang My Hat</I> (2004).<p>    Susan Isaacs is a recipient of the Writers for Writers Award and the John Steinbeck Award. She serves as chairman of the board of Poets & Writers and is a past president of Mystery Writers of America. She is also a member of the National Book Critics Circle, The Creative Coalition, PEN, the American Society of Journalists and Authors, the International Association of Crime Writers, and the Adams Round Table. She sits on the boards of the Queens College Foundation, the Walt Whitman Birthplace Association, the North Shore Child and Family Guidance Association, the Nassau County Coalition Against Domestic Violence and is an active member of her synagogue. She has worked to gather support for the National Endowment of the Arts' Literature Program and has been involved in several anti-censorship campaigns. In addition to writing books, essays and films, Susan has reviewed books for <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>The Los Angeles Times</I>, <I>The Washington Post</I> and <I>Newsday</I> and written about politics, film and First Amendment issues. She lives on Long Island with her husband. <p>    <I>Biography courtesy of the author's official web site.</I></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some outtakes from our interview with Isaacs</I>: <p>    <b>"My first job was wrapping shoes in a shoe store</b> in the low-rent district of Fifth Avenue and saying �Thank you!' with a cheery smile. I got canned within three days for not wrapping fast enough, although I suspect that often my vague, future-novelist stare into space while thinking about sex or lunch did not give me a smile that would ring the bell on the shoe store's cheer-o-meter." <p>    <b>"I constantly have to fight against the New York Effect</b>, an overwhelming urge to wear black clothes so everyone will think, Egad, isn't she chic and understated! I'm not, by nature, a black-wearing person. (I'm not, by nature, a chic person either.) I like primary colors as well as bright purple, loud chartreuse, and shocking pink. And that's just my shoes." <p>    <b>"I'm not a great fan of writing classes</b>. Yes, they do help people sometimes, especially with making them write regularly. But the aspiring writer can be a delicate creature, sensitive or even oversensitive to criticism. I was that way: I still am. The problem begins with most people's natural desire to please. In a classroom situation, especially one in which the work will be read aloud or critiqued in class, the urge to write something likable or merely critic-proof can dam up your natural talent. Also, it keeps you from developing the only thing you have is a writer -- your own voice. Finally, you don't know the people in a class well enough to figure out where their criticism is coming from. A great knowledge of literature? Veiled hostility? The talent is too precious a commodity to risk handing it over to strangers." <p>    <b>"Writing is sometimes an art, and it certainly is a craft</b>. But it's also a job. I go to work five or six days a week (depending how far along I am with my work-in-progress). Like most other people, there are days I would rather be lying in a hammock reading or going to a movie with a friend. But whether you're an artist or an accountant, you still have to show up at work. Otherwise, it is unlikely to get done."<p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2004, Susan Isaacs took some time out to answer our questions about her favorite books, authors, and interests: </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  For a couple of months during college, I was wowed by H. L. Mencken's book of essays, <I>Prejudices</I>. Its influence was both positive and negative. I loved the author's iconoclastic instincts, his razzle-dazzle language, and his contemptuous take on the assorted idiocies of American politics and culture. My infatuation could not last longer than a couple of months because of Mencken's off-the-cuff racist and anti-Semitic asides: How could anyone that smart be that stupid? <p>    In any case, while in Mencken mode, I wrote an essay for the college newspaper defending the fraternity/sorority system. (Fortunately, I can find no trace of this piece and thus can avoid confronting my younger, dopier, and more arrogant self.) The response was, to me, astounding.  More pats on the back then I could count and, on the other hand, a stunning number of outraged letters to the editor protesting what I had written. A grand fuss, but it brought me little pleasure. True, I loved the attention, but it didn't take me long to realize both the applause and the fuming was not for me, but rather, for my competent imitation of H. L. Mencken.<p>    A little more than a decade later, when I began writing my first novel, I started to realize that all I had as a writer was my own voice. Sure, I could imitate Mencken or, for that matter, Jane Austen or Oscar Wilde. But that was just a clever college-kid trick. Mencken and Austen and Wilde were far better Menckens and Austens and Wildes than I could ever be. Besides, why would any reader bother with an imitation when they could read the real thing? All I could be, for better or worse, was Susan Isaacs.<p>       <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Jane Eyre</I> by Charlotte Bront� -- Jane is my favorite example of a complex and heroic female character, a brave dame. She has high moral standards, stands up to injustice and is willing to leave civilization and face the wild, even death, rather than do wrong.<p>    <li><I>Great Expectations</I> by Charles Dickens -- Dickens pulls off a double whammy here, offering a brilliant view of the different classes of British society while creating wonderfully memorable characters. I've always been fascinated by climbs up and down the social ladder. My novel <I>Any Place I Hang My Hat</I> (note to the subtle way I've insinuated myself alongside Charles Dickens) is a 21st-century look at such a climb: When you are able to fit in anywhere, from the visitors' room at Sing-Sing to the dining room at the Harvard Club, where do you truly belong? Everywhere? Or no place at all?<p>  <li><I>Pride and Prejudice</I> and <I>Emma</I> by Jane Austen -- My two favorite Austen novels. I love her characters, the relationships, her genius for the telling detail, as well as tough-mindedness side by side with her compassion. And of course her brilliant wit.<p>    <li><I>I Capture the Castle</I> by Dodie Smith -- With its first sentence ("I write this sitting in the kitchen sink."), I was hooked into what I consider one of the most luminous coming-of-age novels. Its narrator, 17-year-old Cassandra Mortman, is incredibly smart and appealing. Dodie Smith wrote this novel in the 1940s, but its chin-up heroine is an up-to-the-minute girl who becomes a woman in the course of this book.<p>    <li><I>Sophie's Choice</I> by William Styron -- Styron's novel about a Christian woman who survives her ordeal in a concentration camp juxtaposes the bright light of American innocence with the dark knowledge of Europe under the Nazis. The writing is superb, the characters unforgettable.<p>    <li><I>The Great Gatsby</I> by F. Scott Fitzgerald -- Okay, F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel is on just about everybody's Top Ten list, and with good reason: while at first it seems simply a first-class snapshot of East Coast types at one moment in time, it really is a profound and complex work of art about what we Americans long for and what we actually wind up with. Gatsby and company hold up Fitzgerald's mirror in which we readers see our optimism, na�vet�, hypocrisy, and casual cruelty.<p>    <li><I>The Stand</I> by Stephen King -- Here's King's take on the brightness and darkness in American life, a huge, apocalyptic novel that, like nearly all of the author's work, is compulsively readable.<p>    I'm an avid reader of nonfiction, too, so I have to add: <p>    <li><I>All the President's Men</I> by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -- Woodward and Bernstein's book about how they broke and then followed the Watergate story reads like a cross between a noir whodunit and one of those scary, dystopian novels about the undermining of the democratic system, like Sinclair Lewis's <I>It Can Happen Here</I>. These two then-young reporters had the guts and the brains to trace what looked like a cheesy burglary all the way up to President Nixon's White House.<p>    <li><I>The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Visions of Glory, 1874-1932</I> by William Manchester -- The first volume of one of the best-written biographies ever about one of the rare aristocrats who actually was aristocratic. What a giant he was! Compared with him, every politician today... better yet, let's not compare.<P>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Singin' in the Rain</I> -- The best musical ever made.<p>  <li>The <I>Lord of the Rings</I> trilogy -- This is one of the rare times that a film adaptation faithful to the novels on which it's based really works. Having slogged through big movies from <I>Lawrence of Arabia</I> to <I>Troy</I>, I loved its grandness and many of its larger-than-life characters, although Gimli the dwarf reminded me of a Mike Myers routine and Frodo kept bringing to mind my friend Barbara from high school, but without the wit. Anyhow, I loved the books and I loved the movies.<p>    <li><I>All About Eve</I> -- When I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn, I watched this great Bette Davis movie and said to myself, Wow, <I>this</I> is sophisticated. I still think so. It celebrates the glamour of the theater and its actors, directors, and playwrights while keeping tongue in cheek and eyebrow arched. <p>  <li><I>Radio Days</I> -- Woody Allen's film evokes not just the magic of radio but the magic of being an imaginative, smart-ass Jewish kid growing up in Queens during World War II. There isn't one frame of the film that is sentimental, but its sentiment for that medium that pulled the family and country together is true-blue.<p>  <li><I>Rashomon</I> -- Kurosawa's movie about the murder of a man and the rape of his wife, as seen from the points of view of four different people, is a classic in every sense: It asks the big questions (What is truth? Is there an objective reality?) while breaking new ground in the telling of events. Through the camera's eye we see not just of four different versions of these two crimes but four different worldviews of the characters.<p>    <li><I>Citizen Kane</I> -- Orson Welles's finest work is indeed the great movie it's touted to be, but I love it for Welles's extraordinary portrayal of a man's journey from decency to corruption, along with another of my favorites, <I>The Godfather</I>, in which Al Pacino made a similar journey.<p>    <li><I>Seems Like Old Times</I> -- This is a brilliant Shakespearean comedy that happens to be written by Neil Simon. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  If even a radio were playing in the house across the street, I would not be able to write. When I'm inventing characters and creating a universe, that of my novel, I can't have any distractions from the universe I'm living in.  <p>    My knowledge of orchestral music composed between Mozart and Gershwin is close to nil. As for opera, give me melody -- Puccini, Verdi, Bizet. I am a word person: The music I enjoy most has lyrics. So I love the standards, Jerome Kern, Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter, and so forth. For me, they are best sung by performers with the intelligence and sensitivity to get at the meaning of the words without sacrificing the music. Give me Frank Sinatra, Dinah Washington, and that most underrated of singers, Louis Armstrong. And of course I love rock, although what I enjoy most is the music of my childhood and teenage years. So it's Bill Haley and the Comets through the Beatles. <p>     <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  Well, right now I've been listening to an unabridged recording of <I>Anna Karenina</I>. Over the years, I started it a couple of times but for some reason always gave up. Yet here I am most afternoons, sneaking off for time alone with Tolstoy. So my book club would feature books I've given up on which everybody else says are a must-read: Even if I still hated the book, I would read it in the hope of getting elucidated by my fellow book club members. Some possibilities: Doris Lessing's <I>The Golden Notebook</I>, Stendhal's <I>The Red and the Black</I>, and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez's <I>One Hundred Years of Solitude</I>. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  Whatever strikes me. A bestselling novel, a worst-selling novel that looks intriguing, a big fat coffee-table book with photographs of bats, or French couture. A biography. A book on the development of language, or the thousand best recipes for cheesecake.<p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  What I have on my desk is usually a mess. Looking down right now, I see a pair of sparkly red, blue, and aqua clip-on earings that felt too tight a few days ago, a micro drive, malachite beads I brought home from Africa and plan to give to an old family friend, an empty eyeglass case, and a folded-up copy of Chapter 7 of my current novel, <I>Any Place I Hang My Hat,</I> with a footer that indicates it was printed out on July 31, 2003; my shopping list and "Ann and Al's anniversary" is scribbled on it. Near the lamp, there's a CD sent to me by a pal, a Vietnam vet who has lately fallen in love with World War II love songs. It includes guaranteed tear-jerkers like "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and "Something to Remember You By." And an empty Diet Coke can.<p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  No real horror stories. I was able to find an agent fairly quickly, and <I>Compromising Positions</I> was sold within a couple of months. It was only later that she told me it had been turned down by four or five publishers. The reasons were as varied as the publishers: The novel was too comic for a mystery; no one wanted to read a whodunit with a Long Island housewife as the detective; it might make a good paperback original published by somebody else; it was too different.<p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be?</b><br>  What I'm interested in is any new, original voice. I was so happy for the chance to choose a novel for the <I>Today</I> show Book Club, because having read Matthew Sharpe's <I>The Sleeping Father</I>, I said to myself, "Hey, this is an extraordinary talent, someone who can interweave humor with great sadness." I felt that same "what a unique talent!" thrill when I read Colson Whitehead's <I>The Intuitionist</I> and Jennifer Weiner's <I>Good in Bed</I>.<p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Most of all, keep writing. If you have finished a novel and have done everything you possibly can to make it good (no waiting around for a dream editor to work with you), then began another novel. Also, if you spent six months or four years writing, it should be worth a few weeks of your time to research finding an agent and also to work up a brilliant one-page query letter to be sent to agents.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P><b>A rare mix of wit, social satire, and suspense, along with characters who leap from the page to speak directly to the reader &#151; a moving story about a love that just won't give up, <i>As Husbands Go</i> is the latest from critically acclaimed, bestselling author, Susan Isaacs.</b><P>Call her superficial, but Susie B. Anthony Rabinowitz Gersten assumed her marriage was great &#151; and why not? Jonah Gersten, M.D., a Park Avenue plastic surgeon, clearly adored her. He was handsome, successful, and a doting dad to their four-year-old triplets Dashiell, Evan, and Mason. But when Jonah is found in the Upper East Side apartment of second-rate "escort" Dorinda Dillon, Susie is overwhelmed with questions left unanswered. It's bad enough to know your husband's been murdered, but even worse when you're universally pitied (and quietly mocked) because of the sleaze factor. None of it makes sense to Susie &#151; not a sexual liaison with someone like Dorinda, not the "better not to discuss it" response from Jonah's partners. With help from her toughtalking, high-style Grandma Ethel who flies in from Miami, she takes on her snooty in-laws, her husband's partners, the NYPD, and the DA (is the person arrested for the homicide the actual perp, or just an easy mark for a prosecutor who hates the word "unsolved"?), as she tries to prove that her wonderful life with Jonah was no lie. Susan Isaacs brilliantly turns the conventions of the mystery on end as Susie Gersten, suburban mom, floral designer, and fashion plate, searches not so much for answers to her husband's death as for answers to her own life.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Bestseller Isaacs draws on tony Long Island, gritty New York City, and a tabloid-friendly murder for this smart-alecky whodunit/surprisingly sweet love story. Susan is left alone with her three boys, big suburban house, and nagging questions when plastic surgeon hubby Jonah Gersten turns up dead in a hooker's Upper East Side apartment. Though the police and prosecutors wind up their case against call girl Dorinda Dillon, it's far from settled for Susan. &ldquo;It simply didn't add up, in either my head or my heart,&rdquo; she confesses. And what better sidekick to track down the truth than Susan's rogue granny, Ethel. What follows is an intricate and fascinating dissection of Susan's marriage, family, husband's medical practice and partners, and the unwitting call girl at the center of it all. Isaacs (Past Perfect) brings it all together in this fast and furious ride through wanton greed, fragile relationships, and love worth fighting for. (July)
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Imagine being the smart and adored wife of a marvelous and successful man as well as the proud, if harried, mother of his darling four-year-old triplet boys in New York City. Then, one seemingly ordinary day, your thoroughly reliable husband does not return home from work. Isaacs vividly conveys the initial panic and gut-wrenching fear that Susie Gersten feels in those first hours as she contacts family members, his colleagues, and the police. Days go by with no word, and Susie fears the worst. Nothing, however, could have prepared her for the news that her beloved husband, Dr. Jonah Gersten, was found murdered in a call girl's apartment. Susie can't accept it, and by asking questions and challenging assumptions, she fights for the memory of her good marriage. VERDICT Issacs's (Past Perfect) latest novel depicts the hardship of a sudden death and the capacities of a clever and spirited woman to stay engaged in the world while struggling with grief. For all of its serious aspects, there are good measures of wit and fun here. All of Isaacs's novels have been New York Times best sellers&mdash;this one will be no exception. [See Prepub Alert, LJ 2/15/10.]&mdash;Sheila Riley, Smithsonian Inst. Libs., Washington, D.C.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>What was Susie Gersten's perfect husband doing in the apartment of a medium-rent call girl?Getting stabbed with a pair of scissors, it turns out, following 80 not-very-suspenseful pages devoted to filling in the back story after Jonah goes missing. On paper the Gerstens seem perfect. They have a lovely home in Shorehaven, Long Island, funded by Jonah's lucrative Manhattan plastic-surgery practice (Susie's floral-design business is more of a hobby). They have adorable four-year-old triplets (in vitro, natch), two live-in Norwegian au pairs and a full-time housekeeper-it's a pretty great life. Jonah, narrator Susie tells us, was devoted to her and not the cheating kind; we tend to believe her, since she rarely has a good word to say about anyone else. Susie is a trademark zingy Isaacs heroine (Past Perfect, 2007, etc.), happy to tell us all about her designer clothes, her better-than-decent looks and her fondness for life's finer things. It's no big shock when she confesses, "I'd never been the plumbing-the-depths type," but she's fun to be with and mildly witty about her snobbish in-laws, her dismal parents, the entitled senior partner in Jonah's group practice and the dowdy homicide chief who rushes to declare the call girl the perp. The semi-snide repartee was fresher three decades ago in Compromising Positions (1978), and Susie's grief at losing Jonah never has much emotional force, though her determination to vindicate her marriage rings true. None of this is meant to be taken terribly seriously, even after Susie joins forces with her elegant grandmother to investigate the holes in the DA's case. There's only one other viable suspect, and when the homicide chief finally admits thatSusie has fingered the real murderer, our heroine seems more concerned about not being thanked properly than she is happy that the killer of darling Jonah is going to jail. The mystery is barely there, but Isaacs' fans will enjoy another sharp-tongued romp through the New York privileged classes and their foibles.

<p>

She began as someone for whom bravery was defined as electing to wear wide-leg pants in a season of skinny crops. Was there a way for such a woman not only to think courageously but to act it? Or was it simply too late?
<p>
	I've got a license to daydream. Being a novelist is the adult version of a kid creating a make-believe world. But unlike a child, a writer of fiction has to come up with a structured story, one that has as much meaning for others as it has for her. 
<p>
There is no "right" way to begin a novel, but for me, plot has to wait. The character comes first. Some new person comes strolling into my head asking I write his or her story. If I ignore them they insist. If I mutter, I don't think so, even the quietest ones get pushy: Just do it! They're convinced they picked the right writer for the job and they don't like resistance. 
<p>
I guess I picked them, too-no matter who they are or how unlikely a character-author pair we seem at first. Slowly, we form a working relationship. They begin to confide in me. I listen, ask questions. Gradually, it becomes a conversation that continues throughout the writing of their (fictional) memoir. 
Having said all that, As Husbands Go didn't happen that way. The would-be protagonist who came striding into my consciousness made me want to plead with her For God's sake, find some other novelist! But I couldn't whip up the courage because-I'm almost embarrassed to say it-this new, ultra-cool character in my head was too intimidating to challenge. 
<p>
Not that she seemed hostile, loathsome, or even unlikable. In fact, she was the 2010 version of the American dream, female division: devoted mother (of four-year-old triplets, no less), loving wife. She had a successful, non-husband-threatening career as a floral designer, along with great looks and an enviable body. Money was no problem. Oh, and she had sublime taste. She stirred up every idiotic insecurity I'd experienced between sixth grade and my fiftieth birthday. Looking at her, my mind's eye flickered uneasily. Talk about statuesque! I noted that her height and model-sleekness were enhanced by Jean Paul Gaultier jeans and Louboutin stilettos. My normal protection against such blatant elegance would have been to embrace the Me = Genuine, She = Superficial defense, which allows me to congratulate myself for not being the sort who'd spend eight hundred dollars on shoes.<p>
What kept me interested in her was a puzzlement. Why was some empty suit (albeit a Prada) bothering me? I was a novelist, after all, not a stylist. And why did I need her? Did I want to spend the next two years growing progressively wearier of her 'tude, sublime appearance, and overt self-confidence? How could I explore the depths of a character when there seemed to be only shallowness?<p>
Still, she got me wondering (not for the first time) what it must be like to be able to get along on your looks. Is it a perpetual high? Do women like this character merely glide through life, never experiencing the rough patches necessary for developing moral fiber? Were the people she charmed so preoccupied with her surface that they never challenged her ideas or values-letting her remain an exquisitely wrapped but empty package? Or were beautiful people no different from everybody else-aside from being capable of finding pleasure when shopping for bathing suits? <p>
Our culture now places more emphasis on the visual than ever before. I needed to check out whether our greater-than-ever fascination with beauty, fashion, celebrity-style in general-keeps us from looking below the surface.<p>
In case you're wondering, my being intrigued and somewhat daunted by this character did not arise from some lifelong "I look like Quasimodo with a wig" anguish. I'm okay. Nevertheless, "gorgeous" would never appear on any Top 10 List of Adjectives Most Frequently Applied to Susan Isaacs. Furthermore, I couldn't imagine writing a novel about someone who had that "g" word, along with "stunning" and "chic," on hers. <p>
	One microsecond later. Or maybe it was two weeks. Hard to tell, as my Susan-the-novelist mind often does its work on its own while Susan-the-person carries on with what non-novelists refer to as real life. However long it really was, when the beaut next appeared in my consciousness, she was no longer someone to be intimidated by or condescended to. She was clear to me. Amazingly, I liked her. (Not that you need to like or even respect your protagonist. I can't imagine Dostoevsky thinking, Gee, that Raskolnikov is a total sweetheart.) <p>
I knew my protagonist's name was Susan B Anthony Rabinowitz Gersten and-surprise!-she was going to show everyone the stuff from which she was made: a lot more than sugar and spice and La Prairie makeup. I couldn't wait to write about her.<p>
Best of all, I wasn't observing her from the outside. I was inside her head. Not only was I comfortable in there, I felt at home; Susie and I had undergone that magical author-subject merge. We'd become one (though not to the point of my being able to wear her clothes).<p>
From the inside looking out, I comprehended what it was like to be self-assured and pretty, just a tad away from beautiful: It felt good. Okay, that sensation was not enough to create a fully realized protagonist. But I now understood that Susie's preoccupation with appearances was the key to her inner life. Her own prettiness and presentation was always a work in progress. The world beyond herself was subject to similar scrutiny. She'd been born with a sense of order and style. For me, seeing the world with that artistic eye was so challenging. I'd never been the sort who instinctively knew which car or chair or abstract expressionist painting had intrinsic worth. I rarely had the urge to rearrange anyone's furniture.<p>
What was it like to be supersensitive to fashion, art, or people's appearances? I had my own supersensitivity-to nuances in language and behavior-but I wanted to experience the world through the eyes of someone who had the Eye.<p>
After I had that insight into Susie, the rest of the novel fell into place fast. Her background: She'd been born into a rather boring, mildly depressed family-a swan among ugly ducks. I could see her growing up in a dreary Brooklyn apartment, yearning for some quality in her life. Okay, some of that yearning turned into banal social ambition, the desire to be in a position where she could own the lovely things she believed were necessary for fulfillment and status. But Susie also needed to create beauty for others who didn't know how. I got a flash of her arranging roses in a bowl, inhaling their sweetness, getting pleasure from the process as well as the results. Bingo! She became a floral designer. <p>
And who would be the man of her dreams? Jonah Gersten, a plastic surgeon, a man who also had the Eye, the aesthetic sense, as well as the need to make things beautiful. And since life is never perfect, Susie's backstory included a struggle with infertility that did have a happy ending: as the novel opens, she and Jonah are the exultant though frazzled parents of four-year-old triplet sons.<p>
Backstory is dandy, but I needed a front story. I later realized it had been waiting for me from the moment I took on the voice of someone who is all about surfaces. What would happen when something occurs, something potentially shattering, to demolish a gorgeously constructed existence? Could Susie face the truth, no matter how awful? She might be willing, but would she be able to stand up for this truth, fight for herself and her family? Was there substance beneath the style? <p>
Also, with all the current chatter about values, family and otherwise, few people truly have to put up or shut up. But here was my protagonist, thirty-five years old, someone who'd never given morality a thought beyond the vague understanding that it has to do with the Ten Commandments (of which, maybe, she could recite five). Facing what might be a major injustice-the wrong person being convicted of a crime-could she act? Was it even her responsibility, considering that all the authorities considered the prosecutor's case a slam dunk? Can someone whose lifetime thinking about morality probably totaled two minutes develop a sense of ethics, along with the courage to actually do the right thing? <p>
So that's how I began. I joined with my new companion, Susan B Anthony Rabinowitz Gersten, saw through her eyes, thought her thoughts, comprehended all she was up against. Now I could finally do what she'd asked of me: set down her story.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="product-related"><div class="btb-dsl-tc"><div class="btb-dsl-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-bc-acc"><div class="btb-dsr-tc-acc"><div class="pr-width"><div class="wrap2lt"><h3 class="pr-selected accord-default-open"><a name="relatedAcc" href="#categoryTitle_Acc" data-cmelementid="Related Subjects_Accordion">Related Subjects</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on"><ul><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=541">Women's Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=707">Love &amp; Relationships - Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?cat=817880">Crimes - Fiction</a></li></ul></div><div class="wrap2lt booksByThisAuthor"><h3 class="pr-selected"><a name="booksByThisAuthorAcc" href="#booksByThisAuthor_Acc" data-cmelementid="BooksByThisAuthor_Accordion" onclick="WebService.initialize({url:'http://services.barnesandnoble.com/v02_00/ProductSearch?Contributor=Susan+Isaacs&amp;ProductType=Book&amp;ProductSort=Relevance&amp;ProductDetail=Brief&amp;Start=1&amp;Size=6&amp;AppId=bntemp&amp;bnoutput=jsonstring&amp;bncallback=webservicecallback', outputNode:document.getElementById('obbta'), StyleSheet:genericStyleSheet, moreLink:'http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?ATH=Susan+Isaacs', isBTOB:'false', ean:'9781416573012'});">More by This Author</a></h3></div><div class="wrap9a on" id="obbta"><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif" alt="loading animation"> loading...
