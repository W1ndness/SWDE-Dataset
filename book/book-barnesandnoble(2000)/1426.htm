Three strangers who are trying to find their way in the wake of loss become entwined in an identity theft scheme, which has a resounding impact on them all. At once a gripping pageturner, a gorgeously written psychological study, and a meditation on identity in the modern world, this is a literary novel with the haunting momentum of a thriller.<p> <p><p>Dan Chaon is the author of Among the Missing, a finalist for the National Book Award, which was also listed as one of the ten best books of the year by the American Library Association, the Chicago Tribune, the Boston Globe, and Entertainment Weekly, as well as being cited as a New York Times Notable Book. Chaon&rsquo;s fiction has appeared in numerous journals and anthologies and has won both Pushcart and O. Henry awards. Chaon teaches at Oberlin College.<p>
</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Ron Charles</h3><p>Here's what can be safely revealed about <i>Await Your Reply</i>: It contains three separate stories about people driving away from their homes, abandoning their lives and remaking themselves&#8230;Any one of these arresting plots could have sustained the entire book, but Chaon rotates through them chapter by chapter. Not only that, but the chronology of each story is jumbled so that the novel isn't so much cubed as Rubik's Cubed. I know that sounds like a literary headache, but these are engrossing, nerve-racking storylines that continually hand off to one another without breaking stride, leaving us as fascinated as we are disoriented&#8230;The result is a novel that succeeds as brilliantly as the short stories that have won him a National Book Award nomination, a Pushcart Prize, an O.

											This is a unique, unusual and gripping story! It explores schizophrenia, identity theft, closure, and the need to be approved of, loved and accepted. There are three different storylines that seem to have nothing to do with each other. They lead up to some strange events that the mystery is slowly unraveled by the end of the book. <p/><p/>Miles Chesire has an identical twin whose brother, Hayden, who has been missing for a long time. He receives a strange letter from Hayden. Miles drives from Ohio to northern Canada hoping to find him. Hayden is not well and Miles feels compelled to search for him. Hayden is alleged to be brilliant and different while Miles seems to be a perfectly normal man. <p/><p/>Lucy Lattimore is dissatisfied with her life in a small town in Ohio. Soon after graduating from high school, she leaves town with her former history teacher.<p/> <p/>One story begins with a young man, Ryan, whose father assures him that he will not bleed to death as he's  rushed to the emergency room with his severed arm in an ice cooler. Jay and his son Ryan make a living stealing credit card numbers and using false identities to get cash.<p/><p/>Each story is captivating in its own right and holds the readers interest right through to the connection and intriguing end.

											The story starts with three seemingly unconnected narratives. First, that of Ryan, who in the opening scene is rushing to the hospital with a detached hand. Then also Lucy, recent high school grad running away with her history teacher. Finally, there's Miles, searching for his missing twin brother. What propels you through the book is finding how these three connect up. I had some guesses, some right, but didn't get quite how all they all fitted till the end--the author says it was the same for him, that he wrote it with those first scenes and characters in mind, then wrote them trying to figure out how they connect--maybe that helped in keeping the sense of mystery, although in the end it does fit so nicely with such a firm click there's a sense of inevitability. Besides the mystery, the theme of identity keeps recurring in this novel in interesting ways as both the key to the mystery but in a way that also has you turning in your mind what makes up your own identity. Although Lucy and Ryan have less than nice aspects to their characters, I did come to care for them (and Miles) and that was another source of suspense as you watch them get deeper into what you worry cannot end well. The prose is elegantly clean and sucked me in. One of those novels you better pick up when you can clear some hours to spend--because you won't want to put it down.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</h3><p>Personal pronouns appear in many of the titles of National Book Award finalist Dan Chaon's work.

     You and I: the questions of character and identity which form the heart of Chaon's fiction have fascinated him from the time of his childhood, when he first started wondering about the alternate life he would have lived he not been adopted. As he said in an interview with <EM>The Believer:</EM> <br><br>

<P style="MARGIN: 0px 20px">
A lot of this stuff about fate and circumstance and choice is a personal obsession.... Choices that I didn�t know about changed my life in radical ways. I find that enormously profound.... Even simple choices can have huge consequences, and we never get to do things over! Of course, probably a big part of my fascination goes back to being adopted -- growing up with the sense that there�s another life out there that I might have had, or multiple lives. <P style="MARGIN: 0px"><br><br>

     As the father of two adopted children, and as someone who has puzzled over such matters since my own childhood, un-adoptive though it was, I know exactly what Chaon means. I didn't just wonder about why I was me and you were you, I was close to obsessed with such questions. What if my mother hadn't met my father? What if that girl in college had gotten pregnant? Who would my child be if my wife and I had applied for adoption a couple of months later than we did? <br><br>
     Almost all of Chaon's writing at its heart appears to dramatize his concern about such matters. And <EM>Await Your Reply</EM>  addresses them more urgently and darkly than ever before. Its story, moving backward and forward in time, as this writer's stories often do, involves three sets of characters: Miles, who lives an anomic life in Cleveland and is sporadically driven to try to track down his twin brother, Hayden, whom he hasn't seen for ten years; Lucy, a high school girl who runs away with her charismatic and elusive English teacher, George Orson; and Ryan, who finds out he was adopted by his aunt and uncle and sets out to join his biological father, Jay, and eventually joins in Jay's financial-scam activities. The book must be read carefully, and sometimes events can be tricky to follow, but, with his structural precision, Chaon has earned the right to challenge the reader. <br><br>
     <EM>Await Your Reply</EM>  begins with a short description of Jay driving Ryan to the hospital with Ryan's severed hand -- a grisly MacGuffin-style storytelling device -- resting on a bed of ice between them. The next short take shows Lucy, after she has graduated, driving away from Pompey, Ohio, with George Orson in the dead of night. In his typically businesslike but sharp prose, Chaon tells us, "This wasn't actually as bad as it might sound. Lucy was eighteen, almost nineteen�and her parents were dead and she had no real friends to speak of." The third opener shows Miles driving through northwest Canada on his way to Alaska, in pursuit of Hayden. <br><br>
     Three driving scenes. The vast expanses of the Midwest and Canada and the nowhere of Alaska will give way to the desert city of Las Vegas and the half-a-world-away nation of Cote D'Ivoire: Chaon shakes up his six central characters and throws them like so many dice onto the felt of his inventions. The alien quality of the settings, added to the no-man�s-land of cyberspace, which Chaon also explores, puts the central narrative questions into sharp relief. The first of those questions, as you may already have guessed, is whether these characters are all part of the same novelistic game. Pretty early on, you know the answer: Yes. Then the second question arises: How? <br><br>
    A thread of this carefully woven fabric is the fraudulence of half of each of the pairs here, and the ways in which they draw their son and girlfriend and twin into frightening, illegal, and sometimes lethal entanglements: forgery, credit card shell games, money laundering, murder. A deeper connection is the philosophical problems that lurk behind and hover above all the story lines. One is the effort to conjure with the contingencies and random events that determine all our lives -- the contingencies that Chaon cites in <EM>The Believer</EM>  interview -- like Lucy's parents' death in an automobile accident. Another is to try to come to some conclusion about what identity really is -- if there is such a thing at all. (The Internet, which lends itself to depersonalization and imposture, has not changed these questions but intensified them.)  A third is whether and how our lives can be said to matter. "People like to think that what they do actually matters," the increasingly scary George Orson says, with some disdain, to Lucy, whom he has lured further into his elaborate schemes and now asks to assume a new name. George may be a cynic about whether people and what they do matter, and he's a bad guy, but I can't help feeling some similar worries emanating from the author as well. <br><br>
     I can't reveal much more than that about the plot(s) without spoiling the elegant and sometimes mordantly funny surprises of <EM>Await Your Reply</EM>. You have to read the book -- especially if you're interested in a postmodern novel that, for all its meta qualities, still works on a visceral level because of the clarity of its prose, the tension of its narrative, and the psychological insight of its author. For example, all three "victims" here -- Ryan, Lucy, and Miles -- know on some level the ominousness of the territory they've chosen to enter. About Lucy, Chaon writes: "There was a lot he hadn't told her. But so what? It was that secretive quality that drew her to him.... Why deny it?" And of Miles, who has received a letter from Hayden after a long period of silence: "He shouldn't have even opened the letter, he thought later.... But no, no. By the time he had gone up the three flights of stairs, he had already torn open the seal." <br><br>
     If the book sounds like a mystery, that's because it is -- a panoply of mysteries, in fact. Does George Foster really have any money? Who is threatening Jay? Has Hayden, like Kilroy, been here -- or there -- or not? But Chaon's deepest mysteries in <EM>Await Your Reply</EM>  are existential. And this novel is, like Aleksandar Hemon's <EM>The Lazarus Project,</EM> one of the few I've read in the last decade that genuinely deserve and renew that largely debased adjective. As Chaon says, in <EM>The Believer</EM>  interview, for him<br><br>

<P style="MARGIN: 0px 20px">
the most interesting thing about writing is getting to a place where there is more mystery at the end than there was at the beginning. Often novels try to explain the world to you. That's something I'm not interested in. I'm interested in taking things that people have neat packaged ideas about and unwrapping them and making them more complicated. <br><br>

      <P style="MARGIN: 0px">I would give him more credit than that: complex, not complicated. Here is an author who, because he was adopted, in some ways has made himself up. We all do that, to one degree or another, but adoptees face this reality more directly than the rest of us have to. Chaon has written books and now a new novel in which -- by aesthetic definition -- he has made people up. And in many of these works the characters make themselves up. In <EM>Await Your Reply,</EM> they remake themselves into different people, and they involve others in their sinister mutability. <br><br>
     You're tempted to conclude that Chaon is implying that identity itself is a fraud, until you remember that there is indeed a solid and integrated consciousness in this book -- a still point in its turning world. I'm talking about the artist himself. As always with very good art, the artifact battles with silent eloquence against the chaos out of which it was formed. --<i>Daniel Menaker</i><br><br>

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>Miles Cheshire is driving from Cleveland to Alaska in search of his disturbed twin brother, Hayden, another leg of a crusade that has consumed him for more than a decade. Ryan Schuyler is 19 when he discovers that he is adopted and his real father, a con man who deals in fraud and identity theft, now wants Ryan to live with him. Orphaned Lucy Lattimore leaves town with her former high school history teacher when his dreams of riches and travel fill the hole in her life. This chillingly harsh work by Chaon (<i>You Remind Me of Me</i>) will make you question your own identity and sense of time. His characters live on the outskirts of society, even of their own lives. Yet we are compelled to read about them, driven to see it through. <b>VERDICT</b> This novel is unrelenting, like the scene of an accident: we are repulsed by the blood, but we cannot look away. For fans of pulse-pounding drama, Chaon never fails to impress. (With an eight-city tour; library marketing.) [See Prepub Alert, <i>LJ</i>5/1/09.]<b>�Bette-Lee Fox, <i>Library Journal</i></b> </P></p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>A sprinter who excels at the 100-yard dash may never attempt a marathon. A poet who composes haiku might not be able to sustain an epic. Though writers of short stories are almost invariably encouraged to become novelists-a contract for a debut story collection is typically a bet hedged against the longer work to come-some authors who master the former don't seem as well suited to the latter. Maybe it's a question of scope, or even artistic stamina, but the novel requires a different mindset. It isn't just a longer story. Ohio's Dan Chaon, whose two collections established him as one of America's most promising short story writers, returns this fall with a second novel, Await Your Reply, easily his most ambitious work to date. As in his stories and previous novel (You Remind Me of Me, 2004), this book focuses on family dynamics, the quest for identity and the essence of the Heartland-in some ways, Chaon is to the Midwest what Richard Russo is to the Northeast-but the structure has an innovative audacity missing from his earlier, more straightforward work. The novel initially seems to be three separate narratives, presented in round-robin fashion, connected only by some plot similarities (characters on a quest or on the lam, a tragic loss of parents) and thematic underpinnings (the chimera of identity). One narrative concerns a college dropout who learns that the man he thought was his uncle is really his father, who recruits him for some criminal activity involving identity theft. The second involves an orphan who runs away with her high-school history teacher. The third features a twin in his 30s in search of his brother, likely a paranoid schizophrenic who occasionally sends messagesyet refuses to be found. It's a tribute to Chaon's narrative command that each of these parallel narratives sustains the reader's interest, even though there's little indication through two-thirds of the novel that these stories will ever intersect. And when they do, the results are so breathtaking in their inevitability that the reader practically feels compelled to start the novel anew, just to discover the cues that he's missed along the way. The novel and the short story each aspire to a different kind of perfection. We think no less of Alice Munro because she reigns supreme in the shorter form (though her short stories are longer than most). We continue to hail William Trevor and Lorrie Moore primarily for the exquisiteness of their stories, though both have attempted novels as well (shorter than many). More recently, Donald Ray Pollock's hard-hitting Knockemstiff, a debut collection of interrelated stories, could have easily been marketed as a novel. And Aleksander Hemon's return to stories with Love and Obstacles could pass as a follow-up novel to his brilliant The Lazarus Project. With Chaon, one senses that there's no going back. His stories established his early reputation. He did that. Now he's doing this.

His eyes are shut tight and his body is shaking and he is trying to hold up his left arm, to keep it elevated. We are on our way to the hospital, his father says, and Ryan&#8217;s teeth are chattering, he clenches and unclenches them, and a series of wavering colored lights&#8212;greens, indigos&#8212;plays along the surface of his closed eyelids. <br><br>On the seat beside him, in between him and his father, Ryan&#8217;s severed hand is resting on a bed of ice in an eight-quart Styrofoam cooler. <br><br>The hand weighs less than a pound.

The skin is now bluish in color. <br><br>This is about three a.m. on a Thursday morning in May in rural Michigan. Ryan doesn&#8217;t have any idea how far away the hospital might be but he repeats with his father <i>we are on the way to the hospital we are on the way to the hospital</i> and he wants to believe so badly that it&#8217;s true, that it&#8217;s not just one of those things that you tell people to keep them calm. But he&#8217;s not sure. Gazing out all he can see is the night trees leaning over the road, the car pursuing its pool of headlight, and darkness, no towns, no buildings ahead, darkness, road, moon.<br><br><br>2<br>A few days after Lucy graduated from high school, she and George Orson left town in the middle of the night. They were not fugitives&#8211;not exactly&#8211;but it was true that no one knew that they were leaving, and it was also true that no one would know where they had gone.<br><br>They had agreed that a degree of discretion, a degree of secrecy,<br>was necessary. Just until they got things figured out. George Orson was not only her boyfriend, but also her former high school history teacher, which had complicated things back in Pompey, Ohio.<br>This wasn&#8217;t actually as bad as it might sound. Lucy was eighteen,<br>almost nineteen&#8211;a legal adult&#8211;and her parents were dead, and she had no real friends to speak of. She had been living in their parents&#8217;<br>house with her older sister, Patricia, but the two of them had never been close. Also, she had various aunts and uncles and cousins she hardly talked to. As for George Orson, he had no connections at all that she knew of.<br><br>And so&#58; why not? They would make a clean break. A new life.<br><br>Still, she might have preferred to run away together to somewhere different.<br><br>They arrived in Nebraska after a few days of driving, and she was sleeping, so she didn&#8217;t notice when they got off the interstate.<br>When she opened her eyes, they were driving along a length of empty highway, and George Orson&#8217;s hand was resting demurely on her thigh&#58; a sweet habit he had, resting his palm on her leg. She could see herself in the side mirror, her hair rippling, her sunglasses reflecting the motionless stretches of lichen- green prairie grass. She sat up.<br><br>&#8220;Where are we?&#8221; she said, and George Orson looked over at her.<br>His eyes distant and melancholy. It made her think of being a child,<br>a child in that old small- town family car, her father&#8217;s thick, calloused plumber&#8217;s hands gripping the wheel and her mother in the passenger seat with a cigarette even though she was a nurse, the window open a crack for the smoke to trail out of, and her sister asleep in the backseat mouth- breathing behind their father, and Lucy also in the backseat, opening her eyes a crack, the shadows of trees running across her face, and thinking&#58; <i>Where are we?<br></i>She sat up straighter, shaking this memory away.<br><br>&#8220;Almost there,&#8221; George Orson murmured, as if he were remembering a sad thing.<br><br>And when she opened her eyes again, there was the motel. They had parked in front of it&#58; a tower rising up in silhouette over them.<br>It had taken Lucy a moment to realize that the place was supposed to be a lighthouse. Or rather&#8211;the front of the place, the fa&#231;ade, was in the shape of a lighthouse. It was a large tube- shaped structure made of cement blocks, perhaps sixty feet high, wide at the base and narrowing as it went upward, and painted in red and white barber- pole stripes.<br><br>THE LIGHTHOUSE MOTEL, said a large unlit neon sign&#8211;fancy nautical lettering, as if made of knotted ropes&#8211;and Lucy sat there in the car, in George Orson&#8217;s Maserati, gaping.<br><br>To the right of this lighthouse structure was an L- shaped courtyard of perhaps fifteen motel units; and to the left of it, at the very crest of the hill, was the old house, the house where George Orson&#8217;s parents once lived. Not exactly a mansion but formidable out here on the open prairie, a big old Victorian two- story home with all the trappings of a haunted house&#58; a turret and wraparound porch, dormers and corbeled chimneys, a gable roof and scalloped shingles. No other houses in sight, barely any other sign of civilization,<br>barely anything but the enormous Nebraska sky bending over them.<br><br>For a moment Lucy had the notion that this was a joke, a corny roadside attraction or amusement park. They had pulled up in the summer twilight, and there was the forlorn lighthouse tower of the motel with the old house silhouetted behind it, ridiculously creepy.<br>Lucy thought that there may as well have been a full moon and a hoot owl in a bare tree, and George Orson let out a breath.<br><br>&#8220;So here we are,&#8221; George Orson said. He must have known how it would look to her.<br><br>&#8220;This is it?&#8221; Lucy said, and she couldn&#8217;t keep the incredulousness out of her voice. &#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said. &#8220;George? This is where we&#8217;re going to live?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;For the time being,&#8221; George Orson said. He glanced at her ruefully,<br>as if she disappointed him a little. &#8220;Only for the time being,<br>honey,&#8221; he said, and she noticed that there were some tumbleweeds stuck in the dead hedges on one side of the motel courtyard. Tumbleweeds!<br>She had never seen such a thing before, except in movies about ghost towns of the Old West, and it was hard not to be a little freaked out.<br><br>&#8220;How long has it been closed?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I hope it&#8217;s not full of mice or&#8211;&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; George Orson said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a cleaning woman com-<br>ing out fairly regularly, so I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not too bad. It&#8217;s not abandoned or anything.&#8221;<br><br>She could feel his eyes following her as she got out and walked around the front of the car and up toward the red door of the Lighthouse. Above the door it said&#58; office. And there was another unlit tube of neon, which said&#58; NO VACANCY.<br><br>It had once been a fairly popular motel. That&#8217;s what George Orson had told her as they were driving through Indiana or Iowa or one of those states. It wasn&#8217;t exactly a <i>resort, </i>he&#8217;d said, but a pretty fancy place&#8211;&#8220;Back when there was a lake,&#8221; he&#8217;d said, and she hadn&#8217;t quite understood what he meant.<br><br>She&#8217;d said&#58; &#8220;It sounds romantic.&#8221; This was before she&#8217;d seen it.<br>She&#8217;d had an image of one of those seaside sort of places that you read about in novels, where shy British people went and fell in love and had epiphanies.<br><br>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; George Orson said. &#8220;Not exactly.&#8221; He had been trying to warn her. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call it romantic. Not at this point,&#8221; he said.<br>He explained that the lake&#8211;it was a reservoir, actually&#8211;had started to dry up because of the drought, all the greedy farmers, he said,<br>they just keep watering and watering their government- subsidized crops, and before anyone knew it, the lake was a tenth of what it had once been. &#8220;Then all of the tourist stuff began to dry up as well,<br>naturally,&#8221; George Orson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to do any fishing or waterskiing or swimming on a dry lake bed.&#8221;<br><br>He had explained it well enough, but it wasn&#8217;t until she looked down from the top of the hill that she understood.<br><br>He was serious. There wasn&#8217;t a lake anymore. There was nothing but a bare valley&#8211;a crater that had once held water. A path led down to the &#8220;beach,&#8221; and there was a wooden dock extending out into an expanse of sand and high yellow prairie grass, various scrubby plants that she imagined would eventually turn into tumbleweeds.<br>The remains of an old buoy lay on its side in the windblown dirt. She could see what had once been the other side of the lake, the opposite shore rising up about five miles or so away across the empty basin.<br><br>Lucy turned back to watch as George Orson opened the trunk of the car and extracted the largest of their suitcases.<br><br>&#8220;Lucy?&#8221; he said, trying to make his voice cheerful and solicitous.<br>&#8220;Shall we?&#8221;<br><br>She watched as he walked past the tower of the Lighthouse office and up the cement stairs that led to the old house.<br><br><br><br>3<br>By the time the first rush of recklessness had begun to burn off,<br>Miles was already nearing the arctic circle. He had been driving across Canada for days and days by that point, sleeping for a while in the car and then waking to go on again, heading northward along what highways he could find, a cluster of maps origamied on the passenger seat beside him. The names of the places he passed had become more and more fantastical&#8211;Destruction Bay, the Great Slave Lake, Ddhaw Ghro, Tombstone Mountain&#8211;and when he came at last upon Tsiigehtchic, he sat in his idling car in front of the town&#8217;s welcome sign, staring at the scramble of letters as if his eyesight might be faulty, some form of sleep- deprivation dyslexia.<br>But no. According to one of the map books he&#8217;d bought, &#8220;Tsiigeht -<br>chic&#8221; was a Gwich&#8217;in word that meant &#8220;mouth of the river of iron.&#8221;<br>According to the book, he had now reached the confluence of the Mackenzie and the Arctic Red rivers.<br><br>WELCOME TO TSIIGEHTCHIC!<br><i>Located on the site of a traditional Gwich&#8217;in fishing camp.

Somewhere on the way, the sun had begun to stop rising and setting; it appeared to move slightly to and fro across the sky, but he couldn&#8217;t be sure. Along this part of the Dempster Highway,<br>a silvery white powder was scattered on the dirt road.

He was wearing sunglasses, shivering a little, his patchy facial hair a worn yellow- brown, the color of a coffee stain. The CD player in his car was broken, and the radio played only a murky blend of static and distant garbled voices. There was no cell phone reception, of course. An air freshener in the shape of a Christmas tree was hanging from the rearview mirror, spinning in the breath of the defroster.<br><br>Up ahead, not too far now, was the town of Inuvik, and the wide delta that led to the Arctic Ocean, and also&#8211;he hoped&#8211;his twin brother, Hayden.<br><br><br><br>4<br>The man said, &#8220;Above the wrist? Or below the wrist?&#8221;<br><br>The man had a sleepy, almost affectless voice, the voice you might hear if you called a hotline for computer technical support.<br>He looked at Ryan&#8217;s father blandly.<br><br>&#8220;Ryan, I want you to tell your father to be reasonable,&#8221; the man said, but Ryan didn&#8217;t really say anything because he was crying silently. He and his father were bound to chairs at the kitchen table,<br>and Ryan&#8217;s father was shuddering, and his long dark hair fell in a tent around his face. But when he looked up, he had a troublingly stubborn look in his eyes.<br><br>The man sighed. He carefully pushed the sleeve of Ryan&#8217;s shirt up above his elbow and placed his finger on the small rounded bone at the edge of Ryan&#8217;s wrist. It was called the &#8220;ulnar styloid,&#8221;<br>Ryan remembered. Some biology class he had taken, once. He didn&#8217;t know why that term came to him so easily.<br><br><i>Above the wrist . . . </i>the man said to Ryan&#8217;s father <i>. . . or below the wrist?<br></i><br>Ryan was trying to reach a disconnected state&#8211;a <i>Zen </i>state, he thought&#8211;though the truth was that the more he tried to lift his mind out of his body, the more aware he was of the corporeal. He could feel himself trembling. He could feel the salt water trickling out of his nose and eyes, drying on his face. He could feel the duct tape that held him to the kitchen chair, the strips across his bare forearms, his chest, his calves and ankles.<br><br>He closed his eyes and tried to imagine his spirit lifting toward the ceiling. He would drift out of the kitchen, where he and his father were pinned to the hard- backed chairs, past the cluttered construction of dirty dishes piled on the counter by the sink, the toaster with a bagel still peeping up out of it; he would waft through the archway and into the living room, where a couple of black- T- shirted henchmen were carrying computer parts out of the bedrooms,<br>dragging matted tails of electrical cording and cables along behind them. His spirit would follow them out the front door, past the white van they were tossing stuff into, and on down his father&#8217;s driveway, traveling the rural Michigan highway, the moonlight flickering through the branches of trees as his spirit gained velocity, the luminous road signs emerging out of the darkness as he swept up like an airplane and the patterns of house lights and roads and streams that speckled and crisscrossed the earth growing smaller.<br><i>Wooooooooooooooooooo&#8211;</i>like a balloon with the air let out of it, a siren, a wailing wind. Like a person screaming.<br><br>He squeezed his eyes, tightened his teeth against one another as his left hand was grasped and tilted. He was trying to think of something else.<br><br>Music? A landscape, a sunset? A beautiful girl&#8217;s face?<br><br>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; he could hear himself saying, through chattering teeth.<br><br>&#8220;Dad, please be reasonable, please, please be&#8211;&#8221;<br><br>He would not think about the cutting device the man had shown them. It was just a length of wire, a very thin razor wire, with a rubber handle attached to each end of it.<br><br>He wouldn&#8217;t think about the way his father wouldn&#8217;t meet his eyes.<br><br>He wouldn&#8217;t think about his hand, the wire looped once around his wrist, his hand garroted, the sharp wire tightening. Slicing smoothly through skin and muscle. There would be a hitch, a snag,<br>when it reached the bone, but it would cut through that, too.<br><br><br><a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><P><html><body> <H4> Await Your Reply </font></H4> <b> A Novel </b></font> <hr noshade size="1"><b> By Dan Chaon </b></font></hr> <H4><b> Ballantine Books </b></H4> <font size=-1><b> Copyright &copy; 2009 </b></font> <font size=-1><b> Dan Chaon <br>All right reserved.</b></font><br> <font size=-1><b> ISBN&#58; 9780345476029 </b></font><br> <hr noshade size='1'></hr>   Chapter 1 <br><br><i>We are on our way to the hospital, Ryan&#8217;s father says. <br>Listen to me, Son&#58; <br>You are not going to bleed to death. </i><br><br>Ryan is still aware enough that his father&#8217;s words come in through the edges, like sunlight on the borders of a window shade. His eyes are shut tight and his body is shaking and he is trying to hold up his left arm, to keep it elevated. We are on our way to the hospital, his father says, and Ryan&#8217;s teeth are chattering, he clenches and unclenches them, and a series of wavering colored lights&#8212;greens, indigos&#8212;plays along the surface of his closed eyelids. <br><br>On the seat beside him, in between him and his father, Ryan&#8217;s severed hand is resting on a bed of ice in an ?eight-?quart Styrofoam cooler. <br><br>The hand weighs less than a pound. The nails are trimmed and there are calluses on the tips of the fingers from guitar playing. The skin is now bluish in color. <br><br>This is about three a.m. on a Thursday morning in May in rural Michigan. Ryan doesn&#8217;t have any idea how far away the hospital might be but he repeats with his father <i>we are on the way to the hospital we are on the way to the hospital</i> and he wants to believe so badly that it&#8217;s true, that it&#8217;s not just one of those things that you tell peopleto keep them calm. But he&#8217;s not sure. Gazing out all he can see is the night trees leaning over the road, the car pursuing its pool of headlight, and darkness, no towns, no buildings ahead, darkness, road, moon. <BR><BR><i>Continues...</i>  <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Await Your Reply</b>  by <b>Dan Chaon</b>  Copyright &copy; 2009   by Dan Chaon.
