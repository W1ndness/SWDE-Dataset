											Heart of the Sea (last book in the series) was defiantly a Nora Roberts book. Roberts' uses a fairy and a ghost from 300 years ago and ties them into the future of 3 different couples that live in today's world. <p/>I love to read fiction books, but not where the main characters might be super-human. Instead this series is most defiantly a romance novel with the main characters being regular men and women and contains a little bit of fantasy in terms of the characters and the plot. <p/>Words that I would describe this book as: Romance, Love, Fantasy, Light Humor</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Heart Of The Sea<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1161156_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780515128550_BK_1_1161156" href="#previewReview_1161156" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 27, 2009: 
											The whole triligy was fantastic. I have to admit when I started reading it I was a little bored but once you read more into the book, it was like you actually were there in Ardmore, Ireland. In this book, Heart of the Sea, young and foolish Darcy ends up falling in love with Trevor Magee,  an American man with Irish roots. It was great because every scene you could just imagine in your head. This book is perfect if you had your heart broken because it can easily be mended.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/37130000/37139526.JPG" alt="" height="147" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Nora Roberts</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>J.

And that�s on top of mastering every subgenre in the romance pie: the family saga, the historical, the suspense novel. But this most prolific and versatile of authors might never have tapped into her native talent if it hadn't been for one fateful snowstorm.     <p>As her fans well know, in 1979 a blizzard trapped Roberts at home for a week with two bored little kids and a dwindling supply of chocolate. To maintain her sanity, Roberts started scribbling a story -- a romance novel like the Harlequin paperbacks she'd recently begun reading. The resulting manuscript was rejected by Harlequin, but that didn't matter to Roberts. She was hooked on writing. Several rejected manuscripts later, her first book was accepted for publication by Silhouette.  <p>For several years, Roberts wrote category romances for Silhouette -- short books written to the publisher's specifications for length, subject matter and style, and marketed as part of a series of similar books. Roberts has said she never found the form restrictive. "If you write in category, you write knowing there's a framework, there are reader expectations," she explained. "If this doesn't suit you, you shouldn't write it. I don't believe for one moment you can write well what you wouldn't read for pleasure."  <p>Roberts never violated the reader's expectations, but she did show a gift for bringing something fresh to the romance formula. Her first book, <I>Irish Thoroughbred</I> (1981), had as its heroine a strong-willed horse groom, in contrast to the fluttering young nurses and secretaries who populated most romances at the time. But Roberts's books didn't make significant waves until 1985, when she published <I>Playing the Odds</I>, which introduced the MacGregor clan. It was the first bestseller of many.  <p>Roberts soon made a name for herself as a writer of spellbinding multigenerational sagas, creating families like the Scottish MacGregors, the Irish Donovans and the Ukrainian Stanislaskis. She also began working on romantic suspense novels, in which the love story unfolds beneath a looming threat of violence or disaster. She grew so prolific that she outstripped her publishers' ability to print and market Nora Roberts books, so she created an alter ego, J.D. Robb. Under the pseudonym, she began writing romantic detective novels set in the future. By then, millions of readers had discovered what <I>Publishers Weekly</I> called her "immeasurable diversity and talent."  <p>Although the style and substance of her books has grown, Roberts remains loyal to the genre that launched her career. As she says, "The romance novel at its core celebrates that rush of emotions you have when you are falling in love, and it's a lovely thing to relive those feelings through a book."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Roberts still lives</b> in the same Maryland house she occupied when she first started writing -- though her carpenter husband has built on some additions. She and her husband also own Turn the Page Bookstore Caf&eacute; in Boonsboro, Maryland. When Roberts isn't busy writing, she likes to drop by the store, which specializes in Civil War titles as well as autographed copies of her own books.  <p><b>Roberts sued</b> fellow writer Janet Dailey in 1997, accusing her of plagiarizing numerous passages of her work over a period of years. Dailey paid a settlement and publicly apologized, blaming stress and a psychological disorder for her misconduct.  <!-- <p><b>In 2001,</b> an average of 34 Nora Roberts books were sold every minute, according to her publicist.--></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>Excerpted from the March/April 2002 issue of </I>Book<I> magazine.</i>  <p>  <!-- <BR>  <B>DON'T WRITE OFF ROMANCE</B><BR>  Thought you could dismiss it? Think again: Meet Nora Roberts, the queen of the genre, who reigns over a changed landscape.<BR>    <BR>  <BR> -->  One afternoon when Nora Roberts was four, her two oldest brothers broke into a violent argument while they were baby-sitting her. "I peeked out of the bedroom, and they're beating the hell out of each other," Roberts says. Then her mother walked in, with a grocery bag in each hand. "One bag goes here, one bag goes there, she steps right in the middle of these two six-foot guys and she goes, boom, bam. Two backhands. And both of them go, 'Maaaaaawwwmm.' I thought right then, There's the power. She's the power."  <p>  Elly, as her family still calls her, the youngest of five and the only girl, was a quick study. "She bossed her brothers around," says her mother, Eleanor; today, "her brothers have got her on a throne." Roberts reigns over more than her family, which now includes her husband and two sons. Since her writing debut in 1981, she has helped lead American romance away from its clich&#233;s of simpering heroines and heroic rapists toward more complex characters and contemporary, multifaceted plots. Of course, sex -- passionate, tender, delayed, avoided, forced, in castles, in fields, in treetops -- continues to be a central hook. And often, the prose remains purple; Roberts herself has a propensity for phrases like "she rocked them both toward madness." But the genre with which her name is synonymous is one -- the only one -- that always puts women at the center of the universe.  <p align=center>***  <!-- <BR>  <BR>  <B>It's Good to be the Queen</B><BR> -->  <p>Two Mercedes -- a Kompressor convertible and an M-Class SUV -- and a Chrysler PT Cruiser are parked outside the rural Keedysville, Maryland, home Roberts shares with her husband. Inside, several gauzy photographs of nude models hang above the bed in the ground-floor master bedroom, and a rendition of the <EM>Casablanca</EM> movie poster -- with the couple painted in as Ilsa and Rick -- is prominent above the fireplace. Three ebullient dogs and one gnarled old mutt track in dirt and litter the house with deer bones that they've found outside.  <p>  Since moving here twenty-nine years ago, Roberts has divorced her first husband, raised their two sons (Dan, now twenty-nine, lives with his wife down the lane; Jason, twenty-six, is just over an hour away) and remarried. She has also added on a few rooms and an indoor pool; a few years ago, she bought twenty adjoining acres so she could continue to shoo deer out of the garden in her underwear without worrying about neighbors. She and her husband own a tiny bookshop in nearby Boonsboro, but Roberts spends most of her time in an upstairs office where she types, smokes and drinks diet colas eight hours a day, five days a week. It's a routine that's produced an average of seven books a year since 1981, many of them bestsellers.  <p>  Roberts knows that her work is commercial fiction and doesn't lose any sleep waiting for National Book Award nominations. The high-art literary tradition isn't what's gotten her to where she is; what has is her "real talent for storytelling," as author Jennifer Crusie (<EM>Fast Women</EM>; <EM>Welcome to Temptation</EM>) says, and a commensurate skill with plot and pacing. Readers are pulled into her story lines (which often bounce from one continent to the next) and her well-drawn characters. Fans especially admire Roberts' tough, independent heroines. "When they fit with your own circumstances," says Elizabeth Mayfield, a database administrator from Norwalk, Connecticut, "you think, Gee, there's hope for me." Roberts, however, contends that she's not writing to provide role models for anyone. "I'm gonna tell a good, entertaining story," she says. "I'm not looking to change the world."  <p>  <!-- <B>Addicted to Love&#151;and Macrame</B>  <BR> -->  Roberts was born Eleanor Marie Robertson, and she grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, about an hour from where she lives now. Her father worked as a projectionist at the local movie theater and as a stagehand until 1964, when he started a lighting company -- which is where most of the Robertson family still works. Her mother ran the family. "Mom was a very strict disciplinarian," says Roberts' brother Buzz, who is now the president of his dad's company, "but as long as you followed the rules and were polite, you didn't have a problem." He says Nora had it a little easier than her brothers. "Us boys, we knew we were low men on the totem pole. Mom was tickled pink when she had Nora."  <p>  "Her daddy worked two jobs all his life, and during the Depression, I took in roomers," says Eleanor Robertson, who at eighty-five still lives in Silver Spring and is now secretary-treasurer of the company her husband started (Bernie Robertson died in 2000). "She knows how hard we worked to give them an education and a nice home." Roberts went to Catholic schools as a child and credits much of her success to the nuns who taught her -- the discipline and guilt in her formative years did her a lot of good.  <p>  In her sophomore year of high school, Roberts transferred to public school, where she met Ronald Aufdem-Brinke; she married him at seventeen, in 1968, right after graduation. The young couple moved to Keedysville and had a small house built in the woods. While Aufdem-Brinke worked at his father's sheet-metal business and later the Robertson lighting company, Roberts took care of their two children and the house. "Oh God, I had craft addictions," Roberts says, taking a drag on a cigarette. (She runs through a pack of Winstons at a pace that doesn't quite catch up to chain-smoking but runs several steps beyond casual.) "You name it, I made it. I macram&#233;d two hammocks once. I did ceramics, I sewed the kids' clothes. I even put flies into overalls -- that is sick. I was a sick woman. I baked bread once a week. I canned jellies and made my own spaghetti sauce using my own tomatoes."  <p>  Sometime during the next decade (she calls the period her "Earth Mother" years), Roberts started to read Harlequin novels -- the short books were easy for her to finish while the kids were napping. During a blizzard in 1979, trapped inside with little more than her three- and six-year-old sons and a game of Candy Land, Roberts sat down with a pencil and wrote a manuscript of her own, a romance that she's since described as "very bad." In the next year and a half, while her kids were napping or at T-ball practice, she wrote at least six manuscripts in longhand. She submitted some of them to Harlequin, which at the time was using mainly British writers. Roberts didn't hear back, but her enthusiasm wasn't subdued. "I became a writing junkie," she says. Although she was rejected several times, she continued to write -- but started filing her manuscripts in a back drawer rather than submitting them.  <p>  Roberts then heard that a new romance publisher, Silhouette, was looking specifically for American writers, so she sent in her work. In 1980 she got a call from Nancy Jackson, a Silhouette editor, saying she had plucked one of Roberts' manuscripts -- <EM>Irish Thoroughbred</EM>, a slender love story about an Irish stable hand and her boss -- out of the slush pile. Jackson told Roberts she wanted to publish it. Eleanor Aufdem-Brinke changed her name to Nora Roberts because she says she assumed all romance authors used a <EM>nom de plume</EM>. The book "didn't make waves when it first came out," says Isabel Swift, her current editor, but it sold well in reprint. Roberts was hooked on the process, though, and published five more books the following year, eight the following and ten the year after that.  <p>  Roberts hit it big in 1985 when she wrote the first of her MacGregor family series, <EM>Playing the Odds</EM>. The book, which focuses on a matchmaking Scottish patriarch and his brood, became an immediate bestseller. Romance readers began associating the name Nora Roberts with multigenerational sagas: In addition to the MacGregors, she has written about the Donovans, a modern family of Irish magicians; the Calhouns, a family of pigheaded sisters in Maine; and the Stanislaskis, tempestuous Ukrainian immigrants.    <p align=center>***  <p>  From the beginning, Roberts' heroines were not content to wear aprons or take dictation. In <EM>Irish Thoroughbred</EM>, though Roberts' heroine was young (early twenties) and virginal (well, she was a virgin), she was a horse groomer with an independent streak. Roberts wasn't alone in giving her female characters more authority in the workforce; other American romance authors -- like Jayne Ann Krentz, Sandra Brown and Elizabeth Lowell -- were doing the same. "I think one of the great things the American writer has brought to the romance novel," Krentz says, "is a modern interpretation of women's roles and women's values." Author Janet Evanovich adds, "The genre reflects the increased power and opportunity afforded today's women. We see more variety in the genre in terms of heroine age and occupation. And today's heroine is stronger, more self-reliant. Of course, Nora was always ahead of the pack. Her heroines were always strong."  <p>  Rebecca Sullivan, a heroine in Roberts' latest romantic suspense, <EM>Three Fates</EM>, is a quintessential Nora Roberts lead: She runs the family business (giving boat tours off the western coast of Ireland) and engineers the search for the family's lost treasure. Rebecca's a smart, capable lady with a sense of humor. In the course of the story, she falls in love with a computer expert who eventually marries her -- the book ends in Ireland with the assumption that the husband will help her with the business. "I'm not interested in telling stories about weak women," Roberts says. "Or if they're weak, I want to show how they grow and how they become strong. I'm not writing about Cinderella sitting waiting for her prince to come and take her away. She'll get out of it herself. The prince is a bonus, a completion, another element -- but it's not the answer to all of her problems."  <p align=center>***  <p>  <!-- Here in the Real World</B><BR>  -->Perched on a stool next to her kitchen counter, Roberts doesn't look like a purveyor of dreams. She could be any of a million women, taking a break from a million jobs, looking toward the end of a million days. Right now, her husband is outside, working in the yard before heading to town. Later on, he'll pick up groceries, and Nora will cook dinner; favorites are pasta with red sauce or Cajun chicken. Around 7:30, the two will retire for the evening, probably settling down for a while in front of the television -- it's Thursday, so they'll probably tune in for some of <EM>Friends</EM> or <EM>ER</EM>. And that's a typical end to a typical day for the world's most popular romance author. "I always wonder if they asked Agatha Christie if she was homicidal," Roberts says with a laugh. "I don't have a romantic lifestyle."  <p>  Still, she says, it's romance books she turns to when she wants to escape reality, so maybe the queen of the realm is, finally, one of its true citizens as well. Roberts, after all, spends her days holed up in her office, writing, researching and investigating the backgrounds for her books. She loves it, she says, but it's work. And when she's done, she's done. "When I read for pleasure," she says, "give me a story."  <p>  If today's romance is escapism, millions of its readers would argue that it is also girl-power between pastel covers: adventures that belong to characters who are at their strongest -- and sexiest -- because they are women. So Roberts essentially shrugs off the contempt reserved for romance novels as sexist and ignorant. Still, she recognizes that the genre carries a lot of baggage -- even she finds herself sneaking reads when she's out in public. A lot of the embarrassment, she says, has to do with the way the books look. "It's mostly hard for me when she's falling out of her dress, and he has his mouth on her tit," Roberts says, describing what she calls "nursing mother" covers. She taps her lighter against the counter and rolls her eyes. "To sit on an airplane and read <EM>that</EM>?"</div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>The Barnes & Noble Review</b></font><br>

<b> Nora's Heart</b>
<br>
-->
Nora Roberts closes out her magical Irish trilogy, which began with <i>Jewels of the Sun</i> and <i>Tears of the Moon,</i> with a final tale of love and legend, <i>Heart of the Sea</i>. As with the first two books, this one follows the lives of the talented and temperamental Gallagher clan, this time focusing on the beautiful and strong-willed Darcy. Serving as background is the legend of two star-crossed lovers whose ghosts haunt the small Irish village of Ardmore, where the Gallaghers live. Cursed to spend eternity apart, their only hope lies in the true-love matching of a trio of couples, two of which have already been joined. But bringing together two people as stubborn and strong-willed as Darcy Gallagher and millionaire Trevor Magee may prove to be more than even two determined spirits can handle.

<p>Darcy Gallagher possesses the voice of an angel, the looks of a temptress, and the temper of a hellcat. She has always believed she was fated to find fame and fortune and assumed it would come in the form of a rich man who would someday appear and sweep her off her feet. And when handsome developer Trevor Magee comes to Ardmore to build a theater that will tie in with the Gallaghers' pub, Darcy thinks she may have finally found her man. 

<p>Trevor can't deny his attraction to Darcy, but he is determined to keep things on an emotionally uncomplicated level. Besides, he has business with Darcy as well, as he intends to sign her to a recording contract that will bring her the wealth and lifestyle she desires. But Trevor underestimates the determination of the otherwordly Prince Carrick and Lady Gwendolyn, who are desperate to make their final love match. The more Trevor tries to keep his distance from Darcy (emotional distance, that is, since physically they can't resist one another) the closer he seems to get to her. Still, it will take a life-changing event and the near loss of all that Trevor values before he can realize just how deep his attachment to Darcy runs. 

<p>Roberts effortlessly interweaves past and present in this delightful tale, tying together the legends and magic of Irish folklore with the pressures and passions of modern-day life. Her love of the land and its people comes across with crystal clarity, and Roberts demonstrates some magical abilities of her own, casting the spell that continues to garner her legions of devoted readers.

</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>Darcy Gallagher has always believed in the pull of fate, the magic of legend . . . and the importance of money. She longs to find a rich man who will sweep her away - into a world filled with glamour and adventure, and the exotic life that is her destiny. <br><br>A wealthy businessman with Irish blood, Trevor Magee has come to Ardmore to build a theater - and uncover secrets hidden in his family's past. He thought he had given up on love long ago, but Darcy Gallagher tempts him like no woman ever has. She's gorgeous, intelligent, and she knows what she wants - and he's more than willing to give it to her. But as their mutual attraction flares into passion, they look into their hearts - and find out what happens when you truly believe. . .</p><h3>Romantic Times - 
								Jill M. Smith</h3><p>As she as done so many times before, the awesome Ms. Roberts brings joy, excitement and powerful romance to her stories. <I>Heart of the Sea</i> is the highly satisfying conclusion to her most recent Irish Trilogy.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Veteran romance writer Roberts is known for her ability to deliver a rich and satisfying story, and this conclusion to her Irish trilogy (following Jewels of the Sun and Tears of the Moon) is no exception. The final installment begins when wealthy builder Trevor Magee arrives in the Irish village of Ardmore. There he meets Darcy Gallagher, who aspires to the more lavish lifestyle that only a wealthy husband can provide. Immediately attracted, the two begin to negotiate an arrangement uncomplicated by the messiness of love. Their hearts have other plans, however--and so does Carrick, a brooding faerie prince who uses them to plot a reunion with his long-dead and long-lost lover, Lady Gwen. Although she could have limited her bold, beautiful and wealth-conscious protagonists to 1980s glitz-and-glamour superficiality, Roberts is triumphant in realizing fully developed characters, as both Trevor and Darcy turn out to be vulnerable human beings with appealingly ordinary hopes and dreams.

</div><a name="CHP"></a><h3>Read a Sample Chapter</h3><P> <BR> <P> <FONT SIZE="+2"> Chapter One </FONT><P><BR> <P> The village of Ardmore sat snug on the south coast of Ireland, in the county of Waterford, with the Celtic Sea spread out at its feet. The stone seawall curved around, following the skirt of the golden-sand beach. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It boasted in its vicinity a pretty jut of cliffs upholstered with wild grass, and a hotel that clung to them. If one had a mind to, it was a pleasant if hearty walk on a narrow path around the headland, and at the top of the first hill were the ruins of the oratory and well of Saint Declan. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The view was worth the climb, with sky and sea and village spread out below. This was holy ground, and though dead were buried there, only one grave had its stone marked. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The village itself claimed neat streets and painted cottages, some with the traditional thatched roofs, and a number of steep hills as well. Flowers grew in abundance, spilling out of window boxes, baskets, and pots, and dooryards. It made a charming picture from above or below, and the villagers were proud to have won the Tidy Town award two years running. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atop Tower Hill was a fine example of a round tower, with its conical top still in place, and the ruins of the twelfth-century cathedral built in honor of Saint Declan. Folks would tell you, in case you wondered, that Declan arrived thirty years before good Saint Patrick. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that they were bragging, they were just letting you know how things stood. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those interested in such matters would find examples of ogham carving on the stones put for safekeeping inside the rooflesscathedral, and Roman arcading faded with time and wind but still worth the study. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the village itself made no attempt at such grandeur. It was merely a pleasant place with a shop or two and a scatter of cottages built back away from lovely sand beaches. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sign for Ardmore said FAILTE, and that was "welcome." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was that very combination of ancient history and simple character and hospitality that interested Trevor Magee. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His people had come from Ardmore and Old Parish. Indeed, his grandfather had been born here, in a small house very near Ardmore Bay, had lived the first years of his life breathing that moist sea air, had perhaps held his mother's hand as she'd walked to the shops or along the surf. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His grandfather had left his village and his country, taking his wife and young son with him to America. He had never been back, and so far as Trevor knew, had never looked back either. There had been a distance and a bitter one, between the old man and the country of his birth. Ireland and Ardmore and the family Dennis Magee had left behind had rarely been spoken of. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Trevor's image of Ardmore had a ripple of sentiment and curiosity through it, and his reasons for choosing it had a personal bent. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he could afford personal bents. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a man who built, and who, as his grandfather and father before him, built cleverly and well. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His grandfather had made his living laying brick, and made his fortune speculating on properties during and after World War II, until the buying and selling of them was his business, and the building done by those he hired. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Magee had been no more sentimental about his laborer's beginnings than he had been about his homeland. To Trevor's recollection, the man had shown no sentiment about anything. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Trevor had inherited the heart and hands of the builder as much as the cool, hard sense of the businessman, and he had learned to use both. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would use them both here, and a dash of sentiment as well, to build his theater, a traditional structure for traditional music, with its entrance the already established pub known as Gallagher's. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deal with the Gallaghers had been set, the ground broken for the project before he'd been able to hack through his schedule for the time he wanted to spend here. But he was here now, and he intended to do more than sign checks and watch. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted his hands in it. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man could work up a good sweat even in May in such a temperate climate when he spent a morning hauling concrete. That morning Trevor left the cottage he'd decided to rent for the duration of his stay wearing a denim jacket and carrying a steaming mug of coffee. Now, a handful of hours later, the jacket had been tossed aside, and a thin line of damp ran front and back down his shirt. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'd have paid a hundred pounds for one cold beer. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pub was only a short walk through the construction rubble. He knew from stopping in the day before that it did a brisk business midday. But a man could hardly quench his thirst with a chilly Harp when he forbade his employees to drink on the job. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rolled his shoulders, circled his neck as he scanned the site. The concrete truck let out its continuous rumble, men shouted, relaying orders or acknowledging them. Job music, Trevor thought. He never tired of it. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a gift from his father. Learn from the ground up had been Dennis Junior's credo, and the third-generation Magee had done just that. For more than ten years&#151;fifteen if he counted the summers he'd sweated on construction sites&#151;he'd learned just what went into the business of building. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The backaches and blood and aching muscles. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At thirty-two, he spent more time in boardrooms and meetings than on a scaffold, but he'd never lost the appreciation, or the satisfaction of swinging his own hammer. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He intended to indulge himself doing just that in Ardmore, in his theater. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He watched the small woman in a faded cap and battered boots circle around, gesture as the wet concrete slid down the chute. She scrambled over sand and stone, used her shovel to rap the chute and alert the operator to stop, then waded into the muck with the other laborers to shovel and smooth. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brenna O'Toole, Trevor thought, and was glad he'd followed his instincts there. Hiring her and her father as foremen on the project had been the right course of action. Not just for their building skills, he decided&#151;though they were impressive&#151;but because they knew the village and the people in it, kept the job running smoothly and the men happy and productive. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public relations on this sort of project were just as vital as a sturdy foundation. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, indeed, they were working out well. His three days in Ardmore had shown him he'd made the right choice with O'Toole and O'Toole. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Brenna climbed out again, Trevor stepped over, extended a hand to give her a final boost. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks." She sliced her shovel into the ground, leaned on it, and despite her filthy boots and faded cap, looked like a pixie. Her skin was pure Irish cream, and a few curls of wild red escaped the cap. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tim Riley says we won't have rain for another day or two, and he has a way of being right about such things more than he's wrong. I think we'll have the slab set up for you before you have to worry about weather." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You made considerable progress before I got here." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure, and once you gave us the high sign there was no reason to wait. We'll have you a good, solid foundation, Mr. Magee, and on schedule." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trev." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, Trev." She tipped back her cap, then her head so she could meet his eyes. She figured him a good foot higher than her five-two, even wearing her boots. "The men you sent along from America, they're a fine team." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As I handpicked them, I agree." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought his voice faintly aloof, but not unfriendly. "And do you never pick females then?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled slowly so it seemed that humor just moseyed over his face until it reached eyes the color of turf smoke. "I do indeed and as often as possible. Both on and off the job. I've put one of my best carpenters on this project. She'll be here next week." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's good to know my cousin Brian wasn't wrong in that area. He said you hired by skill and not gender. It's a good morning's work here," she added, nodding to the site. "That noisy bastard of a truck will be our constant companion for a while yet. Darcy'll be back from her holiday tomorrow, and I can tell you she'll bitch our ears off about the din." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a good noise. Building." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've always thought the same." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stood a moment in perfect accord while the truck vomited out the last yard of concrete. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll buy you lunch," Trevor said. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll let you." Brenna gave a whistle to catch her father's attention, then mimed spooning up food. Mick responded with a grin and a wave, then went back to work. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's in his heaven," Brenna commented as they walked over to rinse off their boots. "Nothing makes Mick O'Toole happier than finding himself in the middle of a job site, the muckier the better." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satisfied, Brenna gave her feet a couple of stomps, then headed around to the kitchen door. "I hope you'll take some time to see the area while you're here, instead of locking yourself into the job at hand." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I plan to see what's around. "He had reports, of course&#151;detailed reports on tourist draws, road conditions, routes to and from major cities. But he intended to see for himself. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needed to see it, Trevor admitted to himself. Something had been pulling him toward Ireland, toward Ardmore, for more than a year. In dreams. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, now there's a fine-looking man doing what he does best," Brenna said when she pushed open the kitchen door. "What have you for us today, Shawn?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned from the enormous old stove, a rangy man with shaggy black hair and eyes of misty blue. "For the special we've sea spinach soup and the beef sandwich. Good day to you, Trevor. Is this one working you harder than she should?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She keeps things moving." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And so I must, for the man in my life is slow. I wonder, Shawn, if you've selected another tune or two for Trevor's consideration." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've been busy catering to my new wife. She's a demanding creature." So saying, he reached out to cradle Brenna's face and kiss her. "Get out of my kitchen. It's confusing enough around here without Darcy." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She'll be back tomorrow, and by this time of the day you'll have cursed her a dozen times." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you think I miss her? Give your order to Sinead," he told Trevor. "She's a good girl, and our Jude's been working with her. She just needs a bit more practice." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A friend of my sister Mary Kate is Sinead," Brenna told Trevor as she pushed open the door that swung between kitchen and pub. "A good-natured girl, if a bit scattered in the brain. She wants to marry Billy O'Hara, and that is the sum total of her ambitions at this time." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what does Billy O'Hara have to say?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being not quite so ambitious as Sinead, Billy keeps his mouth shut. Good day to you, Aidan." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And to you." The oldest of the Gallaghers worked the bar and had his hands on the taps as he looked over. "Will you be joining us for lunch, then?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That we will. We've caught you busy." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God bless the tour buses." With a wink, Aidan slid two pints down the bar to waiting hands. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want us to take it in the kitchen?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need for that unless you're in a great hurry." His eyes, a deeper blue than his brother's, scanned the pub. "Service is a mite slower than our usual. But there's a table or two left." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We'll leave it to the boss." Brenna turned to Trevor. "How will you have it?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's get a table." The better to watch how the business ran. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He followed her out and sat with her at one of the mushroom-shaped tables. There was a buzz of conversation, a haze of smoke, and the yeasty scent of beer. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you have a pint?" Brenna asked him. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not until after the workday." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her lips twitched as she kicked back in her chair. "So I've heard from some of the men. Word is you're a tyrant on this particular matter." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't mind the term "tyrant." It meant he was in control. "Word would be correct." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll tell you this, you may have a bit of a problem enforcing such a rule around here. Many who'll labor for you were nursed on Guinness and it's as natural to them as mother's milk." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fond of it myself, but when a man or woman is on my clock, they stick with mother's milk." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you're a hard man, Trevor Magee." But she said it with a laugh. "So tell me, how are you liking Faerie Hill Cottage?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very much. It's comfortable, efficient, quiet, and has a view that rips your heart into your throat. It's just what I was looking for, so I'm grateful you put me on to it." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not a problem, not a problem at all. It's in the family. I think Shawn misses the little kitchen there, as the house we're building's far from finished. More than livable," she added, as it was one of their current sore points, "but I figure to concentrate on the kitchen there on my off days so he'll be happier." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'd like to see it." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you?" Surprised, she angled her head. "Well, you're welcome any time. I'll give you the direction. Do you mind me saying I didn't expect you to be as friendly a sort of man as you seem to be?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you expect?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More of a shark, and I hope that doesn't offend you." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't. And it depends on the waters where I'm swimming." He glanced over, and his face warmed as Aidan's wife came up to the table. But When he started to rise, Jude waved him down again. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I'm not joining you, but thanks." She rested a hand on her very pregnant belly. "Hello, I'm Jude Frances and I'll be your server today." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn't be on your feet like this, carrying trays." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jude sighed as she took out her order pad. "He sounds like Aidan. I put my feet up when I need to, and I don't carry anything heavy. Sinead can't handle things on her own." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not to worry, Trevor. Why me own blessed mother dug potatoes on the day I was born, then went back to roast them after the delivery." At Trevor's narrowed glance, Brenna chuckled. "Well, maybe not, but I'll wager she could have. I'll have today's soup, if you don't mind, Jude, and a glass of milk," she added with a wicked smile for Trevor. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same," he said, "plus the sandwich." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A fine choice. I'll be right back with it." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She's stronger than she looks," Brenna told him when Jude moved to another table. "And more stubborn. Now that she's found her direction, so to speak, she'll only work harder to prove she can do what you tell her she shouldn't. Aidan won't let her overdo, I promise you. The man adores her." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I've noticed. The Gallagher men seem to be devoted to their women." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So they'd better be, or their women will know why." Relaxed, she kicked back, pulled off her cap. Those red curls tumbled down. "So you aren't finding it, I guess we'd say `too rustic' for you&#151;out in the countryside here after being used to New York City?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought of the job sites he'd experienced&#58; mud slides, floods, blistering heat, petty vandalism, and sabotage. "Not at all. The village is exactly what I expected after Finkle's reports." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, yes, Finkle." She remembered Trevor's scout very well. "Now there's a man I believe prefers urban conveniences. But you're not so ... particular, then." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm very particular, depending. That's why I incorporated most of your design into the theater project." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now that's a fine and sneaky compliment." And nothing could have pleased her more. "I suppose I was angling more toward the personal. I have a special fondness for the cottage on Faerie Hill, and I wasn't sure you'd find the place to your liking. Thinking, I suppose, a man with your background and wherewithal would be more inclined to settle at the cliff hotel with maid service and the restaurant and so forth." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hotel rooms become confining. And I find it interesting to stay in the house where the woman who was engaged to one of my ancestors was born, and lived, and died." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She was a fine woman, Old Maude. A wise woman." Brenna kept her eyes on Trevor's face as she spoke. "Her grave's up near the well of Saint Declan, and it's there you can feel her. She's not the one in the cottage now." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brenna lifted her eyebrows. "You don't know the legend, then? Your grandfather was born here, and your father as well, though he was a babe when they sailed to America. Still, he visited many years back. Did neither of them tell you the story of Lady Gwen and Prince Carrick?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. So it would be Lady Gwen who haunts the cottage?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen her?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Trevor hadn't been raised on legends and myths, but there was more than enough Irish in his blood to cause him to wonder about them. "But there's a feminine feel to the place, almost a fragrance, so odds are for the lady." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You'd be right about that." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who was she? I figure if I'm sharing quarters with a ghost, I should know something about her." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No careless dismissal of the subject, no amused indulgence of the Irish and their legends, Brenna noted. Just cool interest. "You surprise me again. Let me see to something first. I'll be right back." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fascinating, Trevor mused. He had himself a ghost. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'd felt things before. In old buildings, empty lots, deserted fields. It wasn't the kind of thing a man generally talked about at a board meeting or over a cold one with the crew after a sweaty day's work. Not usually. But this was a different place, with a different tone. More, he wanted to know. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything to do with Ardmore and the area was of interest to him now. A good ghost story could draw people in just as successfully as a well-run pub. It was all atmosphere. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gallagher's was exactly the kind of atmosphere he'd been looking for as a segue into his theater. The old wood, blackened by time and smoke and grease, mated comfortably with the cream-colored walls, the stone hearth, the low tables and benches. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bar itself was a beauty, an aged chestnut that he'd already noted the Gallaghers kept wiped and polished. The age of customers ranged from a baby in arms to the oldest man Trevor believed he'd ever seen, who was balanced on a stool at the far end of the bar. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several others he took as locals just from the way they sat or smoked or sipped, and three times that many who could be nothing other than tourists with their camera bags under their tables and their maps and guidebooks out. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conversations were a mix of accents, but predominant was that lovely lilt he'd heard in his grandparents' voices until the day they died. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wondered if they hadn't missed hearing it themselves, and why they'd never had a driving urge to come to Ireland again. What were the bitter memories that had kept them away? Whatever, curiosity about them had skipped over a generation and now had caused him to come back and see for himself. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More, he wondered why he should have <I>recognized</I> Ardmore and the view from the cottage and even now know what he would see when he climbed the cliffs. It was as if he carried a picture in his mind of this place, one someone else had taken and tucked away for him. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd had no pictures to show him. His father had visited once, when he'd been younger than Trevor was now, but his descriptions had been sketchy at best. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reports, of course. There had been detailed photographs and descriptions in the reports Finkle had brought back to New York. But he'd known&#151;before he'd opened the first file, he'd already known. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inherited memory? he mused, though he didn't put much stock in that sort of thing. Inheriting his father's eyes, the clear gray color, the long-lidded shape of them, was one matter. And he was told he had his grandfather's hands, and his mind for business. But how did a memory pass down through the blood? <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He toyed with the idea as he continued to scan the room. It didn't occur to him that he looked more the local than the tourist as he sat there in his work clothes, his dark blond hair tousled from the morning's labor. He had a narrow, rawboned face that would put most in mind of a warrior, or perhaps a scholar, rather than a businessman. The woman he'd nearly married had said it looked to be honed and sculpted by some wild genius. The faintest of scars marred his chin, a result of a storm of flying glass during a tornado in Houston, and added to the overall impression of toughness. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a face that rarely gave anything away. Unless it was to Trevor Magee's advantage. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment it held a cool and remote expression, but it shifted into easy friendliness when Brenna came back toward the table with Jude. Brenna, he noted, carried the tray. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've asked Jude to take a few moments to sit and tell you about Lady Gwen," Brenna began and was already unloading the order. "She's a <I>seanachais</I>." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Trevor's raised eyebrow, Jude shook her head. "It's Gaelic for storyteller. I'm not really, I'm just&#151;" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And who has a book being published, and another she's writing. Jude's book'll be out at the end of this very summer," Brenna went on. "It'll make a lovely gift, so I'd keep it in mind when you're out shopping." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brenna." Jude rolled her eyes. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll look for it. Some of Shawn's song lyrics are stories. It's an old and honored tradition." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, he'll like that one." Beaming now, Brenna scooped up the tray. "I'll deal with this, Jude, and give Sinead a bit of a goose for you. Go ahead and get started. I've heard it often enough before." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She has enough energy for twenty people." A little tired now, Jude picked up her cup of tea. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm glad I found her for this project. Or that she found me." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'd say it was a bit of both, since you're both operators." She caught herself, winced. "I didn't mean that in a negative way." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wasn't taken in one. Baby kicking? It puts a look in your eye," Trevor explained, "My sister just had her third." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Third?" Jude blew out a breath. "There are moments I wonder how I'm going to manage the one. He's active. But he's just going to have to wait another couple of months." She ran a hand in slow circles over the mound of her belly, soothing as she sipped. "You may not know it, but I lived in Chicago until just over a year ago." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made a noncommittal sound. Of course he knew, he had extensive reports. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My plan was to come here for six months, to live in the cottage where my grandmother lived after she lost her parents. She'd inherited it from her cousin Maude, who'd died shortly before I came here." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The woman my great-uncle was engaged to." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. The day I arrived, it was raining. I thought I was lost. I had been lost, and not just geographically. Everything unnerved me." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You came alone, to another country?" Trevor cocked his head. "That doesn't sound like a woman easily unnerved." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's something Aidan would say." And because it was, she found herself very comfortable. "I suppose it's more that I didn't know my own nerve at that point. In any case, I pulled into the street, the driveway actually, of this little thatched-roof cottage. And in the upstairs window I saw a woman. She had a lovely, sad face and pale blond hair that fell around her shoulders. She looked at me, our eyes connected. Then Brenna drove up. It seemed I'd stumbled across my Own cottage, and the woman I'd seen in the window was Lady Gwen." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ghost?" <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right, yes. It sounds impossible, doesn't it? Or certainly unreasonable. But I can tell you exactly what she looked like. I've sketched her. And I knew no more of the legend when I came here than you appear to know now." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'd like to hear it." <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I'll tell you." Jude paused as Brenna came back, sat, and tucked into her meal. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had an easy way with a story, Trevor noted. A smooth and natural rhythm that put the listener into the tale. She told him of a young maid who'd lived in the cottage on the faerie hill. A woman who cared for her father, as her mother had been lost in childbirth, who tended the cottage and its gardens and who carried herself with pride. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the green slope of the hill was the silver glory of the faerie raft, the palace where Carrick ruled as prince. He was also proud, and he was handsome, with a flowing mane of raven-black hair and eyes of burning blue. Those eyes fell upon the maid Gwen, and hers upon him. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They plunged into love, faerie and mortal, and at night when others slept, he would take her flying on his great winged horse. Never did they speak of that love, for pride blocked the words. One night Gwen's father woke to see her with Carrick as they dismounted from his horse. And in fear for her, he betrothed her to another and ordered her to marry without delay. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carrick flew on his horse to the sun, and gathered its burning sparks in his silver pouch. When Gwen came out of the cottage to meet him before her wedding, he opened the bag and poured diamonds, jewels of the sun, at her feet. "Take them and me," he said, "for they are my passion for you." He promised her immortality, and a life of riches and glory. But never once did he speak, even then, of love. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So she refused him, and turned from him. The diamonds that lay on the grass became flowers. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twice more he came to her, the next time when she carried her first child in her womb. From his silver pouch he poured pearls, tears of the moon that he'd gathered for her. And these, he told her, were his longing for her. But longing is not love, and she had pledged herself to another. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she turned away, the pearls became flowers. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years passed before he came the last time, years during which Gwen raised her children, nursed her husband through his illness, and buried him when she was an old woman. Years during which Carrick brooded in his palace and swept through the sky on his horse. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dived into the sea to wring from its heart the last of his gifts to her. These he poured at her feet, shimmering sapphires that blazed in the grass. His constancy for her. When now, finally, he spoke of love, she could only weep bitter tears, for her life was over. She told him it was too late, that she had never needed riches or promises of glory, but only to know that he loved her, loved her enough that she could have set aside her fear of giving up her world for his. And as she turned to leave him this time, as the sapphires bloomed into flowers in the grass, his hurt and his temper lashed out in the spell he cast. She would find no peace without him, nor would they see each other again until three times lovers met and, accepting each other, risking hearts, dared to choose love over all else. <P> <BR> <P> Three hundred years, Trevor thought later as he let himself into the house where Gwen had lived and died. A long time to wait. He'd listened to Jude tell the tale in her quiet, storyteller's voice, without interrupting. Not even to tell her that he knew parts of the story. Somehow he knew. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He'd dreamed them. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hadn't told her that he, too, could have described Gwen, down to the sea green of her eyes and the curve of her cheek. He'd dreamed her as well. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And had, he realized, nearly married Sylvia because she'd reminded him of that dream image. A soft woman with simple ways. It should have been right between them, he thought as he headed upstairs to shower off the day's dirt. It still irritated him that it hadn't been. In the end, it just hadn't been right. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She'd known it first, and had gently let him go before he'd admitted he already had his eye on the door. Maybe that was what bothered him most of all. He hadn't had the courtesy to do the ending. Though she'd forgiven him for it, he'd yet to forgive himself. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He caught the scent the minute he stepped into the bedroom. Delicate, female, like rose petals freshly fallen onto dewy grass. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A ghost who wears perfume," he murmured, oddly amused. "Well, if you're modest turn your back." So saying, he stripped where he stood, then walked into the bath. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spent the rest of his evening alone, catching up on paperwork, scanning the faxes that had come in on the machine he'd brought with him, shooting off replies. He treated himself to a beer and stood outside with it in the last of the dying light listening to the aching silence and watching stars pulse to life. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim Riley, whoever the hell he was, looked to be right. There was no rain coming yet. The foundation he was building would set clean. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he turned to go back in, a streak of movement overhead caught his eye. A blur of white and silver across the darkening sky. But when he looked back for it, narrowing his eyes to scan, he saw nothing but stars and the rise of the quarter moon. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A falling star, he decided. A ghost was one thing, but a flying horse ridden by the prince of the faeries was another entirely. <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he thought he heard the cheerful lilt of pipes and flutes dance across the silence as he shut the door of the cottage for the night.
