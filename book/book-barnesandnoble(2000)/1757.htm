In his 1996 bestseller, <I>Leading Change,</I> he laid out a revolutionary eight-step process that organizations can use to facilitate successful change. Here, he and coauthor Dan S. Cohen reveal the results of their detailed research into more than 100 organizations in the midst of pervasive change. Both exciting and instructive, these true stories are certain to strike a responsive chords in manager/readers. Solid advice for the great leap forward.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>"Never underestimate the power of a good story," Kotter and  Cohen testify in this highly readable sequel to Kotter's  groundbreaking Leading Change. Practicing what they preach, they  have culled, from hundreds of interviews conducted by Deloitte  Consulting, the 34 most instructive and vivid accounts of  companies undergoing large-scale change. With chapters organized  by each of the eight stages of change Kotter identified in his  1996 bestseller, the authors deftly contrast success stories  with fumbles, then utilize the compare-and-contrast format for  lively "how-to/how-not-to" discussion. Throughout, they pepper  their discussion with arresting (and quotable) aphorisms, such  as "Dying will not help" and "Honesty always trumps propaganda,"  to ensure that readers remain on task, engaged and awake. Viewed  in stages with concrete examples and convenient end-of-chapter  summaries, the challenges and opportunities of the change  process emerge in sharp relief. Kotter and Cohen demonstrate the  critical difference that focus, faith, leadership, commitment  and creativity make in winning employees' hearts, offering good  stories that truly apply to each topic. "The single biggest  challenge in the process is changing people's behavior," they  insist, while providing convincing evidence (as well as examples  of the effectiveness of videos and creative visual displays)  that their method of "see-feel-change" will enable a company to  overcome resistance lurking in its midst. (Aug. 1) Forecast: Author appearances and a national marketing and  advertising campaign will alert Leading Change's huge audience  (it is HBS Press's all-time bestseller) to this practical  no-nonsense guide that pumps up, orients and keeps on track  companies struggling with change.

											By interviewing 400 individuals from 130 businesses to get their change sagas, authors John P. Kotter and Dan S. Cohen further anchor the fresh approach to organizational change that Kotter presented in 'Leading Change' (1996). Their main insight: organizations change when their people change. And, people change for emotional reasons. Some readers may think that the emphasis on feelings is 'soft' or even 'distracting,' but the authors warn against relying on spreadsheets or reports to promote transformation. They insist that the best way to engage the emotions is not to 'tell' but to 'show' - in videos, displays or even office design. The visual sense, they point out, processes enormous amounts of complex information instantly. At the end of each chapter, the authors include useful, modestly titled, 'Exercises That Might Help.' With appreciation for that level of detail, we recommend this illuminating book. Kotter has presented his eight-step change model before, but this practical, compact work demonstrates - with plainspoken stories of real-life managers and companies - how it functions. Thus the form of the book - 'showing' - exactly replicates its main point.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Critically acclaimed author John P. Kotter has developed a groundbreaking paradigm for implementing change that places emphasis on the critical link between workplace behavior and an individual's feelings about his or her job.</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>John Kotter's international bestseller <I>Leading Change</I> struck a powerful chord with legions of managers everywhere.

Cohen delve deeper into the subject of change to get to the heart of how change <I>actually happens</I>. Through compelling, real-life stories from people in the trenches, in all kinds of organizations, the authors attack the fundamental problem that underlies every major transformation&#58; How do you go beyond simply getting your message across to truly changing people's <I>behavior</I>?<P> <P>Based on interviews within over 100 organizations in the midst of large-scale change, <I>The Heart of Change</I> delivers the simple yet provocative answer to this question, forever altering the way organizations and individuals approach change. While most companies believe change happens by making people think differently, Kotter and Cohen say the key lies in making them <I>feel</I> differently. They introduce a new dynamic-"see-feel-change"-that fuels action by <I>showing</I> people potent reasons for change that spark their emotions. <P> <P>Organized around the revolutionary eight-step change process introduced in <I>Leading Change</I>, this story-driven book shows how the best change leaders use not just reports or analysis, but gloves, video cameras, airplanes, office design, and other concrete elements to impel people toward positive action. The authors reveal how this appeal to the heart-over the mind-motivates people to overcome even daunting obstacles to change and produce breathtaking results. <P> <P>For individuals in every walk of life and companies in every stage of change, this compact, no-nonsense book captures the heart-and the how-of successful change. <P> <P>Author Biography&#58; John P.

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Prolific author and change management expert Kotter (emeritus,  Harvard Business Sch.) and consultant Cohen join forces in this  timely update to Kotter's successful Leading Change (1996),  which set the standard for books on the subject. This earlier  work revealed why efforts at change so often end in failure and  outlined the eight critical steps needed to turn things around.  Having researched more than 100 organizations in the midst of  major changes, Kotter and Cohen now reveal the core problems  people face at each of these eight stages and provide  straightforward solutions. Their main finding is that the  central issue concerns not structure or systems but changing the  behavior of people. An overview of how people see and meet  change is followed by chapters on the steps to successful,  large-scale change, including increasing urgency, building a  guiding team, getting the vision right, communicating for  buy-in, empowering action, creating short-term wins, and  persistence. The inclusion of many firsthand, personal stories  from people involved in change efforts makes this a useful book  for any organization.

</p><h3>Soundview Executive Book Summaries</h3><p>If you have ever tried to change anything, you know how hard it is. How do you go about getting your message across to truly change people's behavior? While most companies believe change happens by making people think differently, according to John Kotter and Dan Cohen, this is not the case. Instead, the authors write that change happens when you make people feel differently.<p>They write that those who want to promote change must appeal more to the heart than the mind.</p> <p>The authors write that people change what they do because they are shown a truth that influences their feelings. This is especially so in large-scale organizational change, where you are dealing with new technologies, cultural transformation, globalization and e-business. In an age of turbulence, when you handle this reality well, the authors explain, you win.</p> <p>To understand why some organizations are leaping into the future more successfully than others, the authors write that companies first need to see the flow of effective large-scale change efforts. Change is an eight-step process that few handle well. These steps are: <ol><li>Create a sense of urgency so that people start telling each other, "Let's go, we need to change things!" In successful change efforts, the first step is making sure sufficient people act with sufficient urgency - with on-your-toes behavior that looks for opportunities and problems and energizes colleagues, that beams a sense of "let's go." Without urgency, large-scale change will not happen.</li> <li>Pull together a guiding team powerful enough to guide a big change. The team you put together to guide change needs a sense of urgency. When there is urgency, more people want to lead, even if there is personal risk and few short-term rewards. But urgency isn't enough. Large-scale change does not happen without a powerful guiding force. A fragmented management team cannot do the job, and a hero CEO does not work either. There are not enough hours in the day for even the strongest executive to accomplish change single-handedly. Your challenge is to put together an effective guiding team.</li> <li>Create clear, simple, uplifting visions and sets of strategies. In successful large-scale change, a well-functioning guiding team answers the questions required to produce a clear sense of direction. What change is necessary? What is our vision for the new organization? What should not be altered? What is the best way to make the vision a reality? What change strategies are unacceptably dangerous? Good answers to these questions position an organization to leap into a better future.</li> <li>Communicate the vision through simple, heartfelt messages sent through multiple channels so that people begin to buy into the change. In successful change efforts, the visions and change strategies can't stay locked in a room with your team. They must be communicated with as many people as possible, who in turn must buy in. The goal: to get as many people as possible acting to make the vision a reality.</li> <li>Empower people by removing obstacles to the vision. When people begin to understand and act on a change vision, you need to remove barriers in their paths. One example: Take away a pessimistic skipper and give the crew an optimistic boss. Often the biggest obstacle to change efforts is a boss - an immediate manager or someone higher in the hierarchy. Subordinates see the vision and want to help, but are effectively shut down.</li> <li>Create short-term wins that provide momentum. Empowered people create short-term wins -- victories that nourish faith in the change effort, emotionally reward the hard workers, keep the critics at bay, and build momentum. Without early wins that are visible, timely, unambiguous and meaningful, change efforts invariably run into serious problems.</li> <li>Maintain momentum so that wave after wave of change is possible. After the first set of short-term wins, a change effort will have direction and momentum. In successful situations, people build on this momentum to make a vision a reality by keeping urgency up and a feeling of false pride down; by eliminating unnecessary, exhausting and demoralizing work; and by not declaring victory prematurely.</li> <li>Make change stick by nurturing a new culture. Tradition is a powerful force. Leaps into the future can slide back into the past. Change sticks only if you create a new, supportive and strong organizational culture. A supportive culture provides roots for new ways of working. Making it stick is difficult. If this challenge isn't met at the end of the change-process, enormous effort can be wasted.</li></ol></p> <p><i>Why Soundview Likes This Book</i><br> <i>The Heart of Change</i> reveals a new dynamic - the "see-feel-change" dynamic that fuels action by showing people potent reasons for change that spark their emotions.

</div><a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><i>Introduction</i><P>The Heart of Change </i><P> The single most important message in this book is very simple. People change what they do less because they are given <I>analysis</I> that shifts their <I>thinking</I> than because they are <I>shown</I> a truth that influences their feelings. This is especially so in large-scale organizational change, where you are dealing with new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, new strategies, cultural transformation, globalization, and e-business-whether in an entire organization, an office, a department, or a work group. In an age of turbulence, when you handle this reality well, you win. Handle it poorly, and it can drive you crazy, cost a great deal of money, and cause a lot of pain. <P> The lessons here come from two sets of interviews, the first completed seven years ago, the second within the last two years. About 400 people from 130 organizations answered our questions. We found, in brief, that<P> �       Highly successful organizations know how to overcome antibodies that reject anything new. They know how to grab opportunities and avoid hazards. They see that <I>bigger leaps</I> are increasingly associated with winning big. They see that continuous gradual improvement, by itself, is no longer enough. <P> �       Successful large-scale change is a complex affair that happens in <I>eight stages</I>. The flow is this: push urgency up, put together a guiding team, create the vision and strategies, effectively communicate the vision and strategies, remove barriers to action, accomplish short-term wins, keep pushing for wave after wave of change until the work is done, and, finally, create a new culture to make new behavior stick. <P> �       The central challenge in all eight stages is <I>changing people's behavior</I>. The central challenge is not strategy, not systems, not culture. These elements and many others can be very important, but the core problem without question is behavior-what people do, and the need for significant shifts in what people do. <P> �       Changing behavior is less a matter of giving people analysis to influence their thoughts than helping them to see a truth <I>to influence their feelings</I>. Both thinking and feeling are essential, and both are found in successful organizations, but the heart of change is in the emotions. The flow of see-feel-change is more powerful than that of analysis-think-change. These distinctions between seeing and analyzing, between feeling and thinking, are critical because, for the most part, we use the latter much more frequently, competently, and comfortably than the former. <P> When we are frustrated, we sometimes try to convince ourselves there is a decreasing need for large-scale change. But powerful and unceasing forces are driving the turbulence. When frustrated, we sometimes think that problems are inevitable and out of our control. Yet some people handle large-scale change remarkably well. We can all learn from these people. CEOs can learn. First-line supervisors can learn. Nearly anyone caught up in a big change can learn. That's the point of this book. <P> <P> <i>The Eight Stages of Successful Large-Scale Change</i><P> To understand why some organizations are leaping into the future more successfully than others, you need first to see the flow of effective large-scale change efforts. In almost all cases, there is a flow, a set of eight steps that few people handle well. <P> <P> <i>Step 1</i><P> Whether at the top of a large private enterprise or in small groups at the bottom of a nonprofit, those who are most successful at significant change begin their work by creating a sense of </I>urgency</I> among relevant people. In smaller organizations, the "relevant" are more likely to number 100 than 5, in larger organizations 1,000 rather than 50. The less successful change leaders aim at 5 or 50 or 0, allowing what is common nearly everywhere-too much complacency, fear, or anger, all three of which can undermine change. A sense of urgency, sometimes developed by very creative means, gets people off the couch, out of a bunker, and ready to move. <P> <P> <i>Step 2</i><P> With urgency turned up, the more successful change agents pull together a <I>guiding team</I> with the credibility, skills, connections, reputations, and formal authority required to provide change leadership. This group learns to operate as do all good teams, with trust and emotional commitment. The less successful rely on a single person or no one, weak task forces and committees, or complex governance structures, all without the stature and skills and power to do the job. The landscape is littered with task forces ill equipped to produce needed change. <P> <P> <i>Step 3</i><P> In the best cases, the guiding team creates sensible, clear, simple, uplifting <I>visions</I> and sets of strategies. In the less successful cases, there are only detailed plans and budgets that, although necessary, are insufficient, or a vision that is not very sensible in light of what is happening in the world and in the enterprise, or a vision that is created by others and largely ignored by the guiding team. In unsuccessful cases, strategies are often too slow and cautious for a faster-moving world. <P> <P> <i>Step 4</i><P> <I>Communication</I> of the vision and strategies comes next-simple, heartfelt messages sent through many unclogged channels. The goal is to induce understanding, develop a gut-level commitment, and liberate more energy from a critical mass of people. Here, deeds are often more important than words. Symbols speak loudly. Repetition is key. In the less successful cases, there is too little effective communication, or people hear words but don't accept them. Remarkably, smart people undercommunicate or poorly communicate all the time without recognizing their error. <P> <P> <i>Step 5</i><P> In the best situations, you find a heavy dose of <I>empowerment</I>. Key obstacles that stop people from acting on the vision are removed. Change leaders focus on bosses who disempower, on inadequate information and information systems, and on self-confidence barriers in people's minds. The issue here is removing obstacles, not "giving power." You can't hand out power in a bag. In less successful situations, people are often left to fend for themselves despite impediments all around. So frustration grows, and change is undermined. <P> <P> <i>Step 6</i><P> With empowered people working on the vision, in cases of great success those people are helped to produce <I>short-term wins</I>. The wins are critical. They provide credibility, resources, and momentum to the overall effort. In other cases, the wins come more slowly, less visibly, speak less to what people value, and have more ambiguity as to whether they really are successes. Without a well-managed process, careful selection of initial projects, and fast enough successes, the cynics and skeptics can sink any effort. <P> <P> <i>Step 7</i><P> In the best cases, change leaders <I>don't let up</I>. Momentum builds after the first wins. Early changes are consolidated. People shrewdly choose what to tackle next, then create wave after wave of change until the vision is a reality. In less successful cases, people try to do too much at once. They unwittingly quit too soon. They let momentum slip to the point where they find themselves hopelessly bogged down. <P> <P> <i>Step 8</i><P> Finally, in the best cases, change leaders throughout organizations <I>make change stick</I> by nurturing a new culture. A new culture-group norms of behavior and shared values-develops through consistency of successful action over a sufficient period of time. Here, appropriate promotions, skillful new employee orientation, and events that engage the emotions can make a big difference. In other cases, changes float fragile on the surface. A great deal of work can be blown away by the winds of tradition in a remarkably short period of time. <P> <P> <i>The Flow of Change</i><P> The process of change involves subtle points regarding overlapping stages, guiding teams at multiple levels in the organization, handling multiple cycles of change, and more. Because the world is complex, some cases do not rigidly follow the eight-step flow. But the eight steps are the basic pattern associated with significant useful change-all possible <I>despite</I> an inherent organizational inclination not to leap successfully into a better future. <P> Evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the most fundamental problem in all of the stages is changing the behavior of people. The core issue in step 1 is not urgency in some abstract sense. The core issue is the behavior of people who are ignoring how the world is changing, who are frozen in terror by the problems they see, or who do little but bitterly complain. In step 2, the issue is the behavior of those in a position to guide change-especially regarding trust and commitment. In step 3, the core challenge is for people to start acting in a way that will create sensible visions and strategies. For people who know how to plan but have never devised a winning change vision, this behavior change is very big. In step 4, the issue is getting sufficient people to buy into the vision via communication. In step 5, it's acting on that communication-which for some employees will mean doing their jobs in radically new ways. And so on throughout the process. <P> <P> <i>See, Feel, Change</i><P> Significantly changing the behavior of a single person can be exceptionally difficult work. Changing 101 or 10,001 people can be a Herculean task. Yet organizations that are leaping into the future succeed at doing just that. Look carefully at how they act and you'll find another pattern. They succeed, regardless of the stage in the overall process, because their most central activity does not center on formal data gathering, analysis, report writing, and presentations-the sorts of actions typically aimed at changing thinking in order to change behavior. Instead, they compellingly <I>show</I> people what the problems are and how to resolve the problems. They provoke responses that reduce feelings that slow and stifle needed change, and they enhance feelings that motivate useful action. The emotional reaction then provides the energy that propels people to push along the change process, no matter how great the difficulties. <P> The stories presented throughout the book clarify this pattern, showing what can be done to enable the process. In chapter 1 (which deals with urgency), a procurement manager starts a needed change by creating a dramatic presentation. On the boardroom table he piles 424 different kinds of gloves that the firm is currently buying for its workers at dozens of different prices for the same glove and from dozens of different suppliers. First people are shocked, then the gut-level sense of complacency shrinks and urgency grows. It's not just a matter of the data saying that changes are necessary in the purchasing process so people alter their behavior. Instead, it's subtler and deeper. It's a loud sound that catches attention in a day filled with thousands of words and dozens of events. It's an image, hard to shake, that evokes a feeling that we must <I>do</I> something. <P> In chapter 2 (guiding team), the army officer doesn't pull together his new change team with a rational argument. Instead, he shocks them by taking a risk for the greater good with his comments in a meeting. He then helps them begin to tell emotion-packed stories around a campfire. More positive feelings and trust grow, making them act as an effective team. <P> The aircraft plant manager in chapter 3 (vision and strategies) ceases to just talk to his people about developing ambitious strategies to fit an ambitious quality vision. Instead, he takes dramatic action. He stops the normal production process-just stops it-so everyone must stare all day long at a gigantic plane that can no longer move along the production line. At the same time, he expresses a rock-solid belief that they can find a way to improve quality without delaying delivery. After the initial shock, and with his continuously upbeat behavior, employees begin developing all sorts of new strategies for leaping ahead in procurement, logistics, and quality control. <P> In chapter 4 (communication), people logically explain why maintaining a lush executive floor is cost-effective in an age of cutbacks-the logic being that it would cost more to change the architecture and d�cor to make it look less excessive. But that communication convinces few employees and allows cynicism to grow. So they "nuke" the floor, making it less regal, and shock employees in a way that increases their faith in top management and their belief in the vision. <P> In chapter 5 (empowerment), managers refuse to demote, fire, or "retrain" someone who is staunchly against change and who disempowers others from helping with change. Instead they loan him to a customer, where he is dramatically confronted each day with the problems the customer is having with his products. What he sees generates shock, then feelings that help the man rise to the occasion. He returns to his employer a manager reborn. Approaching his job in a whole new way, he helps the firm make changes that benefit customers, employees, and owners. <P> In chapter 6 (short-term wins), a manager does not ignore an influential state Senator or sell him on a change effort's progress with graphs and charts. Instead, the manager finds out what the Senator really cares about. Then he dramatically reduces the number of ridiculous, bureaucratic forms needed to be filled out in that area. He shows the Senator the result, surprising the man in the most positive sense. As a result, the Senator begins actively supporting the change effort. In chapter 7 (not letting up), a task force knows top management behavior is slowing down the change process. But instead of ducking the issue, or trying to describe it in antiseptic terms, the task force creates a hilarious video with actors spoofing the problem. The amusing, nonconfrontational video gives those executives trying to create change a much-needed tool for legitimizing new top management behavior. <P> In chapter 8 (making change stick), staff write a good speech about the values the firm has created and needs to strengthen and retain if their transformation is to be firmly entrenched. But the real power comes when they present a real customer to employees. He tells an inspirational story showing the consequences of living those values. <P> Stories like these reveal a core pattern associated with successful change. 1.      <i>SEE</i>.-People find a problem in some stage of the change process-too many of their colleagues are behaving complacently, no one is developing a sensible strategy, too many are letting up before the strategy has been achieved. They then create dramatic, eye-catching, compelling situations that help others visualize the problem or a solution to the problem. <P> 2.      <i>FEEL</i>.-The visualizations awaken feelings that facilitate useful change or ease feelings that are getting in the way. Urgency, optimism, or faith may go up. Anger, complacency, cynicism, or fear may go down. <P> 3.      <i>CHANGE</i>.-The new feelings change or reinforce new behavior, sometimes very different behavior. People act much less complacently. They try much harder to make a good vision a reality. They don't stop before the work is done, even if the road seems long. <P> <P> Successful see-feel-change tactics tend to be clever, not clumsy, and never cynically manipulative. They often have an afterglow, where the story of the event is told again and again or where there is a remaining visible sign of the event that influences additional people over time. When done well over all eight stages of a change process, the results can be breathtaking. Mature (old-fashioned, clunky, or heavy) organizations take a leap into the future. Laggards start to become leaders. Leaders jump farther ahead. <P> <P> The point is not that careful data gathering, analysis, and presentation are unimportant. They are important. Sometimes it is behavior changed by analysis that sends people into a see-feel-change process. Sometimes change launched through feelings creates a radically better approach to analysis. Often small changes are a necessary part of a larger change effort, and the small changes are driven by analysis. Occasionally, careful analysis is required to get show-me-the-numbers finance people or engineers in the mood to see. <P> But analysis has at least three major limitations. First, in a remarkable number of cases, you don't need it to find the big truths. You may not need to do much work to find that the old strategy isn't working and that a new one isn't being embraced. You don't need a fifty-page report to see there is insufficient new product development and that a number of factors make it impossible for the engineers to do what is necessary. You don't need reams of financial data to learn that you cannot stay out of e-business and that the first step is simply to take the first step. It isn't necessary for a team of psychologists to study a person and his or her team to find out they are failing and must be replaced. Yes, there are many exceptions-deciding on which $100 million IT system to buy, for example-but the general point is valid. <P> Second, analytical tools have their limitations in a turbulent world. These tools work best when parameters are known, assumptions are minimal, and the future is not fuzzy. <P> Third, good analysis rarely motivates people in a big way. It changes thought, but how often does it send people running out the door to act in significantly new ways? And motivation is not a thinking word; it's a feeling word. <P> We fail at change efforts not because we are stupid, overcontrolled, and unemotional beings, although it can seem that way at times. We fail because we haven't sufficiently experienced highly successful change. Without that experience, we are too often left pessimistic, fearful, or without enough faith to act. So we not only behave in less effective ways, we don't even try. <P> Consider the implications of this pattern in an age of accelerating change, at a time when we are making a mind-boggling transition from an industrial to an information/knowledge economy. Consider the implications in light of how managers, management educators, and others today deal with large-scale change. <P> Of course there are many difficulties here, but being uninformed and pessimistic does not help. We need more leaps into the future. And although we are becoming better at this, there is no reason that we cannot learn to become much better still. <P> In light of the stakes, we must become better still. <P> <P> <i>Using the Book</i><P> Because they help <I>show</I>, the stories in the book are very important. As a reader, glancing at the figures, reading a bit of the text, and moving on does not work especially well. If you are in a rush and want to learn from the book quickly, read three or four stories and look at the end-of-chapter figures. You might choose the stories in whichever chapter seems of most relevance. Or  you might go to "Gloves on the Boardroom Table" in the step 1 chapter, "The Plane Will Not Move!" in the step 3 chapter, and "Retooling the Boss" in the step 5 chapter. <P> No matter how you read the book, feel free to copy a story and send it to your colleagues.  The more a relevant story circulates among your colleagues, and the more it creates useful dialogue, the better. <P> In a recent edition of <I>Fortune</I> magazine, Jack Welch is quoted as saying, "You've got to talk about change every second of the day." That's a bit of an extreme position, but maybe extreme is what wins. <P> <P> Excerpted from, <I>The Heart of Change: Real-Life Stories of How People Change Their Organizations</I>, by John P.
