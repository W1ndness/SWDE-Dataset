In a world that seems too often stingy and grudging, she has witnessed how one simple act of generosity can yield unforeseen miracles. <P>You are about to discover, through true stories, what happens when we commit intentional acts of generosity. Lives are changed in ways we never envisioned. Come with Debbie late one evening through the checkout line at the grocery store. Visit a midwestern train station. Discover the link between a submarine, a few bread crumbs, and some minnows. Visit ancient Galilee as a young boy volunteers his fishes and loaves to Jesus only to see his meager gift multiplied many times over to feed five thousand. Listen in on a touching phone call with an elderly widow. You will stand amazed at what God accomplishes when we make ourselves available through simple acts of generosity.<P>This blend of true stories and motivating messages will delight and surprise you as you discover how giving the gifts of time, encouragement, hope, laughter, prayer, hospitality, service, and even forgiveness can have lasting, life-changing impact, not only on the recipient of such gifts but on the giver as well.<P>Debbie Macomber, through the power of story, invites us to live with open hands, offering who we are and what we have to God, to use in the lives of others. When we do so, lives&#151;including our own&#151;are changed in ways we couldn't have imagined. All it takes is one simple act.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Macomber, one of today&rsquo;s leading fiction writers with more than 100 million books in print, walks a new path with this nonfiction title. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to share the news,&rdquo; she says of her book on generosity. &ldquo;Intentional acts of generosity can open our lives to the very best God has to offer.&rdquo; Macomber builds her book on the biblical story of Jesus&rsquo; multiplication of five loaves and two fishes, a miracle recorded in all four gospels, using her storytelling prowess to retell the tale. She then takes readers on a journey through the true meaning of generosity (and it&rsquo;s not about cash)&#58; encouragement, good deeds, forgiveness and believing the best. She also delves into giving, listening and hospitality, and dips into what generosity means when it comes to Christmas, caregiving and prayer. The theme, Macomber says, is, simply, to offer what you have. She fills out her chapters with real-life stories, suggestions for &ldquo;Simple Acts&rdquo; and brief &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; sections. This is a useful, inspiring study of an underpracticed art, written by one who has received, given and witnessed generosity. (Nov.)

When Macomber decided to follow her dreams of becoming a bestselling novelist, she had a lot of obstacles in her path. For starters, Macomber is dyslexic. On top of this, she had only a high school degree, four young children at home, and absolutely no connections in the publishing world. If there's one thing you can say about Debbie Macomber, however, it is that she does not give up. She rented a typewriter and started writing, determined to break into the world of romance fiction.   <P>The years went on and the rejection letters piled up. Her family was living on a shoestring budget, and Debbie was beginning to think that her dreams of being a novelist might never be fulfilled. She began writing for magazines to earn some extra money, and she eventually saved up enough to attend a romance writer's conference with three hundred other aspiring novelists. The organizers of the conference picked ten manuscripts to review in a group critique session. Debbie was thrilled to learn that her manuscript would be one of the novels discussed.   <P>Her excitement quickly faded when an editor from Harlequin tore her manuscript to pieces in front of the crowded room, evoking peals of laughter from the assembled writers. Afterwards, Macomber approached the editor and asked her what she could do to improve her novel. "Throw it away," the editor suggested.   <P>Many writers would have given up right then and there, but not Macomber. The deeply religious Macomber took a lesson from Job and gathered strength from adversity. She returned home and mailed one last manuscript to Silhouette, a publisher of romance novels. "It cost $10 to mail it off," Macomber told the <I>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</I> in 2000. "My husband was out of work at this time, in Alaska, trying to find a job. The children and I were living on his $250-a-week unemployment, and I can't tell you what $10 was to us at that time."   <P>It turned out to be the best $10 Macomber ever spent. In 1984, Silhouette published her novel, <I>Heartsong</I>. (Incidentally, although <I>Heartsong</I>  was Macomber's first sale, she actually published another book, <I>Starlight</I>, before <I>Heartsong</I> went to print.) <I>Heartsong</I> went on to become the first romance novel to ever be reviewed in <I>Publishers Weekly</I>, and Macomber was finally on her way.  <P>Today, Macomber is one of the most widely read authors in America. A regular on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller charts,  she is best known for her Cedar Cove novels, a heartwarming story sequence set in a small town in Washington state, and for her Knitting Books series, featuring a group of women who patronize a Seattle yarn store. In addition, her backlist of early romances, including several contemporary Westerns, has been reissued with great success.  <P>Macomber has made a successful transition from conventional romance to the somewhat more flexible genre known as "women's fiction." "I was at a point in my life where I found it difficult to identify with a 25-year-old heroine," Macomber said in an interview with ContemporaryRomanceWriters.com. "I found that I wanted to write more about the friendships women share with each other." To judge from her avid, ever-increasing fan base, Debbie's readers heartily approve.</P></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some outtakes from our interview with Macomber:</I> <p>  <b>"I'm dyslexic, although they didn't have a word for it</b> when I was in grade school. The teachers said I had 'word blindness.' I've always been a creative speller and never achieved good grades in school. I graduated from high school but didn't have the opportunity to attend college, so I did what young women my age did at the time -- I married. I was a teenager, and Wayne and I (now married nearly 37 years) had four children in five years."<p>    <b>"I'm a yarnaholic. That means I have more yarn stashed away</b> than any one person could possibly use in three or four lifetimes. There's something inspiring about yarn that makes me feel I could never have enough. Often I'll go into my yarn room (yes, room!) and just hold skeins of yarn and dream about projects. It's a comforting thing to do."<p>    <b>"My office walls are covered with autographs of famous writers</b> -- it's what my children call my �dead author wall.' I have signatures from Mark Twain, Earnest Hemingway, Jack London, Harriett Beecher Stowe, Pearl Buck, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, to name a few."  <p>     <b>"I'm morning person, and rip into the day with a half-mile swim</b> (FYI: a half mile is a whole lot farther in the water than it is on land) at the local pool before I head into the office, arriving before eight. It takes me until nine or ten to read through all of the guest book entries from my web site and the mail before I go upstairs to the turret where I do my writing. Yes, I write in a turret -- is that romantic, or what? I started blogging last September and really enjoy sharing bits and pieces of my life with my readers. Once I'm home for the day, I cook dinner, trying out new recipes. Along with cooking, I also enjoy eating, especially when the meal is accompanied by a glass of good wine. Wayne and I take particular pleasure in sampling eastern Washington State wines (since we were both born and raised in that part of the state). <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the spring of 2005, Debbie Macomber took some time out to answer our questions.</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  The one book that has had the strongest influence on my life, without question, is the Bible. God's Word has been the guiding force behind all I do. I read the Bible each and every day and gain inspiration, encouragement, and joy.  <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  Before I answer this, I feel it's necessary to mention that I read widely, across the board.  In compiling this list I discovered several of my favorite books are nonfiction. I have not noted the Bible a second time, although as I indicated above, it is the most influential book in my life. <p>    <li><I>Charms for the Easy Life</I> by Kaye Gibbons -- For its charm, its wonderful writing, and its truth. (I introduced this book to my editor, who now loves Kaye Gibbons's work as much as I do.) <p>    <li><I>And Then There Was Light</I> by Jacques Lusseyran -- I read this book shortly after learning that my father had been a POW in WWII, something he never talked about until the end of his life. It helped me understand some of what he endured and gave me a deep appreciation of the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation. <p>    <li><I>The Power of Positive Thinking</I> by Norman Vincent Peale -- When I first decided to write, I knew I was going to need all the positive reinforcement I could get. I read and reread Dr. Peale's wonderful words of wisdom. After I published my first book, I wrote Dr. Peale to thank him for his inspiration, and he wrote me back. It is a letter I will always treasure. <p>    <li><I>The Wolf and the Dove</I> by Kathleen E.  Woodiwiss -- I loved and read this historical romance so often that I had the first page nearly memorized. Kathleen Woodiwiss opened my eyes to the possibilities of fiction. These characters felt real to me. I cheered and cried with them and never wanted the book to end. I first read this book in the early 1980s and knew from that moment on that I wanted my readers to feel the same way when they finished one of my books.   <p>    <li><I>Why Good Girls Don't Get Ahead but Gutsy Girls Do</I> by Kate White -- This business-related book taught me that I'm a gutsy girl in a good-girl disguise. It offers some of the soundest career advice I've read. <p>    <li><I>The 21 Immutable Laws of Marketing</I> by Al Ries and Jack Trout -- Another wonderful business book that is  full of interesting tidbits about the buying public, their buying habits and how best to market to them. <p>    <li><I>The Notorious Rake</I> by Mary Balogh -- I'm a real fan of Regency romances, and I consider this one of the best.  I read this book in one sitting, unable to put it down. <p>    <li><I>The 13th Juror</I> by John Lescroart -- This is one of the best-plotted and most interesting books I've read in ages, and I have recommended it again and again. John is a wonderful writer, and we discovered that we have a great deal in common, including the fact that both our fathers were POWs in WWII. <p>    <li><I>If Ever I Return, Pretty Peggy-O</I> by Sharyn McCrumb -- My editor recommended this author to me and commented that she envied me the experience of reading my first Sharyn McCrumb. (This book is the first of her Ballad series, all set in Appalachia.) Later I was fortunate enough to meet Sharyn at a writers' conference, so I could tell her how much I enjoyed her work. <p>    <li><I>Walking After Midnight</I> by Karen Robards -- This book was pure fun. I felt as though I was on a roller-coaster ride, and every page was a thrill.  <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  I'm a big film buff, although I'm not fond of movies with excessive violence. I've always enjoyed musicals. My first exposure was with <I>West Side Story</I>. I memorized all the songs and belted them out for months afterward. I almost entered the convent after watching <I>The Sound of Music</I>. Thankfully, I didn't; it wouldn't have been a good fit for either of us. In recent years I've enjoyed <I>The Princess Bride</I> and the <I>Star Wars</I> series. I like movies with what I call a zinger -- <I>Collateral</I> and <i>The Replacement Killers</I> are good examples. And comedies, too.  I don't think I've ever laughed so hard as when I watched <I>The Gods Must Be Crazy</I>, <I>It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World</I>, and <I>The Hallelujah Trail</I>. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I don't listen to music while writing. It's not that I need silence in order to create. I started out writing when our four children were small and I needed to keep my ears tuned to them in case one of them decided to play Superman and fly out a window or start a campfire in the middle of the living room. When it comes to listening to the radio, I prefer the oldies stations. When I'm on the treadmill, I play Christian CDs and make a joyful noise. Correction: It's a joyful noise to me, but I doubt others would think so.  <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  There's a bookstore directly below my office. It's hard to believe but I write above a bookstore <I>and</I> an ice cream parlor. This, my friends, is a writer's nirvana. On average I buy a book a day, and that's no exaggeration. Mostly I purchase nonfiction for gifts. One of my favorites is <I>Gifts from the Sea</I> by Anne Morrow Lindberg. For my writer friends I've bought <I>Goals</I> by Brian Tracy, and for friends who are animal lovers I've bought <I>The Dog Who Rescues Cats</I> by Gonzalez & Fleischer. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I have a cherrywood desk with a glass top to protect the wood. Over the years a number of things have made their way under the glass. There's a picture of my dad and his brother, who looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for identical twins -- only my dad was a full foot shorter than his brother. Then there are pictures of my grandchildren (by far the cutest grandkids in the universe), and there's a slip of paper on which I've written four words. They are:  "provocative," "relevant," "creative," and "honest." When I decide on a plot for one of my big hardcover stories, I weigh the story against each of these words. I want to provoke my readers to think. I want the story to be relevant to them and to our times. My goal is to tell this story in as creative a way as possible and to be honest with my readers and with myself. As you might have guessed, I'm a lover of words. As for rituals, I really don't have any.  <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  In my humble opinion, there are a lot of writers out there who haven't suffered enough. I suffered plenty. When I first started writing, I didn't know another writer in the world. This was back in the late 1970s before Romance Writers of America was formed. For nearly five years I wrote and submitted my manuscripts. My work was rejected so fast it practically hit me in the back of the head on my way home from the post office. At one point in my lonely sojourn, an editor read and reviewed my manuscript, and with the utmost sincerity told me there was no use in revising it and the best thing I could do was <I>throw it away</I>. Thankfully, I didn't take her advice, because that <I>same</I> manuscript sold to a rival publishing house and launched my writing career. <p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  I would suggest that writers pay close attention to the market -- read the bestsellers, analyze each story and look for the key element that is drawing an audience. Who would ever have imagined that <I>Life of Pi</I> by Yann Martel would command the audience it has? Or <I>The Da Vinci Code</I>? As writers, it's important we not <I>follow</I> trends but observe and understand life -- and start our own. It was when I saw a lot of angel figurines turning up in catalogs that I wrote the first Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy Christmas book.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>What if you, personally, could make the world a better place...by tomorrow?<P>Debbie Macomber knows the secret to doing exactly that!

</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Macomber, one of today&rsquo;s leading fiction writers with more than 100 million books in print, walks a new path with this nonfiction title. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to share the news,&rdquo; she says of her book on generosity. &ldquo;Intentional acts of generosity can open our lives to the very best God has to offer.&rdquo; Macomber builds her book on the biblical story of Jesus&rsquo; multiplication of five loaves and two fishes, a miracle recorded in all four gospels, using her storytelling prowess to retell the tale. She then takes readers on a journey through the true meaning of generosity (and it&rsquo;s not about cash)&#58; encouragement, good deeds, forgiveness and believing the best. She also delves into giving, listening and hospitality, and dips into what generosity means when it comes to Christmas, caregiving and prayer. The theme, Macomber says, is, simply, to offer what you have. She fills out her chapters with real-life stories, suggestions for &ldquo;Simple Acts&rdquo; and brief &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; sections. This is a useful, inspiring study of an underpracticed art, written by one who has received, given and witnessed generosity. (Nov.)

Just one quick stop at the grocery store and she'd be on the way home to cuddle up with her new book in front of a warm fire.<P>As she waited at the traffic light to turn into the grocery store lot, she took off one glove to feel if the air blasting out of the heat vents was starting to warm. Ah, yes. What a relief. In the few minutes it had taken her to get from her bookstore to the grocery store, her fingers had started to ache from the cold. "I think I was born with cold fingers," she muttered. The light changed to green, and as she turned into the lot she came alongside a narrow median strip and noticed a man holding a crudely made hand-lettered cardboard sign&#58; <small>HOMELESS. NEED FOOD. PLEASE HELP.</small> At his feet was a small white plastic bucket. His collar was pulled high against the cold, but her eyes went to his hands holding the sign. Bare hands.<P><i>My fingers ache from five minutes in this cold car, with gloves on. How cold must his be?</i> she wondered. Her eyes went to his face. <i>Late twenties, probably six or seven years older than Mark.</i> The sudden thought of her son instantly made her shoulders sag. She hadn't seen Mark since summer. Addicted to drugs, Mark had left home several months ago after a two-year struggle &#151; maybe war was a better word &#151; with his parents over his drug abuse. He still called sometimes, but he'd beenbunking with friends, house hopping, and he'd even slept on the streets rather than come back home. Never had she felt so helpless as she'd felt watching her son self-destruct during these past two years, never so powerless to meet the deep needs of the son she loved. But he wasn't ready to give up his drugs or his illusion of freedom. He remained elusive about his whereabouts and declined every offer Kate made to meet him someplace to talk. <i>Where is he tonight? Cold and hungry like this guy? Begging on some street corner? And if a kind stranger gives him a ten-dollar bill, he'll buy his next hit of pills before buying a warm meal.</i> Kate's heart sank. <i>Are Mark's hands cold tonight?</i><P>And then it came to her. A quiet nudge. She parked, hurried into the store to pick up bread, eggs, and some yogurt for the weekend, then hit one more aisle. Through the checkout, a dash back to her car, and back along the other side of the median strip, where she pulled alongside the young man, rolled down her window, and stopped. Her heart picked up its pace. He walked over to her car, bucket held out, but she didn't hand any money out the window. Instead she held out a warm pair of gloves she'd just bought. He looked startled.<P>"Your hands must be terribly cold," she said. "I hope these help." The young man looked confused for a moment, then accepted the gloves. "Thanks," he said.<P>The car behind her honked and she pulled away and moved toward the intersection. She glanced in the rearview mirror and saw him pulling on the gloves. She blinked to clear a few tears away. They were warm on her cold cheeks, but another warmth from somewhere in her core was spreading upward, and she found herself smiling.<P>For the first time in a long time she didn't feel powerless at the thought of Mark. <i>Take care of my son tonight, Lord,</i> she prayed. <i>Show him Your love through the kindness of a stranger. And Lord, comfort the mother of that young man tonight.</i><P>In that one simple act Kate had discovered the power of generosity. She'd not only warmed a troubled young man, she'd kindled a spark of hope for Mark. And she realized that God had just used her to care for the son of another worried mother. Who knows, maybe the young man on the median strip called his mother that night.<P>Just one simple act.<b><P><i>A Discovery Worth Sharing</i></b><P>You've read the subtitle of this book, <i>Discovering the Power of Generosity</i>. If you recognized my name on the cover of the book you may be asking yourself why a writer known for fiction is writing a nonfiction book on generosity. The answer is...well...if you don't mind me quoting the title...<i>simple</i>. Have you ever discovered something so great that you just had to tell your friends? You know, like a great little vacation spot you stumbled across while on a trip, or a new clothing store with affordable prices, great selection, and really stellar service? Maybe you've heard a speaker who had a huge impact on you or saw a movie that made you laugh till you cried and you knew just the friend who needed it. When we find something we love, we want to share it with others and spread the joy. Right? That is how I feel about simple acts of generosity. I have had some encounters with generosity &#151; as the recipient, the giver, the witness &#151; that have had a profoundly life-changing impact on me. I've just got to share the news.<P>On the other hand, you may have seen the word "generosity" and thought to yourself, <i>Oh, great. One more appeal to go digging deep into my pocket.</i> Don't worry! You are not in for a brand-new load of guilt, I promise! That's precisely what this book is <i>not</i> about. In our age of overwork and exhaustion, tossing a few dollars here and there may be the easiest way to practice generosity. But I am talking about it in larger terms &#151; life-changing terms.<P>Like my friend Kate. She made a five-minute investment of time and on a whim probably spent about eight or nine dollars on that pair of gloves. But her decision had nothing to do with her wallet. It had to do with her heart. When she handed those gloves out the window she brought unexpected goodness into a bleak situation. And that goodness spilled over and gave back. It multiplied. For my friend Kate, that was just the beginning. But that is a story for another time.<P>When you pick up a book, it's fair to ask, "What's in it for me?" My goal in writing this is to surprise you with the multiple benefits that come from small and large acts of generosity. I'm convinced that we cannot become all we could be until we are willing to unclench our hands and release what we've been clinging to, what we've been determined to keep for ourselves. The intriguing part is that once we release such gifts we are free to take hold of something more, something better, something that God has wanted to give us for a very long time.<P>Simply put, intentional acts of generosity can open our lives to the very best God has to offer. In fact, the very best that God has to offer is exactly where we need to start.<b><i><P>A Tradition Worth Keeping</i></b><P>Several years ago I read of the old Quaker tradition of keeping a gratitude journal. I was inspired by the idea, so I purchased a book with blank pages and titled it <i>My Ode to Joy</i>. Each morning I wrote a little thank-you note to God. I found it to be a way to start my day on a positive note. Little did I understand then how the discipline of writing down five things for which I am thankful every day would forever change my life.<P>When I first started, I found it easy to hit the big things &#151; good parents, a wonderful husband, my children (and later my grandchildren), and, of course, a writing career I love. These precious gifts still make their way on to my list over and over. Today, when I reread journals from past years I see that as the months, then years trickled by, I began to dig deeper for things to add to my list. As I matured in my understanding of how God works, it wasn't only the good things, the pleasant, "happy" gifts for which I expressed appreciation. I began to see more clearly how God was using life's trials in unexpected ways for my good, so I began to write down my gratitude for the seemingly negative things in my life &#151; my troubles, pains, and losses. With that knowledge I became more confident that God would see me through everything, and my gratitude grew deeper. In fact, the greatest example of giving thanks for negative things can be found in Corrie ten Boom's book <i>The Hiding Place</i>.<b><i><P>Fleas, God's Secret Weapon</i></b><P>During World War II, Corrie and her sister Betsie had been arrested in Holland for trying to help Jews escape the Holocaust. They ended up in Ravensbr&#252;ck, one of the most infamous Nazi concentration camps. Their barracks had been built to hold 400 prisoners, but by the time the sisters arrived at the camp, the one-room building held more than 1,400 women.<P>Living conditions were insufferable. The women were housed like stacked cordwood on dirty, flea-infested straw that was strewn on wooden platforms. The fleas feasted night and day until everyone was covered in itchy, raised welts.<P>If it hadn't been for their Bible and the comfort the sisters were able to take from Betsie's readings, Corrie didn't know how they could have survived from day to day. If the guards had ventured into the room they would have discovered the forbidden Bible. Not only would it have been confiscated, but the consequences would have been brutal. Over and over, the two sisters wondered over the mystery of why the guards never inspected their barracks.<P>One morning Betsie read the Bible verse in 1 Thessalonians 5&#58;18 that said, "Give thanks in all circumstances." She insisted that they put this into practice, feeling certain that giving thanks was the answer to their suffering. As Corrie tells the story, her sister named a litany of things they needed to thank God for &#151; from the amazing circumstance that enabled the sisters to stay together, to the Bible she held in her hands, to the other women in the camp. But when Betsie began to thank God for the suffocating room and finally for the fleas, Corrie balked. It seemed impossible to Corrie to find anything for which to thank God in the deprivation of a concentration camp.<P>But Betsie insisted, reminding Corrie that God said, "In all circumstances." Corrie recalled standing in that room with all the other women, thanking God for the fleas and being certain that, for once, Betsie was wrong. Yet that prayer proved to be a turning point for the women. Their circumstances hadn't changed, but their attitude did. Betsie and Corrie began to connect with the women in a way that changed those barracks and the women imprisoned there. It wasn't until much later that Corrie discovered the reason the dreaded inspection never happened and their beloved Bible remained undiscovered. It was the very same reason she and Betsie were never stopped from having their much-anticipated Bible studies.<P>The fleas!<P>The guards refused to set foot into those barracks because of the out-of-control flea infestation. When Betsie took God at His word and thanked Him in all circumstances, she had no idea those fleas were actually a gift from God.<P>It's easy to be grateful for the sunshine, the good things, plenty of food, meeting the budget, and compliant children. But God tells us to express gratitude in <i>all</i> circumstances.<P>Think about it. That means we are called to offer thanks when the wind blows into our lives at hurricane force. We are asked to thank Him when the money runs out long before the end of the month and when the kids are pushing the boundaries and challenging us at every turn. It doesn't make any logical sense, does it?<P>Corrie ten Boom discovered the "sense" of giving thanks in all circumstances. She discovered the vital link between gratitude and <i>trust</i>. Through reading <i>The Hiding Place</i> and through the practice of keeping my own gratitude journal, I, too, have discovered this link. Though we may not understand the <i>whys</i> of our circumstances, by thanking God we grow to acknowledge that He is in control &#151; that He can be trusted. We learn to release our iron-tight grip on our circumstances, and we experience a much-welcome reprieve from worry.<P>The importance of giving thanks is made clear in Philippians 4&#58;6&#58; "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God." Interesting, isn't it? The antidote for anxiety is to pray <i>with thanksgiving.<P>Discovery<P>The act of gratitude reminds us that God is worthy of our trust.<br><b><P><i>Footsteps Worth Following</i></i></b><P>I admit learning to praise God in all circumstances takes practice. I find I need to be intentional and deliberate in doing so and make it a day-by-day, even minute-by-minute exercise. My grandparents, Anna and Anton Adler, were immigrants of German-Russian extraction who settled in the Dakotas. They were dirt farmers during the Great Depression of the 1930s. My grandparents rose long before dawn, greeting each day with anticipation. My grandfather labored in his fields only to see his crops fail year after year. When all seemed lost, he didn't give up. He looked toward the future. He heard of work picking fruit in the Yakima Valley in Washington State. Selling everything they had, my grandparents headed west with six children, leaving their two adult children behind, with their few remaining earthly possessions strapped to the back of their Model T Ford. They headed west, and without a backward glance, my grandfather left the farm behind. By all outward appearances he had failed just as the land had failed, and yet, as told in our family stories, my grandparents chose to thank God for the work ahead of them, rather than complain about what they had lost.<P>In the footsteps of my grandparents I, too, want to look at life with a sense of gratitude. I see my journal writing as starting my morning out on the positive note of practicing gratitude. Instead of grumbling over the drizzle outside my kitchen window, I can smile and remember that it's the rain that makes everything so green and lush in the Pacific Northwest.<P>I once read that there are more verses in the Bible that praise God than anything else. I'm not a Bible scholar, so I can't say for sure if that's true or not, but I do know that when we have a thankful heart, despite our circumstances, we lighten our load. Nothing jump-starts our gratitude like practicing the habit of praise. King David, who poured out his gratitude in verse after verse of the book of Psalms, was called a man after God's own heart. Isn't that what we'd like to be? Simply reading his psalms of praise is an ideal way to build gratitude into our lives.<b><i><P>Checkout Lane Surprise</i></b><P>A few months ago I was in line at the supermarket. My cart was piled high and I was anxious to be on my way. I was grateful that the young woman in front of me only had a partially filled cart. As I watched her carefully unload her groceries, I could see that she seemed anxious. As the checker finished ringing up the groceries, the young woman leaned across the check stand, whispered something to the checker, and left &#151; without her groceries. The checker piled the bags onto the cart and set it off to the side.<P>I guessed the scenario. The young woman didn't have enough money to pay for her purchase.<P>The clerk looked up at me and smiled, "Thanks for waiting. She had to go to the bank for more money."<P>I looked at the mountain of groceries in my cart, remembering my own scary days back in the early 1980s when I first decided I wanted to be a writer. My husband, Wayne, and I had four young children, and as a construction electrician, Wayne was often between jobs. I remembered well when we were feeding our young family of six on Wayne's unemployment check of $150 a week.<P>I felt that inner discomfort that I sometimes get when God nudges me to do something. I call these moments "divine appointments." It wasn't by accident that I turned up behind this young woman.<P>"How much were her groceries?" I asked.<P>The clerk looked up as if she hadn't understood my question.<P>"How much was the bill?" I repeated. She pulled the tape from the bag and told me. Then she shrugged her shoulders as if she didn't know why I'd be asking.<P>"Kindly add that amount to my bill," I told her.<P>The clerk stopped checking my groceries. I was glad my piled-high cart had kept others from lining up behind me.<P>"She may not even come back," the woman cautioned. "Sometimes if a person doesn't have enough money she says she'll come back because she's embarrassed. She probably won't return, so save your money."<P>"No," I insisted, "I want to pay for her groceries."<P>"She probably won't be back," she said in a flippant tone. "What do you want me to do with them then?"<P>"Give the food to someone in need," I suggested.<P>I could see the clerk had never had someone offer to pay for someone else's groceries. She appeared shocked and continued to stare at me. "Why are you doing this?" she asked.<P>I explained that at one time I'd been in that young woman's situation. I remembered wondering how I'd feed my family. I told her how grateful I was for all that God had given me. I tried to explain that with gratitude comes the urge to share.<P>She didn't say a word, and I was left wondering if I was babbling on far too long. What I was doing didn't make a lot of sense. The clerk was right &#151; the woman who'd left might very well not return. Yet I couldn't shake the feeling that God wanted me to do this. I've come to recognize those promptings from God and learned not to resist them.<P>Slowly the clerk returned to ringing up my groceries. "I want to know more about God," she said simply.<P>That's when it hit me. This nudge from God wasn't about the young woman who left her groceries behind. God hadn't nudged me for her sake, but for the clerk's sake! For whatever reason, she needed to witness an act of generosity done in the Lord's name.<P>I thought of Corrie ten Boom's fleas. In this case, my own gift of generosity was having a benefit I had never imagined, just as the fleas had a benefit Corrie had never imagined. I thought I was helping the young woman needing groceries, but the Lord had set His sights on the clerk. Something my Florida pastor, James E. Biles Sr., once said in a sermon came to mind. I remembered being so struck by his words that I wrote them down on the margin of my bulletin&#58; "We aren't only called to share the gospel. We are called to <i>show</i> the gospel."<P>Look at it this way&#58; had God not been tutoring me in the habit of gratitude, I might have been stewing about the delay caused by the young woman's inability to pay. Instead I was able to listen to that still, small voice that sometimes gently urges me to act. Had I rationalized that the young woman might never come back for her groceries, I might have missed blessing the person God intended. Although I frequently shopped at that store I never saw her again, and yet I feel God planted her in my path that day for His purposes.<P>Keep the eyes of your heart open for those God may want to help through you today.<P><i>Discovery<P>Practicing an attitude of gratitude spills over to acts of generosity.<br><b><P><i>The Science of Gratitude</i></i></b><P>My own discovery about the importance of gratitude was largely developed as I read the Bible. But did you know that science confirms the importance of gratitude as well?<P>Two researchers, R. A. Emmons of the University of California, Davis, and M. E. McCullough of the University of Miami, have been researching the dimensions and perspectives of gratitude. Their findings fascinate me and have been the basis of dozens of articles in scientific journals and bulletins. Take a look with me at what they learned.<P>Their experiments demonstrated that those who kept gratitude journals on a weekly basis exercised more regularly, reported fewer illness symptoms, felt better about their lives as a whole, and were more optimistic about the upcoming week compared to those who recorded troubles or neutral life events. As they continued to experiment, they found that participants who kept gratitude lists were more likely to have made progress over a two-month period toward their most important personal goals &#151; academic, interpersonal, and health based &#151; compared to the subjects in their control group. So gratitude not only contributed to better overall health but helped people reach important goals. Think about it. Our Creator designed us to benefit when we give thanks.<P>And that's not all. Here's something else the researchers discovered&#58; a daily gratitude exercise where young adults regularly focused on specific things for which they were thankful resulted in higher reported levels of the positive states of alertness, enthusiasm, determination, attentiveness, and energy.<P>Remember that I said that generosity grows out of gratitude? The study also showed that participants in the daily gratitude experiment were more likely to report having helped someone with a personal problem or having offered emotional support to another. You see, when gratitude becomes a habit, then generosity seems to follow naturally.<P>In a sample of adults with neuromuscular disease, a twenty-one-day gratitude intervention resulted in greater amounts of energy, positive moods, a greater sense of feeling connected to others, more optimistic ratings of one's life, and better sleep duration and quality relative to a control group.<P>Wow!<P>But there's more. Stephen Post, PhD, professor of bioethics at Case Western Reserve University's School of Medicine, is the author of <i>Why Good Things Happen to Good People</i>. In an article in <i>Guideposts</i>, "The Power of Gratitude," he shares five things he discovered about gratitude&#58;<blockquote><P><b>1.</b><i> Gratitude defends</i>. Just fifteen minutes a day focusing on the things you're grateful for will significantly increase your body's natural antibodies.<P><b>2.</b><i> Gratitude sharpens.</i> Naturally grateful people are more focused mentally and are measurably less vulnerable to clinical depression.<P><b>3.</b> <i>Gratitude calms.</i> A grateful state of mind induces a physiological state called resonance that's associated with healthier blood pressure and heart rate.<P><b>4.</b> <i>Gratitude strengthens.</i> Caring for others is draining. But grateful caregivers are healthier and more capable than less grateful ones.<P><b>5.</b> <i>Gratitude heals.</i> Recipients of donated organs who havethe most grateful attitudes heal faster.</blockquote><P><i>Discovery<P>Gratitude gives back. When we practice gratitude, not only do we grow in our trust of God, but we benefit physically, emotionally, and spiritually.<br><b><P><i>Gratitude as a Prerequisite to Giving</i></i></b><P>As we acknowledge all we have, as we learn to praise God for all He has done for us, God helps us pry our fingers off our possessions, our BlackBerrys, and our bank statements. This brings us full circle. Can you see why we explored gratitude before we set off on our journey to discover the power of generosity? Gratitude is the basis for giving. Grumpy, stingy people cannot live in the spirit of generosity. In order to be able to open our hands to give, we first have to give thanks for all we've been given. It's just that simple!<blockquote><b><P>Simple Acts of Gratitude</b><P>&#149; Begin a gratitude journal. Each day write five things for which you are grateful.<P>&#149; Practice praise. Nothing opens our eyes to the gifts we have been given more than focusing on the Giver. Find at least one new thing to praise God for each day.<P>&#149; Stay alert for those "God nudges" and be grateful when you sense them. When you feel like you should be doing something for someone, act on it. Keep track of those nudges. Write them down, noting how you responded and the outcome. When we practice listening for that still small voice we become better at hearing it.<P>&#149; Thank God in all circumstances. This means that sometimes you'll thank Him for the "fleas" in your life.</blockquote>One Simple Act &#169; 2009 Debbie Macomber
