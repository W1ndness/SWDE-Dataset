Three brothers who have conquered their demons, but they've never forgotten their long lost brother, Kev, whom they believed to be dead. When the McCloud brothers discover Kev is alive, they won't rest until they find him... <P>Beaten and tortured almost to death, Kev Larsen was found eighteen years earlier in a warehouse alley. He survived his brutal ordeal, but his memories before that night were completely erased. When he nearly dies from trying to save someone from drowning, the brain surgery he has to save his life triggers fragmented, terrifying memories. With only these memories and the name of his torturer to guide him, Kev is determined to unlock the secrets to his past. <P>Edie Parrish has always been good at not letting anyone get too close to her. If someone were to learn of her unusual gift, her life would be immediately jeopardized. But when Kev Larsen discovers who she really is, Edie has only one choice&#58; to trust him. And soon, Edie can't resist her consuming desire for him-even though she knows she'll have to pay a price for it. <P>Now Kev and Edie must race against time and place their faith in each other to stop a deadly legacy...<br><br><br>
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Kevin McCloud, believed dead for 18 years, resurfaces in fantastic fashion in McKenna's latest red-hot McCloud sizzler (Edge of Midnight; etc.). After recovering from an injury suffered while trying to prevent a drowning, Kev, now 40-ish, begins remembering what happened leading up to the traumatic events that left him an amnesiac and is lured back into the dark web cast by the evil scientists intent on completing the now-dead psycho scientist Christopher Osterman's devious mind-control invention. When Kev meets graphic novelist Edie Parrish at a book signing, they forge a connection that's deeper than romantic; as it turns out, Edie has psychic powers, a history with Osterman, and believes Kev may have inspired the hero of her graphic novel. McKenna's steamy style, sci-fi twists, and possible family reunion makes this the best McCloud update yet, but readers who aren't already well versed in the series will want to start with the earlier volumes.

The  roar of icy water filled his ears. The current would pull him loose in  counted seconds. Seconds measured by the pounding pulse of  blood through his brain. Each throb hurt like a raving motherlover,  but there was nothing like imminent death to take a guy's mind off a  headache.  <p>     His little angel's face flashed through his mind. His dream companion,  his spirit guide. Her big eyes looked sad, and scared.  He'd known since he got out of bed that today was going to be  the day. He'd had that prickle, as if someone were looking at the  back of his neck. Not surprising, since he'd set the day aside for high-adrenaline  sports activities, his chief joy in what passed for his life.  One would think, having gotten a clue from the Great Beyond that  death lurked nearby, that a reasonable, sane person would spend the  day on the couch, watching reruns. Cruising the mall bookstore,  reading about mindfulness or voluntary simplicity. Lying low in a  multiplex, watching a nature documentary. Sipping a green tea latte.  Well out of sight.  <p>     Not him. The reasonable, sane parts of himself were out in space.  Along with his memories and his normal and natural fear of death.  Danger? Bring it the fuck <i>on</i>. He should be dead already anyway.  Look at his face. Kids ran screaming to mommy when they saw his  bad side.  <p>     Cold had numbed the pain. He no longer felt his hand, clamped  around the boughs of the dead tree. He did not feel the compound  fracture in his other arm. His injured limb flopped in the water,  sucked by the current, a few yards from the head of the falls. His  broken bone tented out the nylon of his jacket, pinkish with blood.  But he doubted he'd be using that arm again, once the water flung  him over the brink.  <p>     Whatever. He'd been smash totaled years ago. Living on borrowed  time. Half a brain, half a life. No clue at all.  <p>     <i>Don't start with that. Just shut the fuck up.</i> He did crazy shit like  this for the express purpose of keeping himself too zapped with  adrenaline to indulge in self pity. That was why he hung off the edge  of cliffs, hang-glided treacherous air currents, rafted badass rapids.  When he was that close to death, he felt buzzing, connected. Almost  alive.  <p>     Since Tony found him he'd had some mechanism functioning that  damped his emotional volume way down. High enough for function,  but no more. Probably caused by the trauma to his brain that had  caused the amnesia, and rendered him speechless, back in the bad  old days.  <p>     Whatever it was, he was bored with it. If he could, he'd join the  military, fly fighter jets. Playing with toys like that, yeah. Talk about a  coping mechanism. But the military wouldn't want a guy with  crossed wires, a questionable identity and a black hole in his mind to  fly their hundred million dollar toys. They'd put him to work cleaning  engines. If they took him at all. No, he had to make do with high-risk  sports. They kicked his ass into high gear, and he liked that gear.  The color, the noise. The buzz of being awake to it, aware of it. Giving  a shit.  <p>     He'd gotten what he wanted. But he was going to pay big. He  stared at the top of the falls. Clouds of vapor rose from the thundering  tons of water crashing down, hundreds of feet below. How many  hundreds? He tried to remember. Several. Well over three. Whoo  hah.  <p>     Not that he was afraid of dying. At most, he was curious. Sorry  he'd never unravel the great questions of his existence, at least not as  a living man, and who knew what happened after? He'd never speculated.  His present mortal existence was problem enough, for as long  as he could remember. Roughly half of his life. He didn't know how  old he was. Tony put him around twenty when he'd saved Kev from  the warehouse thug eighteen years ago. So he was fortyish. Give or take.  <p>     At least the boy was going to make it. Kev was immobilized by  tons of rushing icewater, but out of the corner of his eye, he saw activity  in the trees choking the cliffside shore. Rescue proceedings  were underway. Other people besides Kev had been at the point  when he'd put ashore, where he'd seen the kids spin past, oarless  and out of control. Only a guy with a black hole in his brain would be  suicidal enough to jump in after them at that point in the rapids, but  he'd taken no time to ponder that implacable truth. He just went for it.  <p>     And then, a long, hopeless wrestle with nature while the water got  wilder, the roar of the falls louder.  <p>     While death approached, smiling. Happy to see him. His old pal.  <p>     Maybe he'd subconsciously wanted it. Bruno threw that death  wish crap in his face a lot, whenever he got cracked up doing daredevil  sports. Could be. Not worth worrying about, though. Particularly  now.  <p>     The kids had capsized by the time he caught up. Kev saw a bobbing  head and scooped one out of the water by sheer, blind luck.  Then they plunged into a trough, the raft flipped, and they were  tossed like twigs, the boy flailing, choking. He'd clamped the kid  against him, struggled, kicked. He'd wanted to save that kid. Wanted  it ferociously. He was played out, now, though. In fact, he felt strangely  serene.  <p>     The other boy was gone, over the falls. That was fucked, and he  was sorry. Rescue was on the way for the other one, but the greedy  way the water sucked at the tree told him the hard truth.  <p>     He was going down. Anytime.  <p>     He forced his head to turn, checked on the kid. Sixteen or so. A  drowned rat, clinging to the lucky side of the rock that split the top  of the falls into two long, thin tails, hence the name, Twin Tails Falls.  The weight of rushing water pinned him against the bulwark of the  rock. He couldn't move if he wanted to. But he'd live. That was good.  <p>     It wasn't strength or skill that had smacked them up against that  jutting rock. Just chance. And then, just as fast, <i>bam</i>. That bastard  came up so fast, he barely shoved the kid out of the way before the  tree trunk snapped his arm, smashed God only knew what else in his  thorax, knocked him loose-and then spun out perpendicular to the  falls, catching on a rock across the torrent. It formed a barrier, trapping  him against a temporary dam. But not for long.  <p>     Smashing him, then saving him. When it worked loose, it would  fuck him again, definitively. He'd ride that bastard out over the cliff.  <p>     The story of his life. Something inside him laughed, with stony  irony. Wasn't it always the way. Like Tony, who'd dragged Kev out of  his own rapids years ago, and kept him there, brain damaged, shambling  and speechless. Washing dishes, mopping floors for room and  board at the diner. Lying on a sagging cot, watching paint peel in the  windowless mildewed room behind the diner where he'd slept. For  fucking <i>years</i>.  <p>     The rope thrown out to save him. The same rope that he strangled  himself on. It was almost funny. Except that it wasn't.  <p>     The tree was about to go. The branches stuck on the rocks on the  other side were wavering, wild water bending the flexible limbs, teasing  them loose. The tree shuddered, rolled. The water sucked and  insisted.  <p>     Any time now. He composed himself, tried to pay attention, to be  present for it, to breathe. Difficult. So cold. So much water. The kid's  mouth gaped, begging Kev to do something. As if he could swim  against that current, even if he weren't fucked-up. He had as much  strength left as a broken doll. A final swell shook the tree loose. The  ponderous slow motion made those last moments of clinging stretch  out, infinitely long.  <p>     He struggled to stay conscious. The last wild ride. He'd better  enjoy it. He wondered if he'd know, once he was dead, who he'd  been before. What he'd done, who he'd known. Who he'd loved.  <p>     Probably not. This was all he got. It would just have to do.  <p>     <i>Whoosh</i>, the river rolled him under the tree and spat him far out  into vastness. Endless space, above, below. Turning, head over ass.  <p>     The angel flashed across his mind. Those big gray eyes, so  achingly sweet. A sharp sting of regret that he didn't understand.  And another face, too, scowling his disapproval as the immutable  laws of physics had their stern way with him. A face he saw in his  dreams every night. A young guy. His face maddeningly familiar.  <p>     Kev had been having a dream argument with that guy, that very  morning, he suddenly remembered. The man had been scolding him.  <p>     <i>"Dying is easy. You told me that yourself," the guy said. "It's living  that's hard. Meathead. Hypocrite. You piss me off."</i>  <p>     So that was how he'd known today would be dangerous.  <p>     Part of his mind hooted and shrieked with unreasoning joy at the  icy rush of air and water on his face. <i>Whoa. This shit is fun.</i> Another  part pondered acceleration rates of falling objects, wind shear, probable  force of impending impact on the rocks below. He calculated it  down to ten digits after the decimal in that last, eternal instant-        And hurtled into a blank, white nothing.  <p>  <p>     Goddamnit to hell. Thick, stupid, useless cow.  <p>     Ava Cheung refocused her mind to a laser point. So much information  streamed through the human nervous system to make a  body move smoothly through space. So much of it was automatic.  One couldn't fathom how much until one tried to provide the impulses  for someone else's body, using one's own will while simultaneously  suppressing theirs. Mandy was responding poorly. Shuffling,  clumsy. Ava could not get the girl to shut her mouth and keep it  closed. The drooling was driving her crazy, and it was all the more  grotesque with Mandy's sexpot beauty, her heavily lashed blue eyes  vacant behind the goggles, her pupils vastly dilated by the X-Cog  prep drugs.  <p>     Ava fancied that X-Cog master-crowning required a skill level comparable  to what it must take to play an instrument at a professional  level. It required intense concentration to make the crowned person  move and speak naturally. Unless you upped the doses, which lowered  the subject's resistance, but melted their brains in a scant hour.  Not cost efficient. One had to be a virtuoso, like her, and Dr. O, of  course.  <p>     This rendered the X-Cog interface less commercially feasible.  How many people were willing to put in the hours to hone a new  skill? People were lazy, contemptible slobs, as a rule. They needed  things to be easy.  <p>     Ava was committed to finding a way to make X-Cog accessible to  anyone with the money to pay for it, and Mandy was the umpteenth  effort to that end. But a virtuoso needed a decent instrument to play.  Not a thick, dull, unresponsive piece of <i>shit</i>.  <p>     Ava yanked off the master crown and flung it onto the table, more  forcefully than she should have, considering how much it cost to develop  and produce. The streamlined silver cap was very different from  Dr. O's heavy, clunky design, which had given her tension headaches.  Dr. O hadn't bothered with aesthetics. Dr. O had been a results man.  <p>     The new design was her own graceful innovation. Everything essential  was there, but the end result was a light-as-air tangle of flexible  wires and sensors on a light mesh cap. Both master and slave crowns  were designed to be easily concealed beneath a hat, scarf, or wig.  <p>     Ava's brilliance was wasted on Mandy. The dumb little bitch was  going straight into the shredder. Mandy whimpered as Ava wrenched  goggles and crown off the girl's head, yanking out long blond hair.  She whipped the master crown glasses off. Stupid, talentless cow.  Crowning her was like trying to send nervous impulses through a  lump of clay.  <p>     Ava smoothed glossy black hair back and stared at Mandy, who  swayed on her feet, gaping. The girl was dressed in the silver spandex  jog bra and shorts that Ava had mandated as a uniform for X-Cog  test subjects. She liked her girls to look sexy and sharp. But Mandy  looked anything but sharp, with drool trailing off her chin.  <p>     The look on the girl's face disgusted her. She slapped Mandy. The  girl stumbled against the table, looking vaguely confused.  <p>     Ava slapped her again, harder. And again. Smack. Smack. Blood  trickled from Mandy's nose, from her split lip. The girl's hands crept  up, tried to cover her face. Ava struck Mandy's ears, whapped the  back of her head, knocking her forward. Mandy thudded heavily to  her knees.  <p>     "Back off, Av. That's millions of dollars you're kicking around."  <p>     Ava spun around, and shot a poisonous look at the man who had  just walked in. "Mind your own fucking business, Des."  <p>     Desmond jerked his chin towards Mandy. "She is my business."  <p>     "She's a worthless piece of shit," Ava hissed.  <p>     "Don't take your frustration out on her." Desmond's arrogant,  know-it-all tone made her want to put out one of his bright blue  eyes. "You thought that upping the burn would give you more direct  control with the crown at a lower dose of the drug. You were wrong.  Too bad. Honest mistake. We won't make it again. Grow up, Ava.  Move on."  <p>     "But the basic idea is sound! Next time, I'll recalibrate the-"  <p>     "No." The curt word cut her off. "We reached the point of diminishing  returns weeks ago. No more cutting, no more burning."  <p>     There was no arguing with Des when he got that tone. He was the  one with the money, the contacts. He'd funded her whole show,  since Dr. O bit the dust. But bumping up against the limits of her  power over him made her bad tempered. She kicked Mandy's buttock  viciously. The girl lurched forward with a pathetic grunt. "Don't  lecture me," she said, sulkily. "I'm the one who's clubbing with the  stinking masses to troll for test subjects! Wasting time I should spend  on research, bumping and grinding with Ecstasy whores like her!"  She kicked Mandy again, making her whimper. "I need to delegate  this tedious shit!"  <p>     "I'm trying, babe, but I don't understand why you're so set on  wiping them. I enjoy crowning the ones who aren't burned or cut  much better. It's that inner resistance that makes it exciting, you know?"  <p>     Ava snorted. "It's not about excitement. You've never tried to  crown a subject into anything more complex than sucking on your  dick. Try making one of them type a string of code, and see how far you  get. You can compel a girl to blow you by putting a twenty dollar gun  to her head. You don't need a ten million dollar X-Cog crown. I want to  market X-Cog to defense contractors. Understand? Are you with me  here?"  <p>     "Fellatio is actually a pretty complex motor process." Des sounded  faintly hurt. "Particularly when you're hung."  <p>     Ava rolled her eyes. "Please. Leave the neuroscience to me."  <p>     Des waved that away. "I've got good news and bad news."  <p>     "I don't want to hear the bad news," she said pettishly.  <p>     "Then I'll tell you the good news, first." He nudged Mandy thoughtfully  with his toe. "We need a steady supply of high quality, hand-selected  lab rats. We also need someone to deal with our disposal  issue. Remember Tom Bixby, from the Haven?"  <p>     Ava grimaced. Bixby had been one of Dr. O's rich pets. One who'd  survived and thrived after Dr. O's Brain Potential Program. Off to  Harvard with Dessie. She still remembered his hot eyes, his groping  hands. "An arrogant prick, as I recall. That's your brilliant idea?"  <p>     "He runs his own private military company. Bixby Enterprises. It's  gotten huge. I think X-Cog would be extremely interesting to him.  And we would have multiple layers of security, since he's Club O."  <p>     Ava's lip curled. "But he's a dickhead."  <p>     Des's eyes rolled impatiently. "Don't be a spoiled baby. Offering  him a partnership would solve all our problems in one move."  <p>     "And create a lot more," she said.  <p>     Des's eyes narrowed. "I've set up a demo. You will be good, Ava."  <p>     Well, look at him. Throwing his weight around. Trying to whip her  into line with his big dick. She crossed her arms over her chest. "Tell  me the bad news," she said. "Maybe it'll cheer me up."  <p>     Des stared at her, nostrils distended, cheeks reddening. Anger  turned him on. A fact she often turned to her advantage. "I was at a  Parrish Foundation board meeting today," he said finally. "Parrish is  taking over where his bitch of a wife left off. Getting rid of Linda distracted  him for a while, but the party's over, everybody out of the pool.  He's engaged a panel of financial forensics experts to examine every  penny of Parrish Foundation money spent in the past three years.  And to vet all future projects. No more cutting it close."  <p>     "Oh, God," Ava moaned. "I'm so close to a breakthrough!"  <p>     "I know, but what can you do. He's as much of a pit bull as his ball-busting  wife, may she burn in hell. The Morality Police don't want  anything naughty going down, after Dr. O's big scandal."  <p>     "Fucking hypocrites. 'Helix was a victim, too,'" Ava mimicked.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Fade to Midnight</b> by <b>SHANNON MCKENNA</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Shannon McKenna.
