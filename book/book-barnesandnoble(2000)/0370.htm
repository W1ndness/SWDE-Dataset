But the terrified victim, a conservator of rare books and maps, refuses to cooperate with investigators. Then another woman is found murdered in that same apartment with an extremely valuable book, believed to have been stolen. As Alex pursues the murderer, she is drawn into the strange and privileged world of the Hunt family, major benefactors of the New York Public Library and passionate rare book collectors.<br><br>Eventually Alex connects their internal family rivalries to a priceless edition of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, which also contains the world�s oldest map. Would one of the well-bred Hunts be willing to kill for the treasures?...</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Kevin Allman</h3><p>What makes <i>Lethal Legacy</i> one of Linda Fairstein's stronger offerings is the intriguing setting: the catacombs beneath the New York Public Library. It also helps that the author downplays the unrealistic girlie-girl aspects of Cooper's life&#8230;in favor of a heightened focus on the mystery and its mix of high society, rare maps, library crimes and literary restoration. Fairstein presents the latter, interestingly and in great detail, as just another form of forensic science.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>Hailed by Patricia Cornwell as "one of the most promising forces in crime fiction," former head of the Manhattan District Attorney's Sex Crimes Unit Linda Fairstein has hooked readers with her intense mystery series featuring assistant D.A. -- and Fairstein's alter ego -- Alex Cooper.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><h3>Customer Reviews</h3><ul class="reviewBox"><li class="first">Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget " id="9781615559176_BK"><span class="avg-4 section_updateRating"></span></span></li><li>Ratings: 33<span id="numReviews">Reviews: 22</span></li><li><a name="seeAllReviewsContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-All-Reviews">See All Reviews</a></li><li><p class="writeReview"><strong><a name="writeReview_OverviewTab" class="section_writeReview" rel="nofollow" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-Write-A-Review" href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/WriteReview.aspx?EAN=9781615559176"></a></strong></p></li></ul><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Lethal Legacy<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=GeorgeEllington">GeorgeEllington</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1316945_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781615559176_BK_1_1316945" href="#previewReview_1316945" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>February 21, 2010: 
											Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cooper is called away from an eight-year-old case to help respond to what may have been a sexual assault. The victim was Tina Barr, a former conservator for the New York Public Library. Barr proves very reluctant to cooperate with Cooper in any way, but her subsequent disappearance and the discovery of a dead body in Barr's apartment direct Cooper's investigation squarely at the grand library itself. <p/><p/>Lethal Legacy is very well written, fast-paced, and of particular interest to bibliophiles. This is a tale concerned not only with a world of crime, but even more so with the deep ambitions and compelling greed of wealthy families involved in the world of antique books and maps.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Good Fairstein<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=MayaMA">MayaMA</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1245721_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781615559176_BK_1_1245721" href="#previewReview_1245721" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>November 13, 2009:

She went on to receive a law degree from the prestigious University of Virginia School of Law in 1972. In November of that year, Fairstein was assigned to the staff of the New York County District Attorney's office and was soon heading up the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit, where she developed a reputation as one of the toughest prosecutors in the office's history. Fairstein spent  the next two decades dedicating herself to nailing the worst of the city's sexual offenders, working on such high-profile cases as the Preppy Murder and the Central Park Jogger. <p>    In 1993, Fairstein was named "Woman of the Year" by <I>New Woman</I> and <I>Glamour</I> magazines. A year later, her groundbreaking nonfiction book, <I>Sexual Violence: Our War Against Rape,</I> was named a Notable Book by <I>The New York Times</I>. <p>    Fairstein's first foray into fiction writing was 1994's <I>Final Jeopardy,</I> which introduced the tough, savvy assistant D.A. Alexandra "Alex" Cooper -- a character close to the author's own identity -- who was well received by fans and critics. As <I>Publishers Weekly</I> noted, Alex's "greatest appeal lies in the warmth of her friendships, the humanness of her mistakes and her unswerving devotion to protecting the next female from harm." <p>    Since then, Fairstein has continued to chronicle Alex Cooper's crime-solving adventures in a string of bestsellers that draws on the author's thoroughgoing knowledge of the legal system and longtime affection for the Big Apple. A believer in public service, Fairstein sits on the board of directors of several nonprofit groups, among them the National Center for Victims of Crime, Phoenix House Foundation, and New York Women's Agenda, and has also served on President Clinton's Violence Against Women Advisory Council, New York Women's Agenda Domestic Violence Committee, the American College of Trial Lawyers, The Women's Forum, Mystery Writers of America, and Sisters in Crime. <p>    In an interview on her publisher's web site, Fairstein explains that her career and her life's mission are one in the same: "I think so much more is possible in terms of what we are able to give women who have been victims of violence and how they can triumph in a courtroom," Fairstein reflects. "So to take this -- the professional life I've had over the last 30 years and to mix it with the great pleasure of writing -- is something I never dreamed I'd actually be able to accomplish."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Fairstein is married</b> to Justin Feldman, a lawyer who helped run Robert F. Kennedy's 1964 United States Senate campaign.<p>    <b>Fairstein has admitted to</b> having her eye on the post of United States Attorney General, and in fact interviewed for that position in 1993. <p>    <b><I>Cold Hit</I> made</b> President Clinton's highly-publicized vacation reading list in 1999. <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the winter of 2005, Linda Fairstein took some time to talk with us about some of her favorite books, authors, and interests. </I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  When I was thirteen years old, I read Margaret Mitchell's <I>Gone with the Wind</I>, and that fascinating saga of Scarlett O'Hara against the background of the Civil War kept me spellbound because of the storytelling. I loved the rich texture of the plot, the vivid scenes depicted, and the fact that it was so long and dense in its unraveling. I had written short stories long before that, but it was reading that novel -- the only one ever written by Mitchell -- which made me think I would love to try to tell stories that would engage a reader in the way Mitchell caught my imagination. <p>    <b>What are your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li>One of my favorite novels is John LeCarre's <I>The Spy Who Came In From the Cold</I>. I think it is a brilliantly plotted, taut spy thriller, which I first read when we were in the middle of the Cold War and had very different political enemies. LeCarre's characterizations were wonderful, and his themes of personal trust and betrayal played out against world politics were haunting. <p>    <li>Daphne DuMaurier's <I>Rebecca</I> is one of my favorite mysteries. What an incredible conceit -- to tell the entire story without ever giving us the protagonist's name. And the twists and turns were so carefully laid in that I never saw them coming. It's a very classy classic. <p>    <li>Tolstoy's <I>Anna Karenina</I> is such a powerful story. I love the intense emotion of it -- again the themes of personal betrayal -- and when I first read it as a high school student I was so thoroughly absorbed by the foreign atmosphere and mores that it helped shape my vision of European and Russian cultures. <p>    <li>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <I>Sherlock Holmes</I> stories were an early and strong influence.  I delighted in the wisdom of Holmes, and his ability to use his skills to deduce clues and solve crimes. I go back to his stories often and they never fail to delight me. <p>    <li>Edgar Allan Poe's <I>Tales of the Bizarre and Arabesque</I> was another tremendous influence in my development as a devotee of the crime fiction that I would one day start to write. I remember the nightmares I had after reading stories like "The Pit and the Pendulum" and "The Telltale Heart," and marveled at the creative genius of this dark storyteller. <p>    <li>Harper Lee's <I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I> is a modern masterpiece -- and oddly again -- the only novel written by this writer. Not only is the prose elegant, but the lessons about the human conscience and the power of the search for justice have always appealed to my combined interests in law and literature. <p>    <li><I>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</I> is probably Rebecca West's most distinguished non-fiction work. In her description of her travels through Eastern Europe in the 1930's, there are stunning observations about history and the people of the region that foreshadow the horrors of the coming world war. <p>    <li>When I'm not reading crime fiction, I love to read historical biography. It fascinates me to learn about the lives of great leaders -- family backgrounds, triumphs and tragedies that shaped their visions, personal choices made along the way. Two of my favorites are Joseph Lash's <I>Franklin and Eleanor</I> and William Manchester's wonderful series about Winston Churchill called <I>The Last Lion</I>.<p>    <li>Poetry has always been a great joy for me to read, and has been since earliest childhood, when I demanded some verses by Robert Louis Stevenson before going to sleep. So I'd always add a volume -- from Shakespeare's sonnets to my college-age obsession with Edna St. Vincent Millay's works to Philip Larkin -- and  throw in just about any of the classics from Blake to Keats.<p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  My most favorite film is Hitchcock's <I>Notorious</I>, starring Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant. First of all, it's Hitchcock -- so the story is a wonderfully devious mix of foreign intrigue and mystery. The actors are fantastic, the story is taut and riveting, down to the very last scene, and it's got a wonderful romance in the middle of all spy-jinks. <p>    <I>Rebecca</I> is one of the few novels to which I've ever been attached that was made, in my opinion, into a fabulous movie. I love a lot of murder mysteries from the �40s and �50s --their atmosphere, their <I>noir</I> quality, the style of the acting -- so <I>Dial "M" for Murder</I>, <I>The Maltese Falcon</I>, <I>Double Indemnity</I> -- classics that hold up time after time. <p>    I adore good comedy -- just about anything Woody Allen has done, and especially movies like <I>Manhattan</I> and <I>Annie Hall</I>, which are both brilliant.<p>    I could watch <I>Gone With the Wind</I> every few months and still need a box of tissues by my side, and swoon again over Clark Gable. <p>    Give me a classic movie channel and a bowl of popcorn -- if I can't be reading a good book -- and I'm happy for days on end. <p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I guess I give away my age -- and my college days in the 1960s -- to say that my favorite kind of music -- in the house, in my car, on the new iPod -- is Motown. I love the great girl groups and the Temptations, and would go anywhere to see and hear Bette Midler, but my all time favorite is Smokey Robinson. Next come the Stones and the Beatles, and maybe a few of the great songs of The Band. For calmer times, I listen to a lot of James Taylor and Carly Simon -- both also staples of Martha's Vineyard, so it's a wonderful connection through the music. I also like Dr. John a lot.<p>    When I'm writing, I can't listen to anything at all that has lyrics -- it's a total distraction and I find myself singing along in the background (not a voice any of you would want to hear). So one of my other long-time passions is ballet, which I studied for several decades and attend frequently. I have CDs of the scores of all my favorite ballets, and find the music both soothing and inspirational when I sit down to write. <p>      <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  Books are always are my list of gifts to give to loved ones, and to receive. In giving, I try to match the interests of my friends or family to new books. I just sent my stepdaughter the new biography of Margot Fonteyn, because we both share a passion for the ballet. One of the really perks of being a writer is that I spend an inordinate amount of time in bookstores -- on line and real time -- and in libraries, so I try to stay on top of everything new and upcoming. It's great fun to introduce friends to crime writers they may not have read -- Harlan Coben or Michael Connelly, Denise Hamilton and Laura Lippman -- it's an interesting and exciting community of authors. <p>    There are very few ways to go wrong with giving me a book as a gift. I love mystery and crime (although you'll have a hard time finding something I haven't already bought myself, pre-ordering on B&N when I know the publication date is near), classics  (I majored in English literature in college and hope to read all of Trollope someday), or any interesting biography or historical nonfiction. Books make the best gifts in the world. <p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I like to start my writing in the morning, with my second cup of coffee, and write for as many hours a day as I can. My favorite place to write is on Martha's Vineyard, where I have a wonderful little cottage away from the house that's like my sanctuary. All my reference works and research, just my writing music, a wonderful view of water and wildflowers -- and always something related to the book I'm writing on my desk. When I wrote <I>Entombed</I>, my inspiration was a several-hundred year old brick taken from the actual house in which Edgar Allan Poe lived in lower Manhattan when the place was demolished a few years back. <p>      <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I took an unusual path to get to the place I am today. Writing was my first love, from adolescence on. I also had an interest in public service, and decided on a career in the law, putting off my dream to write fiction. Quite accidentally, my career as a young prosecutor took some dramatic directions when my field of specialty -- sexual assault and domestic violence -- became much more "high profile" than they were when I began my career in the law.<p>    What was unusual about my first book -- the nonfiction <I>Sexual Violence</I> -- is that the publishers came to me and asked me to write it. So I never had to deal with rejection slips or the difficulty of being published. Because that book was well-received and reviewed, I had the courage to set about trying what I had always wanted to do, which was write crime novels. So my advice is both to write what you know -- an old adage but one which carries a lot of weight -- and the other is never to give up your dreams. It may take years, but it's quite wonderful when you can make them come true.<p>      <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Write. Don't ever stop writing. You've got to do it every day, and if you don't like the process of writing, don't hope to be discovered. And read. It's so important to be "in" books all the time -- seeing how other writers use words and ideas. There's nothing better for developing your craft than writing and reading.<p>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>      <I>In the summer of 2004, we asked authors featured in Meet the Writers to give us a list of their all-time favorite summer reads, and tell us what makes them just right for the season. Here's what Linda Fairstein had to say: </I><P>    <li><I>Gone with the Wind</I> by Margaret Mitchell -- One of my earliest recollections of a great summer read was the first time I picked up <I>Gone with the Wind</i>, when I was about fifteen years old. I love thick, rich sagas for summer reading because it's about the only point in the year many of us get a big chunk of time in which to read, and I like grand storytelling with compelling characters who come alive.  <p>    Here was the chance to get lost in a great story -- everything from the historical background of the Civil War and Reconstruction, to the race and class structures of the old South, to the turbulent relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. This is the kind of book that made me long to be a writer -- a complete spellbinder with something for everyone, and classic old-fashioned storytelling.   <p>  <li><I>Marjorie Morningstar</I> by Herman Wouk -- I think I was sixteen when I spent a hot summer with this book. Has there ever been a teenage girl who hasn't responded to Wouk's heartbreaking story -- really a period piece that is so evocative of America in the 40's and 50's  - about a first love and dreams of career on the stage? It's become a classic and very 'campy' to reread as an adult -- this time it made me smile and laugh, thinking back on how it once made me practicallly weep for Marjorie's personal and professional predicament.<p>    <li><I>War and Peace</I> by Leo Tolstoy -- By college, where I majored in literature, I loved to spend part of the summer with one of the literary classics -- something in which I could bury myself for long days at the beach, without the responsibility of homework or term papers to interrupt. <I>War and Peace</I> is such a brilliant literary masterpiece. If you're ever going to attempt it, try it as a summer vacation read -- it will entertain, educate and enrich you -- and you'll impress everyone around you with your intellectual fortitude.<p>     <li><I>Plum Island</i> by Nelson DeMille -- Nobody writes thrillers like DeMille, and since I love my books to be dense and richly plotted, he's a winner every time. I can't say too much about the plot because I don't want to give it away, but everything from the setting to the danger and intrigue made this a summer favorite for me. And DeMille has done that time after time, so if it's not this tale, pack one of his others when you head to the beach. <p>     <li><I>Social Crimes</i> by Jane Stanton Hitchcock -- One of the smartest, wittiest authors I know managed to turn her insider's knowledge of New York society's inner circle into a devilish tale of betrayal and revenge and murder. The book is great fun and the dialogue is dead-on. Set in Manhattan and Southampton, it's perfect around the pool, and wickedly plotted to keep you guessing until the very end. This Hitchcock is much sexier than the moviemaker.<p>     <li><I>Rebecca</I> by Daphne DuMaurier -- I can remember the first time I read this book, visiting at a friend's house at the ocean on a stormy summer weekend in my 20's. I still consider it one of the most brilliant novels of suspense I've ever read -- the haunting setting, the terrified young bride (and the ingenious device of DuMaurier's, never to name her), and the mysterious Maxin de Winter. I'm pretty sure I devoured it in one late-night sitting, and couldn't get to sleep after that, nor did I go anywhere near the water the next day. Then get the DVD -- this is one of the few books I've ever loved that was perfectly recreated for the screen.<p>    <li><I>Play it as it Lays</i> by Joan Didion. Back in a serious mode, and ready for summertime literary fiction, there is no writer I enjoy more than Joan Didion. She's a riveting storyteller, and her prose is spare, smart and stunning. I still have my original hardcover copy of this -- sand in the binding -- and I've reread it many times, getting more out of it each time I do. She is a great chronicler of current affairs in her nonfiction, and one of the finest novelists alive. This book helps prove it.<p>     <li><I>The Eustace Diamonds</I> by Anthony Trollope -- I'm determined to work my way through Trollope. So almost every summer for the past fifteen years, I pick one of these 19th century novels from his vast body of work and transport myself to the mid-Victorian English countryside.  This is my favorite -- so far -- with it's delicious theft of the family jewels and the wonderful social commentary that disguishes itself within the tale of love and betrayal.<p>     <li><I>Spy Who Came in From the Cold</i> by John le Carr� -- I read this book the year it was published, 1964, on my summer vacation between high school and college. Since then, I've probably re-read it a dozen times. I think it's the best suspense novel of the second half of the 20th century -- it's so meticulously crafted that there is not a useless word in the entire book. The characterizations are perfectly drawn, the atmosphere captures the essence of the Cold War world in which we were living then, and the story is enviably well-plotted. Start here and stick with le Carr� and the rest of Smiley's people -- it will put a chill in your long, hot summer. <p>     Now, I have to admit that if I were packing my bags for a week in the guesthouse at a friend's summer beach cottage, the luggage would be weighed down by the latest crime novels. I love classics and historical biography and literary fiction, but nothing helps me escape like a fast-paced, intricately plotted thriller or procedural. So this summer, between laps in the pool, give me the latest by Harlan Coben, Robert Crais, Lisa Scottoline, Richard North Patterson, P. D. James, Patricia Cornwell... they just can't write them fast enough for me. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>When Assistant District Attorney Alex Cooper is summoned to Tina Barr&rsquo;s apartment on Manhattan&rsquo;s Upper East Side, she finds a neighbor convinced that the young woman was assaulted.

								Kevin Allman</h3><p>What makes <i>Lethal Legacy</i> one of Linda Fairstein's stronger offerings is the intriguing setting: the catacombs beneath the New York Public Library. It also helps that the author downplays the unrealistic girlie-girl aspects of Cooper's life&#8230;in favor of a heightened focus on the mystery and its mix of high society, rare maps, library crimes and literary restoration.

After Tina disappears, a woman's corpse turns up in Tina's abandoned apartment that looks like Tina's landlady, heiress Minerva Hunt, but in fact is Minerva's Romanian housekeeper. Alex and her sidekick, NYPD detective Mike Chapman, later learn that Tina was once employed by Minerva's father, Jasper Hunt, a rare book and map collector. The investigation leads Alex and her team into the dark depths of the New York Public Library in search of stolen items that certain bibliophiles and antique map enthusiasts would kill for. Full of fun information about the NYPL, the plot builds to a cool resolution that sets up Alex's next adventure involving a disturbing cold case. <I>Author tour.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>Could the pursuit of a rare book or map be motivation to lie, steal, or commit murder? Assistant DA Alexandra Cooper and colleagues Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace are drawn to the scene of a home invasion and possible assault of a young library conservator named Tina Barr. Barr is refusing to leave the confines of her Manhattan apartment, and fear prevents her from divulging details to help snare her assailant. The disappearance of Barr and two subsequent murders propel Cooper and cohorts into a world of socialites, rare map and book collectors, librarians, and thieves. Their investigation leads them to the New York Public Library, where they discover the magnificence and secrets that lie within this historic landmark. As they travel through hidden passages, marvel at rare antiquities, and uncover decades-old secrets, their adventures are reminiscent of the quests of Indiana Jones or <i>National Treasure</i>. Bibliophiles and Fairstein fans are in for a treat with this compelling 11th Alex Cooper novel (after <i>Killer Heat</i>). Recommended for all public libraries.

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P><b>ONE</b><br><br><br>&quot;I want you to open the door for me.&quot;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br><br>Only silence.<br><br>&quot;Look through the peephole,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm not a cop. I'm an assistant district attorney.&quot;<br><br>I stepped back and squared off so the woman inside the basement apartment could check me out. The hallway and staircase had been cleared of men in uniform, including the detail from Emergency Services poised to knock down her door with a battering ram, who were there when I arrived at the scene a short while ago at one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>I didn't hear any sound from within. No sense of her movement.<br><br>&quot;My name is Alexandra Cooper. You're Tina, aren't you? Tina Barr.&quot; I didn't say what my specialty was, that I was in charge of the DA's Office Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit. The police weren't certain she had been assaulted by the man who had earlier invaded her home, but several of them thought she might reveal those details to me if I could gain her confidence.<br><br>I moved in against the metal-clad door and pressed my ear to it, but heard nothing.<br><br>&quot;Don't lose your touch now, Coop.&quot; Mike Chapman walked down the steps and handed a light bulb to the rookie who was holding a flashlight over my shoulder. &quot;The money on the street's against you, but I'm counting on your golden tongue to talk the lady out so those guys can go home and catch some sleep.&quot;<br><br>The young cop passed the bulb to Mercer Wallace, the six-foot-six-inch-tall detective from the Special Victims Unit who had called me to the brownstone on the quiet block between Lexington and Third Avenues in the East 90's. <br><br>Mercer reachedoverhead and screwed it in, illuminating the drab, cracked paint on the ceiling and walls of the hallway. &quot;Somebody&#151;most likely the perp&#151;shattered the other one. There are slivers of glass everywhere.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks, kid,&quot; Mike said, dismissing the rookie. &quot;No progress here, Detective Wallace?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We haven't got a homicide,&quot; I whispered to Mercer. &quot;And they sell light bulbs at the bodega on Lex. I don't know why you think we needed Mike, but please get him off my back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Damn, I've listened to Blondie charm full-on perverts into boarding the bus for a twenty-five-to-life time share at Sing-Sing. I've seen her coax confessions from the lying lips of the deranged and demented. I've watched as weak-willed men&#151;&quot;<br><br>Mercer put his finger to his lips and pointed at the staircase.<br><br>&quot;Tina, these two detectives are my friends. I've worked with them for more than ten years.&quot; I paused to cough and clear my throat. There was still a bit of smoke wafting through the hallway. &quot;Can you tell me why you don't want to open up? Why it is you won't trust us? We're worried about your safety, Tina. About your physical condition.&quot;<br><br>Mercer pulled at my elbow. &quot;Let's go up for a break. Get some fresh air.&quot;<br><br>I stayed at the door for another few minutes and then followed Mike and Mercer to the small vestibule of the building and out onto the stoop. It was a mild October night, and neighbors returning to their homes, walking dogs, or hanging around the 'hood were checking on the police activity and trying to figure out what was wrong.<br><br>The uniformed sergeant from the 23rd Precinct whose team had been the first responders was on the sidewalk in front of the building, talking to Billy Schultz, the man who had called 911 an hour earlier.<br><br>&quot;What's the situation behind the house?&quot; Mike asked Mercer, as I caught up with them, on their way down the front steps.<br><br>&quot;Two cops stationed there. Small common garden for the tenants. Back doors from both the first floor and Barr's basement apartment, but no one has moved since they've been on site.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you know about the girl?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not much. Nobody seems to,&quot; Mercer said. He turned to the man standing with the sergeant, whom I guessed to be about forty, several years older than Mike and I. &quot;This is Mike Chapman, Billy. He's assigned to Night Watch.&quot;<br><br>Mike worked in Manhattan North Homicide, which helped staff the Night Watch unit, an elite squad of detectives on call between midnight and eight a.m., when precinct squads were most understaffed, to respond all over Manhattan to murders and situations like this one that the department referred to&#151;with gross understatement&#151;as &quot;unusuals.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Billy lives on the first floor,&quot; Mercer said. &quot;He's the guy who called 911.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good to meet you,&quot; Mike said. He turned to me. &quot;What's her name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tina Barr.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She your friend?&quot; he said to Billy.<br><br>&quot;We chat at the mailboxes occasionally. She's a quiet girl. Keeps to herself. Spent a lot of time gardening on weekends in the summer, so I ran into her out back every now and then, but I haven't seen her much since.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lived here long?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Me? Eighteen years?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tina sublets. A year, maybe more.&quot;<br><br>Mike ran his fingers through his thick black hair, looking from Billy to me. &quot;You sure she's in there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I could hear a woman crying when I first got here,&quot; I said. Whimpering was a more accurate word.<br><br>&quot;Tina was sobbing when I knocked on her door,&quot; Billy said.<br><br>&quot;But she wouldn't open up for you?&quot;<br><br>Billy Schultz adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose while Mike scrutinized him. &quot;No, sir.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why were you knocking? What made you call 911?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mercer gave us all this, Mike. Let me get back inside.&quot;<br><br>He held his arm out at me, palm perpendicular like a stop sign. &quot;Don't you want the chronology from the horse's mouth? Primary source. Catch me up, Billy.&quot;<br><br>I had one hand on the wrought-iron railing but stopped to listen.<br><br>&quot;I'm a graphic designer, detective. Worked late, stopped off for a burger and a couple of beers on my way home,&quot; Billy said. He was dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt. There were smudges of ink or paint on his jeans, too dark in color to be blood, I thought. &quot;It was about 12&#58;30 when I got near the building. That's when I saw this guy come tearing out the front door, down the steps.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What guy? Someone you know?&quot;<br><br>Billy Schultz shook his head. &quot;Nope. The fireman.&quot;<br><br>Mike looked to Mercer. &quot;Nobody told me about that. The fire department got here first?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not for real,&quot; Mercer said.<br><br>&quot;I mean I assumed he was a fireman. He was dressed in all the gear&#151;coat, boots, hat&#151;even had a protective mask of some kind on. That's why I couldn't see his face.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did you stop him? Did he talk to you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He flew by me, like there was a forest fire on Lexington Avenue he had to get to. Almost took me out. Even that didn't seem odd until I looked up the street for his truck, but there wasn't one around. Just weird.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What did you do then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I unlocked the door to the vestibule, and as soon as I got inside, I could smell smoke. I could see little waves of it sort of spiraling upward from the basement,&quot; Billy said. &quot;We don't have a super who lives in the building, so there was no one for me to call. I figured whatever happened had been resolved. By the guy I thought was a fireman. But I wanted to check it out, make sure there was nothing still burning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sarge, you want to get me that mask?&quot; Mercer said.<br><br>The older man walked to the nearest squad car and reached in for a paper bag while Billy Schultz talked.<br><br>&quot;I went downstairs first. It was pretty dark, but I could make out a small pile of rubble in the corner of the hallway, a couple of feet from Tina's door. Nothing was burning&#151;no flames&#151;but it was still smoldering. Kicking off a lot of smoke. That's when I knocked on her door.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did she answer?&quot; Mike asked.<br><br>&quot;No. Not then. I didn't hear anything. I figured maybe she wasn't home. I ran up to my apartment, filled a pitcher with water and came back down to douse whatever was still smoking. Figured the other firemen must have gone off to a bigger job and that the last one&#151;the guy who almost plowed me down&#151;was trying to catch up with them.&quot;<br><br>The sergeant passed the bag to Mercer, who put on a pair of latex gloves from his pocket before opening it.<br><br>&quot;It's when I went downstairs the second time that I heard Tina.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What did you hear, exactly?&quot; I asked.<br><br>Billy cocked his head and answered. &quot;I knocked again, just because I was worried that the firemen might have left her there even though there was still something smoldering in the hallway. She was weeping loudly, then pausing, like to inhale.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Words,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Did she speak any words?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, but I did. I told Tina it was me, asked her if she was alright. I was coughing myself from the smoke. I told her she could come up to my apartment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did she answer you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. She just cried.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How do you know it's Tina Barr you were talking to?&quot; Mike asked.<br><br>Billy hesitated. &quot;Well, at that point&#151;I, uh&#151;I just assumed it, detective. She lives there alone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What next?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I went home to get a bucket and broom. Swept some of the trash into the bucket to throw out on the street&#151;&quot;<br><br>Mike glanced at the sergeant. &quot;Yeah, we got it, Chapman. Looks like amateur smoke bombs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The sobbing was so bad by then I called 911, from my cell. Maybe she was sick, overcome by the smoke. I waited out here on the stoop till the officers came. Three minutes. Not much longer. That's when Tina went berserk. That's when I knew it was her, for sure. I recognized her voice, when she was yelling at the cops.&quot;<br><br>Mercer removed a large black object from the bag and dangled it in front of us.<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Billy said. &quot;That's what the fireman had on his face.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Found it halfway up the block,&quot; the sergeant said. &quot;Right in the perp's flight path.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That's not department gear,&quot; Mike said. &quot;It's a gas mask. Military style.&quot;<br><br>It was a black rubber helmet, with two holes for the eyes, and a broad snout-like respirator that would fit over the mouth, with a long hose attached.<br><br>&quot;Couldn't see a damn thing,&quot; Billy said. &quot;It covered his entire face.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What did the cops do?&quot; Mike asked.<br><br>&quot;I led them down to the basement. They knocked on Tina's door and one of them identified himself, said they were police. That's when she started yelling at them to leave her alone. I mean screaming at them. Freaked out. Sounded like she collapsed&#151;maybe fell onto the floor&#151;crying the whole time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What makes you think she's alone in there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We're guessing,&quot; Mercer said. &quot;She's the only one to make a sound&#151;no scuffling, no struggling, no other voices. But that's another reason ESU won't leave.&quot;<br><br>Mike started up the front steps toward me and prodded my side with his fingers. I went back in the vestibule toward the basement staircase.<br><br>&quot;One of the cops told Tina he just wanted to make sure that the fire hadn't affected her,&quot; Billy said, drawing a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his smoke-fogged glasses. &quot;Asked her if she could stand up and look through the peephole at his badge, for identification. She went wild.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mike asked.<br><br>&quot;Tina screamed at the cop. Told him that's how the guy got in. The fireman. That he showed her his badge and she opened the door.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was the fireman who was inside her apartment? You knew, Coop?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That's why Mercer called me. We don't know who the man was, why he was using such an elaborate disguise, why he went inside, and what he did to this woman. Okay? Don't come any closer, Mike. Let me talk to her.&quot;<br><br>I walked the short corridor to the rear of the hallway, glass crunching under the soles of my shoes.<br><br>&quot;Tina? It's Alex Cooper. We're all still here. The police officers won't leave until I convince them that you're unharmed. I'll keep them outside the building if you'll let me in for just a few minutes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'd rank that a toss up,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Ten minutes with you or the quick punch of a battering ram? Tough call.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You think this helps? You think she can't hear you?&quot; I threw up my arms in frustration as I turned to Mike. &quot;Mercer, please take him upstairs.&quot; <br><br>The men marched back to the first floor as I made another attempt to convince Tina Barr to let me in.<br><br>&quot;I'm the only one in the basement now, Tina. The men are all outside. I don't want them to break down your door any more than you do. But they're worried that you've been injured. There was a lot of smoke down here. Can you just tell me if you're hurt?&quot;<br><br>There was no answer for more than a minute. Then a soft voice spoke a word or two, that sounded as though the woman was still sitting or lying on the floor inside. I couldn't understand her, so I crouched beside the door and put my ear against it.<br><br>&quot;Sorry. What did you say?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not hurt. I'll be okay.&quot;<br><br>She spoke haltingly, her words caught in her throat.<br><br>&quot;Tina, are you having trouble breathing?&quot;<br><br>No answer.<br><br>&quot;We can give you oxygen, Tina. Is it the smoke? Is there still smoke in your apartment?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The man who was dressed like a fireman, did you let him come into your apartment?&quot;<br><br>She was crying again as she tried to speak. &quot;No, no I didn't let him in.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you told the police officer that&#151;&quot;<br><br>&quot;I only opened the door because he showed me a gold badge and told me there was a fire. I could smell the smoke and then saw it. I believed him.&quot; Tina Barr's words came out phrase by phrase, embedded in sobs. &quot;He forced his way inside. I didn't let him in.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You can trust us, Tina. Now you know that man wasn't actually a fireman. His badge wasn't real.&quot; Mercer had already checked that with the department, and had been telling that to Barr before I got there. &quot;The cops think the man started the fire himself in order to break in to your apartment.&quot;<br><br>She was taking deep breaths on the other side of the door.<br><br>I took one, too, and tried to get at what had so far been unspoken. &quot;I work with victims of sex crimes, Tina. That's all I do. It's why the police thought I might be able to help. I deal with the most sensitive cases you can imagine,&quot; I said, closing my eyes, which burned from the lingering smoke. &quot;Did this man assault you tonight?&quot;<br><br>She coughed again.<br><br>I didn't know how long he'd been within the apartment before Billy Schultz saw him running from the building at 12&#58;30 in the morning.<br><br>&quot;Did he awaken you when he knocked, Tina?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do you know what time it was when you first went to the door?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Five,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;Five o'clock in the afternoon?&quot; She must have been confused. &quot;Look, I'm going to have to let the police work on your door, or the back window in your kitchen, Tina. You may be a little woozy. He couldn't have been inside there that long.&quot;<br><br>There was a noise before Tina Barr spoke next, as though she shifted her position. She had gotten to her feet, perhaps angered by my comment. I stood up, too, as she pounded on the door. &quot;I know exactly what time it was when the man knocked, do you understand? It wasn't the middle of the night, Ms. Cooper. It was five o'clock.&quot;<br><br>All the cops and I had assumed the events had occurred within minutes of Schultz's arrival home. Fast, like most break-ins, and while the smoke bombs were steaming. We were wrong.<br><br>&quot;I apologize, Tina. That's even more reason for me to know what he did to you.&quot; I didn't want to suggest the word 'rape' to her. I needed her to reveal to me what had occurred.<br><br>&quot;I don't want to talk to any cops, Ms. Cooper. I'll tell you what happened if that will make them go away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm alone down here now. The men won't come in.&quot; I paused before I spoke again. &quot;I give you my word.&quot;<br><br>Tina Barr sniffled, then was quiet. I heard the deadbolt turn.<br><br><br>

I'm an assistant district attorney.&quot;<br><br>I stepped back and squared off so the woman inside the basement apartment could check me out. The hallway and staircase had been cleared of men in uniform, including the detail from Emergency Services poised to knock down her door with a battering ram, who were there when I arrived at the scene a short while ago at one o'clock in the morning.<br><br>I didn't hear any sound from within. No sense of her movement.<br><br>&quot;My name is Alexandra Cooper. You're Tina, aren't you? Tina Barr.&quot; I didn't say what my specialty was, that I was in charge of the DA's Office Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit. The police weren't certain she had been assaulted by the man who had earlier invaded her home, but several of them thought she might reveal those details to me if I could gain her confidence.<br><br>I moved in against the metal-clad door and pressed my ear to it, but heard nothing.<br><br>&quot;Don't lose your touch now, Coop.&quot; Mike Chapman walked down the steps and handed a light bulb to the rookie who was holding a flashlight over my shoulder. &quot;The money on the street's against you, but I'm counting on your golden tongue to talk the lady out so those guyscan go home and catch some sleep.&quot;<br><br>The young cop passed the bulb to Mercer Wallace, the six-foot-six-inch-tall detective from the Special Victims Unit who had called me to the brownstone on the quiet block between Lexington and Third Avenues in the East 90's. <br><br>Mercer reached overhead and screwed it in, illuminating the drab, cracked paint on the ceiling and walls of the hallway. &quot;Somebody--most likely the perp--shattered the other one. There are slivers of glass everywhere.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks, kid,&quot; Mike said, dismissing the rookie. &quot;No progress here, Detective Wallace?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We haven't got a homicide,&quot; I whispered to Mercer. &quot;And they sell light bulbs at the bodega on Lex. I don't know why you think we needed Mike, but please get him off my back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Damn, I've listened to Blondie charm full-on perverts into boarding the bus for a twenty-five-to-life time share at Sing-Sing. I've seen her coax confessions from the lying lips of the deranged and demented. I've watched as weak-willed men--&quot;<br><br>Mercer put his finger to his lips and pointed at the staircase.<br><br>&quot;Tina, these two detectives are my friends. I've worked with them for more than ten years.&quot; I paused to cough and clear my throat. There was still a bit of smoke wafting through the hallway. &quot;Can you tell me why you don't want to open up? Why it is you won't trust us? We're worried about your safety, Tina. About your physical condition.&quot;<br><br>Mercer pulled at my elbow. &quot;Let's go up for a break. Get some fresh air.&quot;<br><br>I stayed at the door for another few minutes and then followed Mike and Mercer to the small vestibule of the building and out onto the stoop. It was a mild October night, and neighbors returning to their homes, walking dogs, or hanging around the 'hood were checking on the police activity and trying to figure out what was wrong.<br><br>The uniformed sergeant from the 23rd Precinct whose team had been the first responders was on the sidewalk in front of the building, talking to Billy Schultz, the man who had called 911 an hour earlier.<br><br>&quot;What's the situation behind the house?&quot; Mike asked Mercer, as I caught up with them, on their way down the front steps.<br><br>&quot;Two cops stationed there. Small common garden for the tenants. Back doors from both the first floor and Barr's basement apartment, but no one has moved since they've been on site.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you know about the girl?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not much. Nobody seems to,&quot; Mercer said. He turned to the man standing with the sergeant, whom I guessed to be about forty, several years older than Mike and I. &quot;This is Mike Chapman, Billy. He's assigned to Night Watch.&quot;<br><br>Mike worked in Manhattan North Homicide, which helped staff the Night Watch unit, an elite squad of detectives on call between midnight and eight a.m., when precinct squads were most understaffed, to respond all over Manhattan to murders and situations like this one that the department referred to--with gross understatement--as &quot;unusuals.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Billy lives on the first floor,&quot; Mercer said. &quot;He's the guy who called 911.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good to meet you,&quot; Mike said. He turned to me. &quot;What's her name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tina Barr.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She your friend?&quot; he said to Billy.<br><br>&quot;We chat at the mailboxes occasionally. She's a quiet girl. Keeps to herself. Spent a lot of time gardening on weekends in the summer, so I ran into her out back every now and then, but I haven't seen her much since.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lived here long?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Me? Eighteen years?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tina sublets. A year, maybe more.&quot;<br><br>Mike ran his fingers through his thick black hair, looking from Billy to me. &quot;You sure she's in there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I could hear a woman crying when I first got here,&quot; I said. Whimpering was a more accurate word.<br><br>&quot;Tina was sobbing when I knocked on her door,&quot; Billy said.<br><br>&quot;But she wouldn't open up for you?&quot;<br><br>Billy Schultz adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose while Mike scrutinized him. &quot;No, sir.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why were you knocking? What made you call 911?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mercer gave us all this, Mike. Let me get back inside.&quot;<br><br>He held his arm out at me, palm perpendicular like a stop sign. &quot;Don't you want the chronology from the horse's mouth? Primary source. Catch me up, Billy.&quot;<br><br>I had one hand on the wrought-iron railing but stopped to listen.<br><br>&quot;I'm a graphic designer, detective. Worked late, stopped off for a burger and a couple of beers on my way home,&quot; Billy said. He was dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt. There were smudges of ink or paint on his jeans, too dark in color to be blood, I thought. &quot;It was about 12&#58;30 when I got near the building. That's when I saw this guy come tearing out the front door, down the steps.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What guy? Someone you know?&quot;<br><br>Billy Schultz shook his head. &quot;Nope. The fireman.&quot;<br><br>Mike looked to Mercer. &quot;Nobody told me about that. The fire department got here first?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not for real,&quot; Mercer said.<br><br>&quot;I mean I assumed he was a fireman. He was dressed in all the gear--coat, boots, hat--even had a protective mask of some kind on. That's why I couldn't see his face.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did you stop him? Did he talk to you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He flew by me, like there was a forest fire on Lexington Avenue he had to get to. Almost took me out. Even that didn't seem odd until I looked up the street for his truck, but there wasn't one around. Just weird.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What did you do then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I unlocked the door to the vestibule, and as soon as I got inside, I could smell smoke. I could see little waves of it sort of spiraling upward from the basement,&quot; Billy said. &quot;We don't have a super who lives in the building, so there was no one for me to call. I figured whatever happened had been resolved. By the guy I thought was a fireman. But I wanted to check it out, make sure there was nothing still burning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sarge, you want to get me that mask?&quot; Mercer said.<br><br>The older man walked to the nearest squad car and reached in for a paper bag while Billy Schultz talked.<br><br>&quot;I went downstairs first. It was pretty dark, but I could make out a small pile of rubble in the corner of the hallway, a couple of feet from Tina's door. Nothing was burning--no flames--but it was still smoldering. Kicking off a lot of smoke. That's when I knocked on her door.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did she answer?&quot; Mike asked.<br><br>&quot;No. Not then. I didn't hear anything. I figured maybe she wasn't home. I ran up to my apartment, filled a pitcher with water and came back down to douse whatever was still smoking. Figured the other firemen must have gone off to a bigger job and that the last one--the guy who almost plowed me down--was trying to catch up with them.&quot;<br><br>The sergeant passed the bag to Mercer, who put on a pair of latex gloves from his pocket before opening it.<br><br>&quot;It's when I went downstairs the second time that I heard Tina.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What did you hear, exactly?&quot; I asked.<br><br>Billy cocked his head and answered. &quot;I knocked again, just because I was worried that the firemen might have left her there even though there was still something smoldering in the hallway. She was weeping loudly, then pausing, like to inhale.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Words,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Did she speak any words?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, but I did. I told Tina it was me, asked her if she was alright. I was coughing myself from the smoke. I told her she could come up to my apartment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did she answer you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. She just cried.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How do you know it's Tina Barr you were talking to?&quot; Mike asked.<br><br>Billy hesitated. &quot;Well, at that point--I, uh--I just assumed it, detective. She lives there alone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What next?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I went home to get a bucket and broom. Swept some of the trash into the bucket to throw out on the street--&quot;<br><br>Mike glanced at the sergeant. &quot;Yeah, we got it, Chapman. Looks like amateur smoke bombs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The sobbing was so bad by then I called 911, from my cell. Maybe she was sick, overcome by the smoke. I waited out here on the stoop till the officers came. Three minutes. Not much longer. That's when Tina went berserk. That's when I knew it was her, for sure. I recognized her voice, when she was yelling at the cops.&quot;<br><br>Mercer removed a large black object from the bag and dangled it in front of us.<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Billy said. &quot;That's what the fireman had on his face.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Found it halfway up the block,&quot; the sergeant said. &quot;Right in the perp's flight path.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That's not department gear,&quot; Mike said. &quot;It's a gas mask. Military style.&quot;<br><br>It was a black rubber helmet, with two holes for the eyes, and a broad snout-like respirator that would fit over the mouth, with a long hose attached.<br><br>&quot;Couldn't see a damn thing,&quot; Billy said. &quot;It covered his entire face.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What did the cops do?&quot; Mike asked.<br><br>&quot;I led them down to the basement. They knocked on Tina's door and one of them identified himself, said they were police. That's when she started yelling at them to leave her alone. I mean screaming at them. Freaked out. Sounded like she collapsed--maybe fell onto the floor--crying the whole time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What makes you think she's alone in there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We're guessing,&quot; Mercer said. &quot;She's the only one to make a sound--no scuffling, no struggling, no other voices. But that's another reason ESU won't leave.&quot;<br><br>Mike started up the front steps toward me and prodded my side with his fingers. I went back in the vestibule toward the basement staircase.<br><br>&quot;One of the cops told Tina he just wanted to make sure that the fire hadn't affected her,&quot; Billy said, drawing a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his smoke-fogged glasses. &quot;Asked her if she could stand up and look through the peephole at his badge, for identification. She went wild.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mike asked.<br><br>&quot;Tina screamed at the cop. Told him that's how the guy got in. The fireman. That he showed her his badge and she opened the door.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was the fireman who was inside her apartment? You knew, Coop?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That's why Mercer called me. We don't know who the man was, why he was using such an elaborate disguise, why he went inside, and what he did to this woman. Okay? Don't come any closer, Mike. Let me talk to her.&quot;<br><br>I walked the short corridor to the rear of the hallway, glass crunching under the soles of my shoes.<br><br>&quot;Tina? It's Alex Cooper. We're all still here. The police officers won't leave until I convince them that you're unharmed. I'll keep them outside the building if you'll let me in for just a few minutes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'd rank that a toss up,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Ten minutes with you or the quick punch of a battering ram? Tough call.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You think this helps? You think she can't hear you?&quot; I threw up my arms in frustration as I turned to Mike. &quot;Mercer, please take him upstairs.&quot; <br><br>The men marched back to the first floor as I made another attempt to convince Tina Barr to let me in.<br><br>&quot;I'm the only one in the basement now, Tina.
