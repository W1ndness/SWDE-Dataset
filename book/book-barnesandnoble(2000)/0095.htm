His father, John Steinbeck, served as Monterey County Treasurer for many years. His mother, Olive Hamilton, was a former schoolteacher who developed in him a love of literature. Young Steinbeck came to know the Salinas Valley well, working as a hired hand on nearby ranches in Monterey County. In 1919, he graduated from Salinas High School as president of his class and entered Stanford University majoring in English. Stanford did not claim his undivided attention. During this time he attended only sporadically while working at a variety jobs including on with the Big Sur highway project, and one at Spreckels Sugar Company near Salinas. <p>    Steinbeck left Stanford permanently in 1925 to pursue a career in writing in New York City. He was unsuccessful and returned, disappointed, to California the following year. Though his first novel, <I>Cup of Gold</I>, was published in 1929, it attracted little literary attention. Two subsequent novels, <I>The Pastures of Heaven</I> and <I>To A God Unknown</I>, met the same fate. <p>    After moving to the Monterey Peninsula in 1930, Steinbeck and his new wife, Carol Henning, made their home in Pacific Grove. Here, not far from famed Cannery Row, heart of the California sardine industry, Steinbeck found material he would later use for two more works, <I>Tortilla Flat</I> and <I>Cannery Row</I>. <p>    With <I>Tortilla Flat</I> (1935), Steinbeck's career took a decidedly positive turn, receiving the California Commonwealth Club's Gold Medal. He felt encouraged to continue writing, relying on extensive research and personal observation of the human drama for his stories. In 1937, <I>Of Mice and Men</I> was published. Two years later, the novel was produced on Broadway and made into a movie. In 1940, Steinbeck won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction for <I>Grapes of Wrath</I>, bringing to public attention the plight of dispossessed farmers. <p>    After Steinbeck and Henning divorced in 1942, he married Gwyndolyn Conger. The couple moved to New York City and had two sons, Thomas and two years later, John. During the war years, Steinbeck served as a war correspondent for the <I>New York Herald Tribune</I>. Some of his dispatches reappeared in <I>Once There Was A War</I>. In 1945, Steinbeck published <I>Cannery Row</I> and continued to write prolifically, producing plays, short stories and film scripts. In 1950, he married Elaine Anderson Scott and they remained together until his death. <p>    Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962 "...for his realistic as well as imaginative writings, distinguished by a sympathetic humor and keen social perception.." In his acceptance speech, Steinbeck summarized what he sought to achieve through his works: <p>    "...Literature is as old as speech. It grew out of human need for it and it has not changed except to become more needed. The skalds, the bards, the writers are not separate and exclusive. From the beginning, their functions, their duties, their responsibilities have been decreed by our species...Further more, the writer is delegated to declare and to celebrate man's proven capacity of greatness of heart and spirit�gallantry in defeat, for courage, compassion and love. In the endless war against weakness and despair, these are the bright rally flags of hope and emulation. I hold that a writer who does not passionately believe in the perfectibility of man has no dedication nor any membership in literature..."<p>    Steinbeck remained a private person, shunning publicity and moving frequently in his search for privacy. He died on December 20, 1968 in New York City, where he and his family made a home. But his final resting place was the valley he had written about with such passion. At his request, his ashes were interred in the Garden of Memories cemetery in Salinas. He is survived by his son, Thomas. <p>    <I>Author biography courtesy of the National Steinbeck Center</I>.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><b>From the May/June 2002 issue of <i>Book</i> magazine</b><p>  The masterpiece <EM>The Grapes of Wrath</EM> appeared in 1939, when   the Depression had dragged on for nearly a decade and seemed to stretch endlessly ahead. Thousands of families had been dislodged from small farms in the Southwest, their plight exacerbated by drought  conditions and a moribund economy. Like the Joads of John Steinbeck's novel, these distraught families piled into old jalopies and headed west, to California, hoping for work and a better life. When they arrived, they discovered that Californians didn't need them or even want them. They were herded into dismal government "sanitary camps," where illness and hunger were pervasive.  <BR>  <BR>  Steinbeck was sent by a newspaper to report on the migrant situation. Notebook in hand, he toured the camps in an old bakery truck, driving up and down California's Central Valley, an area that he knew well from his childhood. In one of his first newspaper articles for <EM>The San Francisco News</EM>, Steinbeck described the predicament of the migrants who would inspire his novel:    <blockquote>They arrive in California usually having used up every resource to get here, even to the selling of the poor blankets and utensils and tools on the way to buy gasoline. They arrive bewildered and beaten and usually in a state of semi-starvation, with only one necessity to face immediately, and that is to find work at any wage in order that the family may eat.</blockquote>    In one camp, not far from Steinbeck's hometown of Salinas, he found about 2,000 people crammed into a pathetic shelter, many suffering from typhoid, flu, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. There was little food to be had, and the drinking water was foul. Once, when a riot broke out, the police squashed it brutally. "You couldn't fight back if you didn't feel good," Steinbeck wrote. "That was the secret the bosses and police had, and they knew they'd win."  <BR>  <BR>  After publishing his articles on the migrants, Steinbeck correctly guessed that his material was substantial enough to form the basis of a novel, and the first glimmerings of <EM>The Grapes of Wrath</EM> came into his head. In his journal, he wrote: "If only I could do this book properly it would be one of the really fine books and a truly American book." With eight books under his belt already, including 1937's <EM>Of Mice and Men</EM>, which had been a huge success as both a novel and a play, Steinbeck felt well prepared for the task at hand; indeed, he set to work with a vengeance.  <BR>  <BR>  He planned to write the book on an epic scale and decided it should alternate chapters of exposition and narrative. To keep it focused, he would center the story on one family, the Joads, tracking them from their farm in Oklahoma, along Route 66, and into California, where they would be forced into a camp with thousands of other "Okies" like themselves. The book, Steinbeck noted in the journal that he kept alongside the novel, would be composed "in a musical technique." He would try "to use the forms and the mathematics of music rather than those of prose." It would be "symphonic," he said, "in composition, in movement, in tone and in scope."  <BR>  <BR>  Steinbeck struggled to keep his concentration and remain disciplined, and one can follow his ups and downs in his journal. The entry for June 13, 1938, is typical. Steinbeck had been drinking with his friend Martin Ray the night before, and he came into his study the next day with a hangover:    <blockquote>Now a new week starts and unpropitiously for me. Last night up to Ray's and drank a great deal of champagne. I pulled my punches pretty well but I am not in the dead sober state I could wish. However, I will try to go to work. Don't have to because I have a day caught up. All sorts of things might happen in the course of this book, but I must not be weak. This must be done. The failure of will even for one day has a devastating effect on the whole, far more important than just the loss of time and wordage. The whole physical basis of the novel is discipline of the writer, of his material, of the language. And sadly enough, if any of the discipline is gone, all of it suffers. And this slight fuzziness of mine may be a break in the discipline. I don't know yet. But right now I intend to find out.</blockquote>    Despite the hangovers and self-doubts, the writing progressed with astonishing speed and fluency. Between May and October 1938, he produced a manuscript of 200,000 words, writing in longhand with Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky playing on the gramophone behind his desk. On September 3rd, he christened the book <EM>The Grapes of Wrath</EM>, a title suggested by his wife and plucked from "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." The narrative was completed on October 26th, when Steinbeck wrote in his journal: "Finished this day -- and I hope to God it's good."  <BR>  <BR>  Published in April 1939, <EM>The Grapes of Wrath</EM> became an enormous bestseller, winning critical praise from many of the best reviewers in the country. It also earned the Pulitzer Prize and was made into a film by director John Ford. Not surprisingly, the novel helped to focus national attention on the migrant situation. Popular first lady Eleanor Roosevelt supported the book, and her strong views were widely reported in the press.

with <EM>The Grapes of Wrath</EM> -- and Its Seismic Effects</b>
<BR>
<i>From the May/June 2002 issue of</i> Book <i>magazine.</i>
<BR>
<BR>
The masterpiece <EM>The Grapes of Wrath</EM> appeared in 1939, when 
the Depression had dragged on for nearly a decade and seemed to stretch endlessly ahead. Thousands of families had been dislodged from small farms in the Southwest, their plight exacerbated by drought
conditions and a moribund economy. Like the Joads of John Steinbeck's novel, these distraught families piled into old jalopies and headed west, to California, hoping for work and a better life. When they arrived, they discovered that Californians didn't need them or even want them. They were herded into dismal government "sanitary camps," where illness and hunger were pervasive.
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbeck was sent by a newspaper to report on the migrant situation. Notebook in hand, he toured the camps in an old bakery truck, driving up and down California's Central Valley, an area that he knew well from his childhood. In one of his first newspaper articles for <EM>The San Francisco News</EM>, Steinbeck described the predicament of the migrants who would inspire his novel:

<blockquote>They arrive in California usually having used up every resource to get here, even to the selling of the poor blankets and utensils and tools on the way to buy gasoline. They arrive bewildered and beaten and usually in a state of semi-starvation, with only one necessity to face immediately, and that is to find work at any wage in order that the family may eat.</blockquote>

In one camp, not far from Steinbeck's hometown of Salinas, he found about 2,000 people crammed into a pathetic shelter, many suffering from typhoid, flu, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. There was little food to be had, and the drinking water was foul. Once, when a riot broke out, the police squashed it brutally. "You couldn't fight back if you didn't feel good," Steinbeck wrote. "That was the secret the bosses and police had, and they knew they'd win."
<BR>
<BR>
After publishing his articles on the migrants, Steinbeck correctly guessed that his material was substantial enough to form the basis of a novel, and the first glimmerings of <EM>The Grapes of Wrath</EM> came into his head. In his journal, he wrote: "If only I could do this book properly it would be one of the really fine books and a truly American book." With eight books under his belt already, including 1937's <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0140177396"><EM>Of Mice and Men</EM></a>, which had been a huge success as both a novel and a play, Steinbeck felt well prepared for the task at hand; indeed, he set to work with a vengeance.

<p><b>NOTE
        TO THE TEACHER</b></p>
        <p>The questions, exercises, and assignments on these
        pages are designed to guide students' reading of the
        literary work and to provide suggestions for exploring
        the implications of the story through discussions,
        research, and writing. Most of the items can be handled
        individually, but small group and whole class discussions
        will enhance comprehension. The Response Journal should
        provide students with a means, first, for recording their
        ideas, feelings, and concerns, and then for reflecting
        these thoughts in their writing assignments and class
        discussions. These sheets may be duplicated, but teachers
        should select and modify items according to the needs and
        abilities of their students. </p>
        <p><font size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
        <p>Life during the Great Depression of the 1930's was
        extremely difficult for almost everyone. But for those
        who had little to begin with, it created often unbearable
        circumstances. By 1935, drought and poor farming
        practices, especially in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado,
        Kansas, and Texas, led to the wind erosion of topsoil. So
        severe was this problem that the affected areas of the
        Great Plains were labeled the Dust Bowl. At nearly the
        same time, the development of the all-purpose tractor
        enabled large landowners to dispense with the labor of
        farmers who were tenants on their land. By the late '30s,
        a majority of the approximately 1.8 million tenant
        farmers in the South had been evicted from their homes.
        Many of the displaced farmers sought work in the
        &quot;promised land&quot; of California. Eventually,
        there were as many as 300,000 migrants in California,
        several workers for every available job in the fertile
        farming valleys of that state.</p>
        <p>In 1936, John Steinbeck conducted research on the
        people who had moved to California from Arkansas and
        Oklahoma; in 1937, he toured the Dust Bowl and traveled
        with migrants on their relentless drive to California.
        From those experiences he wrote <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>,
        which upon publication in 1939 earned Steinbeck both high
        praise (including the Pulitzer Prize) and harsh criticism
        for its strong language and sociopolitical implications.
        The novel continues to be one of the most highly praised
        and vehemently criticized pieces of American literature.</p>
        <p><font size="3"><b>PREPARING
        TO READ</b></font></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In American history texts and other library
                sources, read about the Dust Bowl and other
                events of the Great Depression. If possible,
                obtain some of the famous 1930s photographs of
                poor farmers, migrant laborers, and people on
                city food lines. With other students, share what
                you see in the faces of those people. </li>
            <li>Discuss what happens when machines replace
                people. What alternatives do unskilled workers
                have when they are replaced? </li>
            <li>What is your definition of family? Is a family
                made up only of relatives? What keeps a family
                together? Of what importance is family unity in
                today's society? </li>
            <li>Obtain a road map of the United States and, as
                you read the first half of the novel, trace the
                route taken by the Joads, noting the location of
                major events along the way </li>
            <li>As you read through the novel, stop occasionally
                to record your thoughts, reactions, and concerns
                in a Response Journal. Your journal may be a
                separate notebook or individual sheets which you
                clip together and keep in a folder. Include
                statements about the characters - what you learn
                about them, how they affect you - and your
                thoughts about the key issues and events which
                the book explores. Also, jot down questions you
                have about events and statements in the book
                which you do not understand. Your Response
                Journal will come in handy when you discuss the
                novel in class, write a paper, or explore a
                related topic that interests you. In addition,
                because this novel contains several sophisticated
                words (e.g., petulant) and unusual expressions
                (e.g., frawny), you may want to keep a list of
                some of those words and their meanings in your
                journal.</li>

        </ol>
        <p><em><b>Digging Deeper</b></em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the beginning, each character has personal
                reasons for wanting to go to California. In what
                ways does each individual's goal change? Which
                people grow to see a larger purpose in life? What
                factors contribute to their changes? </li>
            <li>The heroes of <em>The Grapes of Wrath </em>are on
                the bottom of the social ladder; their language
                is often vile, their behavior is sometimes as
                coarse as their language, and they freely discuss
                bodily functions (which in the 1930s were seldom
                mentioned in literature). What was Steinbeck's
                purpose in portraying such unrefined and coarse
                people? What would be the effect on readers if
                the Joads spoke &quot;proper&quot; English and
                did not curse? </li>
            <li>According to statements made in this novel, of
                what importance is anger in overcoming fear? What
                must be done with anger in order to make it
                productive? Do you agree or disagree with that
                philosophy as expressed in this novel? </li>
            <li>What is the effect of the chapters which come
                between the narrative about the Joads? How would
                the elimination of those chapters affect the
                meaning and the impact of the novel? </li>
            <li>Identify as many Biblical references or parallels
                as you can find in the novel and discuss their
                effectiveness as well as their meaning. </li>
            <li>The political implications of this novel have
                been strongly attacked. In what ways is the novel
                a criticism of capitalism? Does the novel
                advocate communism? Defend your opinions with
                evidence from the novel. </li>
            <li>In what ways is your definition of the term
                family similar to the meaning Ma Joad gives to
                the term? In what ways is Ma Joad's meaning
                different? What do the implications of her
                meaning contribute to the author's message in the
                novel? </li>
            <li>If you had been an owner of a large California
                farm in 1939, how would you have felt about
                people like the Joads? As the owner of that farm,
                how might this novel have changed your feelings? </li>
            <li>Steinbeck wrote to his editor about this novel:
                &quot;I've done my damndest to rip a reader's
                nerves to rags, I don't want him satisfied.&quot;
                Did he succeed in doing that to you? If, so how
                did he accomplish it? If not, why weren't you
                affected in that way? </li>
            <li>Some critics maintain that this novel promotes
                hatred between classes of people. In what ways
                does it do that? In what ways does the novel's
                effect go beyond that? </li>
            <li>What has become of Noah? What does Connie do with
                the rest of his life? What will Tom become, and
                will he be successful at it? What will Al do
                next? How will these events change Rose of
                Sharon? </li>

        RESPONSES</b></font></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Explain the importance of the contrast between
                the dryness of the first part of the novel and
                the floods of the final part. Note also the
                frequent references to the sun as a &quot;large
                red drop&quot; that made a cloud look like a
                bloody rag and the earth look bloody. How do
                those images contribute to the meaning of the
                novel? </li>
            <li>Describe the role women play throughout this
                novel. Pay particular attention to the dialog
                between Ma and Pa Joad on page 467, and be sure
                to comment on the significance of Rose of
                Sharon's final act in the novel. </li>
            <li>Explain how Tom's imprisonment affected the way
                he behaved during the journey and throughout his
                search for work in California. </li>
            <li>Steinbeck describes the migrants as
                &quot;homeless, hardened, intent, and
                dangerous&quot; (p. 257). Write a newspaper
                editorial about those migrants as if you were the
                editor of a small town newspaper in California. </li>
            <li>Steinbeck admired the poor migrants and believed
                that from their enduring qualities &quot;will
                grow a new system and a new life which will be
                better than anything we have had before.&quot;
                Was he right? What kinds of changes have come
                about because of the suffering of those migrants
                of the '30s? In our society today, what similar
                problems exist? What problems in recent times
                have been exposed by writers the way Steinbeck
                did in <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>? </li>
            <li>Each of the characters in the novel had a dream
                of what he or she wanted in the future. Describe
                your own dreams and expectations for the future
                and explain how you intend to go about attaining
                them. </li>
            <li>Write a short story to describe what happens to
                the Wilsons after the Joads leave them behind. </li>
            <li>Write a factual newspaper account of the
                citizens' raid on the camp at Hooverville. </li>
            <li>Some Americans believe this novel is dirty,
                blasphemous, advocates a communistic society, and
                therefore should not be taught in high schools.
                Explain to parents in your town why you feel the
                novel should be read and studied in your high
                school, or explain to a group of teachers why you
                feel the novel should not be required.</li>

            <li>To learn of the angry reactions of Californians
                to <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>, read Frank J.
                Taylor's &quot;California's Grapes of
                Wrath,&quot; published in 1939. Similarly

                Reception of The Grapes of Wrath in
                Oklahoma,&quot; which appeared in 1944. Both are
                reprinted in The Viking Critical Library Edition
                of <em>The Grapes of Wrath: Text and Criticism</em>,
                edited by Peter Lisca. </li>

                Steinbeck's <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, or about a
                strike of migrant workers in his <em>In Dubious

            <li>Who are the migrant workers today in California?
                Are they better organized than the
                &quot;Okies&quot; were? What are the typical

                and other farm produce? Research the housing and
                living conditions for migrant workers in your

            <li>What is the percentage of small farms in the U.S.
                today? How do today's small farmers compete
                against the gigantic land-owners, and what are
                their relationships with today's bankers? What
                has changed for farmers since the 1930s and what
                problems still exist? </li>
            <li>View the 1940 film based on this novel (available
                on video tape). How closely do Nunnally Johnson's
                screenplay and John Ford's direction follow the
                events and the spirit of the book? </li>
            <li>Write an advertisement for jobs for migrant
                workers of the '30s. To what would you want to

            <li>Locate and play recordings of some of the music
                mentioned throughout this book, such as
                &quot;Ol'' Dan Tucker&quot; and &quot;Chicken
                Reel.&quot; In what ways is the music like the
                people in <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>? </li>
            <li>Locate drawings or photographs of some of the
                different types of automobiles mentioned in the
