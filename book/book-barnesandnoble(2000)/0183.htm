			Bargain</li></ul></div></div><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>David Halberstam's magisterial and thrilling <i>The Best and the Brightest</i> was the defining book for the Vietnam War.  More than three decades later, Halberstam used his unrivalled research and formidable journalistic skills to shed light on another dark corner in our history: the Korean War.  <i>The Coldest Winter</i> is a successor to <i>The Best and the Brightest</i>, even though in historical terms it precedes it.  Halberstam considered <i>The Coldest Winter</i> the best book he ever wrote, the culmination of forty-five years of writing about America's postwar foreign policy.</p><p>Up until now, the Korean War has been the black hole of modern American history.  <i>The Coldest Winter</i> changes that. Halberstam gives us a masterful narrative of the political decisions and miscalculations on both sides. He charts the disastrous path that led to the massive entry of Chinese forces near the Yalu, and that caught Douglas MacArthur and his soldiers by surprise. He provides astonishingly vivid and nuanced portraits of all the major figures -- Eisenhower, Truman, Acheson, Kim, and Mao, and Generals MacArthur, Almond, and Ridgway. At the same time, Halberstam provides us with his trademark highly evocative narrative journalism, chronicling the crucial battles with reportage of the highest order.</p><p>At the heart of the book are the individual stories of the soldiers on the front lines who were left to deal with the consequences of the dangerous misjudgements and competing agendas of powerful men. We meet them, follow them, and see some of the most dreadful battles in history through their eyes. As ever, Halberstam was concerned with the extraordinary courage and resolve of peopleasked to bear an extraordinary burden.</p><p><i>The Coldest Winter</i> is contemporary history in its most literary and luminescent form, and provides crucial perspective on the Vietnam War and the events of today. It was a book that Halberstam first decided to write more than thirty years ago and that took him nearly ten years to write. It stands as a lasting testament to one of the greatest journalists and historians of our time, and to the fighting men whose heroism it chronicles.</p><p>Includes an Afterword by Russell Baker</p>
</p><h3>The New York Times - 
												William Grimes</h3><p>Mr. Halberstam completed <i>The Coldest Winter</i> shortly before dying in a car accident this year. It caps a brilliant journalistic career in a particularly satisfying way since it serves as a kind of prequel to <i>The Best and the Brightest,</i> the book that grew out of his war reporting in Vietnam&#8230;The point of view that Mr. Halberstam developed in Vietnam&#151;sympathy for the enlisted men and junior officers, suspicion of the generals and politicians&#151;also informs his take on the Korean War. For the most part, <i>The Coldest Winter</i> is a straightforward history of that conflict, dependent almost entirely on secondary sources. It offers no new interpretation of the war, which lasted from 1950 until 1953. What animates the book, besides its sweeping vision of events, is the dozens of interviews Mr. Halberstam conducted with veterans: the privates, sergeants and lieutenants who slogged their way up and down the Korean peninsula at the mercy of delusional generals and ignorant politicians.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>One of the most popular and imitated nonfiction writers around, David Halberstam wrote books that fused narrative storytelling with investigative reporting.

											I read the other reviews before writing my own, which I hope clarifies a few aspects of this history. First, the title tells it all, this is history of the first year of the Korean War; so it only fleetingly discusses the last 3 years of the Korean stalemate.  Second, this history is more about the politics behind the war than it is about the fighting.  It primarily focuses on why the Korean War began, why we became involved, why General MacArthur was relieved of his command, and why U.S. policy ultimately resulted in a stalemate (a full scale war with China was deemed untenable).  Anyone who is primarily interested military history will be disappointed.  And I have to admit that I often tired of all the political intrigue regarding these events.  But one message is clear from this book, a message that is applicable to all wars, namely, that all wars are politically determined in their initiation, scope, and goals.  Unfortunately, how these wars are concluded rarely follows the script of those who initiated them or those who responded to the agression.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Biased and Badly Researched!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=GMCallen">GMCallen</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-1"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1334948_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781615538591_BK_2_1334948" href="#previewReview_1334948" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>March 14, 2010: 
											At the beginning of this book I thought this might be a very interesting read, but barely into the first chapter I already find that without any factual information he starts bashing General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Instead maybe he should do a little more research concerning the Commander. MacArthur wasn't the problem in Korea it was Liberal administration attitudes who tied his hands. I largely think General MacArthur possible could have ended the war allot sooner if they had let the commander DO HIS JOB and save lives! Again if you had read transcripts from back then you would find that he never did anything without the approval of the JCS or President Truman (who often would wait long periods without making decisions). The author really should go back and read some biographies concerning the General such as &quot;Reminiscences by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur&quot; maybe this would have changed his attitude.

The resulting books -- many of them huge bestsellers -- gave Halberstam heavyweight status (he won the Pulitzer for international reporting in 1964) and established him as an important commentator on American politics and power.    <p>Halberstam was also known for his sports books. In <I>The Breaks of the Game</I>, which a critic for <I>The New York Times</I> called "one of the best books I've ever read about American sports," he took on professional basketball.<p>     In <I>The Amateurs</I>, he examined the world of sculling; in <I>Summer of '49</I> and <I>October 1964</I>, he focused on two pivotal baseball events: the Boston Red Sox's exasperating near victory over the New York Yankees for the 1949 pennant, and the 1964 season, when the Yankees lost the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1999's <I>Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made</I>, Halberstam documented the making of a legend.   <p>Always happy to extend his reach well beyond the subject at hand, Halberstam packed his books with social commentary as well as sports detail.<p>  His writing routine was as strenuous and disciplined as that of any of the athletes he wrote about. To sustain his steady output of extensively researched, almost-always-massive books, he allows no unscheduled interruptions: "Most of us who have survived here [New York] after a number of years have ironclad work rules. Nothing interrupts us. Nothing," he once wrote in <I>The New York Times</I>. "We surface only at certain hours of the day."</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>David Halberstam's first job</b> was as a reporter for a small-town Mississippi newspaper.</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><i>Halberstam discussed his book</i> Firehouse <i>with Barnes & Noble.</i><p>    <b><i>Firehouse</i> is about a single Manhattan firehouse and what befell its men on 9/11. You normally write on a much larger scale -- what prompted you to write this story?</b><br>    I think a writer should be able to write on any scale, large or small, adjusting the mood and texture of the writing to the events he or she is writing about. I've written on a small scale before -- in any number of my sports books and to some degree in a book I wrote on the civil rights kids I knew, <i>The Children</i>. I think the writing should fit the needs of the story. In this case, an apocalyptic event hit one intensely human institution located very near my home, and I wanted to tell the story of the men and the women who had their lives torn apart by that terrible day -- who they were and why they did what they did. And I suppose I wanted to do it because I'm a New Yorker and the assault on the World Trade Center was very personal, an assault on the city I live in.  <p>  <b> From reading your book, it almost seems that the men who were off duty that day have suffered as much, if not more than, those who perished. Why do you think that is?</b><br>    It's because the firehouse is so much an extended family. The men live together and eat together and risk their lives together, and so in any real sense they are family. The relationships are very close. The very nature of the job brings out a rare dependency -- if you don't do your job well, the fireman next to you may lose his life. You can't say that about many peacetime jobs. And of course, the firemen always knew there were going to be bad days when sometimes you lose a man, or very bad days when you might lose two. But to lose 12 men from a house and 343 from a department -- so large a part of an immediate family -- that's something none of them could have imagined, not in their wildest, darkest nightmare.  <p>  So it's very hard to lose so many loved ones, and of course there's always survivor's guilt. That is, the other men who were off that day wondering why they lived and their closest friends died.  <p>  <b>What kind of man walks into a burning building, when everyone else is running out?</b><br>    I think there's a nobility to the men I dealt with, a certain unstated religious calling to what they do. It's not something they talk about, but it's there. I think it has to be -- after all, there's a willingness to sacrifice your life for complete strangers. When I was a young reporter in Vietnam almost 40 years ago, I saw great acts of heroism, but when someone scrambled under fire to rescue another grunt, he was always saving a buddy. But the firemen do it for strangers. So it's part of a calling, and I feel it has serious religious overtones.  <p>  <b>Many of the lost firefighters were following in their fathers' footsteps. Do you think the sons of those who died saving others will carry on that tradition?</b><br>    I think there is a code to the firemen that I've dealt with, and from the time they go into the department, they have made the decision to take a certain kind of risk. And the risk can be terrifying, even though it is not necessarily a daily thing. But it's always there -- the sense that the next fire might be the one that you don't come back from, that there are no immunities. And so I think the firehouse has codes that work toward sustaining that special unflinching quality of courage, toward making almost reflexive those traditional values and willingness to take risks. You have to do the right thing because you may endanger your fellow firemen if you don't.  <p>  <b> What was it like spending so much time with the surviving firefighters, as they coped with the tragedy?</b><br>    I liked the men very much, and I liked all the families very much. I liked the sense of humor and how straightforward everyone was. I liked the high sense of civic virtue -- that these are men who feel they want to use their lives for something larger than themselves. If you work as a reporter for 47 years in a democratic society as I have, one of the things that keep you going, is, for lack of a better phrase, the nobility of ordinary people. It's what democracy is premised on -- that at difficult moments, ordinary people will stand up and do uncommon things. And I found that at the firehouse.  <p>  In addition, the fact that no one there does "spin" -- that is, try to con you -- is thrilling. So all in all it was very rewarding for me as a journalist; I felt very much like the young reporter that I had been in Vietnam a long time ago, that being a journalist really mattered. And I like the raucous, sardonic nature of firehouse humor. Just the other day, one of my pals who likes to drink a bit was undergoing blood tests. There was fear he had hepatitis C. And the joke at the firehouse was that they all hoped that the tests would show that it was only cancer because then he could keep on drinking.  <p>  <b>What's the mood at the firehouse right now?</b><br>    I think it's a very hard time. I think for a time the men were all carried forward by how much they had to do -- looking for the bodies, dealing with the families of their dead colleagues, dealing with all the public rituals and ceremonies. And now that that's all done with the reality really starts sinking in -- that they lost 12 good friends and it's never going to change. Never. In the end the reality is unbearable. Their friends are never coming back. And that's very hard.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>One military historian called it "the century's nastiest little war." The three-year Korean Conflict (1950-53) was certainly that, but for Americans, it is also "the forgotten war," a protracted struggle that, as David Halberstam noted, "sometimes seemed to have been orphaned by history." The author of <i>The Best and the Brightest</i> rescues this early Cold War confrontation from oblivion with a commanding narrative that encompasses every facet of the war, from wounded G.I.s belly-crawling across bloody battlefields to world leaders coolly debating strategies and consequences. Whatever his quarry, Halberstam keeps his focus at the human level; his detail-rich portraits of Truman, MacArthur, Mao, Matthew Ridgway, and George Kennan (to name but a few) bring them to life as people.
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>David Halberstam's magisterial and thrilling <i>The Best and the Brightest</i> was the defining book for the Vietnam War.  More than three decades later, Halberstam used his unrivalled research and formidable journalistic skills to shed light on another dark corner in our history: the Korean War.  <i>The Coldest Winter</i> is a successor to <i>The Best and the Brightest</i>, even though in historical terms it precedes it.  Halberstam considered <i>The Coldest Winter</i> the best book he ever wrote, the culmination of forty-five years of writing about America's postwar foreign policy.</p><p>Up until now, the Korean War has been the black hole of modern American history.  <i>The Coldest Winter</i> changes that. Halberstam gives us a masterful narrative of the political decisions and miscalculations on both sides. He charts the disastrous path that led to the massive entry of Chinese forces near the Yalu, and that caught Douglas MacArthur and his soldiers by surprise. He provides astonishingly vivid and nuanced portraits of all the major figures -- Eisenhower, Truman, Acheson, Kim, and Mao, and Generals MacArthur, Almond, and Ridgway. At the same time, Halberstam provides us with his trademark highly evocative narrative journalism, chronicling the crucial battles with reportage of the highest order.</p><p>At the heart of the book are the individual stories of the soldiers on the front lines who were left to deal with the consequences of the dangerous misjudgements and competing agendas of powerful men. We meet them, follow them, and see some of the most dreadful battles in history through their eyes. As ever, Halberstam was concerned with the extraordinary courage and resolve of peopleasked to bear an extraordinary burden.</p><p><i>The Coldest Winter</i> is contemporary history in its most literary and luminescent form, and provides crucial perspective on the Vietnam War and the events of today. It was a book that Halberstam first decided to write more than thirty years ago and that took him nearly ten years to write. It stands as a lasting testament to one of the greatest journalists and historians of our time, and to the fighting men whose heroism it chronicles.</p><p>Includes an Afterword by Russell Baker</p>
</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								William Grimes</h3><p>Mr. Halberstam completed <i>The Coldest Winter</i> shortly before dying in a car accident this year. It caps a brilliant journalistic career in a particularly satisfying way since it serves as a kind of prequel to <i>The Best and the Brightest,</i> the book that grew out of his war reporting in Vietnam&#8230;The point of view that Mr. Halberstam developed in Vietnam&#151;sympathy for the enlisted men and junior officers, suspicion of the generals and politicians&#151;also informs his take on the Korean War. For the most part, <i>The Coldest Winter</i> is a straightforward history of that conflict, dependent almost entirely on secondary sources. It offers no new interpretation of the war, which lasted from 1950 until 1953. What animates the book, besides its sweeping vision of events, is the dozens of interviews Mr. Halberstam conducted with veterans: the privates, sergeants and lieutenants who slogged their way up and down the Korean peninsula at the mercy of delusional generals and ignorant politicians.</p><h3>The New York Times Book Review - 
								Max Frankel</h3><p>Halberstam, a vibrant 73, was killed in a car crash last April. There can be no consolation for that loss, but perhaps solace of a kind in knowing that just five days earlier he had finished his most operatic war story, <i>The Coldest Winter,</i> about the Korean War of 1950-53&#8230;Combining his typically prodigious research with more than a hundred interviews, Halberstam has graphically (if sometimes tediously) recreated the trench warfare up and down that frozen peninsula, juxtaposing accounts of the petty backstabbing and vainglorious posturing at the Tokyo headquarters of Gen. Douglas MacArthur and the catastrophic miscalculations by Truman, Stalin, Mao and Kim Il Sung of North Korea. The result is an outsize but fascinating epic directed simultaneously to battle buffs and pacifists, history enthusiasts and political moralists. With sometimes numbing detail and elegant maps, it evokes the nobility and crazy heroism of outnumbered American grunts in a dozen of the war's critical engagements, cinematic scenes that alternate with crisp essays about the mindless way the war began, the reckless way it was managed and the fruitless way it ended.</p><h3>Jonathon Keats

								Forbes</h3><p>"Seldom has a more unpopular man fired a more popular one," proclaimed <I>Time</I> magazine in April 1951, announcing President Harry Truman's decision to recall General Douglas MacArthur from Korea. Arguably the most memorable moment in America's least remembered war, it was also the rare decisive battle in a vaguely understood, three-year-long stalemate. "Korea [did] not prove a great national war of unifying singular purpose, as World War II had been, nor [did] it, like Vietnam a generation later, divide and thus haunt the nation," writes David Halberstam in <I>The Coldest Winter</I>. "Korea was a war that sometimes seemed to have been orphaned by history." In his ex-traordinary final book, completed days before his untimely death, Halberstam brings his renowned command of history to that era, rescuing the war from near oblivion through interviews with soldiers and excavation of archives. What emerges, over more than 700 riveting pages, is a detailed battlefield account coupled with a keen examination of how the war was perceived, as it progressed, by key figures including Truman, Mao and Stalin. All angles are considered, even the legacy of Pinky MacArthur, Douglas' overweening mother, in the General's attempt to wage war with China against the President's wishes. Halberstam's multifaceted analysis is a model not only for future historians but also for aspiring statesmen.</p><h3>Booklist</h3><p>Commanding and evocative . . . Halberstam's final work stands as the coda to his enduringly famous <i>The Best and the Brightest</i>. (starred review)
</p><h3>Harold G. Moore</h3><p>"I could hardly put this book down. Meticulously and thoroughly researched, it is splendidly compelling reading. <i>The Coldest Winter</i> is a superb conjoining of all the factors of this tragic war: the military tactics and strategy of both sides; the international diplomacy; the internal politics; the personalities of the various players. A great work."--(Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.), co-author of <i>We Were Soldiers Once . . .and Young</i>)
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>At the heart of David Halberstam's massive and powerful new history of the Korean War is a bloody, losing battle fought in November 1950 in the snow-covered mountains of North Korea by outnumbered American GIs and Marines against the Chinese Communist Army.</P><P>Halberstam's villain is not North Korea's Kim Il Sung or China's Chairman Mao or even the Soviet Union's Josef Stalin, who pulled the strings. It's the legendary general Douglas MacArthur, the aging, arrogant, politically ambitious architect of what the author calls "the single greatest American military miscalculation of the war," MacArthur's decision "to go all the way to the Yalu [River] because he was sure the Chinese would not come in."</P><P>Much of the story is familiar. What distinguishes this version by Halberstam (who died this year in a California auto crash) is his reportorial skill, honed in Vietnam in Pulitzer-winning dispatches to the <I>New York Times</I>. His pounding narrative, in which GIs and generals describe their coldest winter, whisks the reader along, even though we know the ending.</P><P>Most Korean War scholars agree that MacArthur's sprint to the border of great China with a Siberian winter coming on resulted in a lethal nightmare. Though focused on that mountain battle, Halberstam's book covers the entire war, from the sudden dawn attack by Kim Il Sung's Soviet-backed North Koreans against the U.S.-trained South, on June 25, 1950, to its uneasy truce in 1953. It was a smallish war but a big Cold War story: Harry Truman, Stalin and Mao, Joe McCarthy and Eisenhower, George C. Marshall and Omar Bradley, among others, stride through it. A few quibbles: there were no B-17 bombers destroyed on WakeIsland the day after Pearl Harbor, as Halberstam asserts, and Halberstam gives his minor characters too much attention.</P><P>At first MacArthur did well, toughing out those early months when the first GIs sent in from cushy billets in occupied Japan were overwhelmed by Kim's rugged little peasant army. MacArthur's greatest gamble led to a marvelous turning point: the invasion at Inchon in September, when he outflanked the stunned Reds. </P><P>After Inchon, the general headed north and his luck ran out. His sycophants, intelligence chief Willoughby and field commander Ned Almond, refused to believe battlefield evidence indicating the Chinese Communists had quietly infiltrated North Korea and were lying in wait.

								Library Journal</h3><p><P>This final work by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author (<i>The Best and the Brightest</i>), who died in April, looks at the "Forgotten War." Not a battle history, it concentrates largely on the politics of the situation and how the Truman administration found itself fighting a war it did not want with a commander it could not trust. Much of the book concerns the MacArthur headquarters and the general's insistence on carrying out his own agenda rather than Washington's. The author expresses a great deal of anger at Col. Charles Willoughby, MacArthur's intelligence chief, who baldly falsified his estimates to agree with the boss's fanciful preconceptions of the Chinese. The result was a huge U.S. military debacle culminating in the disastrous retreat from the Yalu in 1951. Halberstam offers interesting discussions of the China Lobby and the effect it had on the debate. The run-up to the war and the first year are covered in great detail, but the book gets sketchier after Matthew Ridgway's assumption of supreme command in 1951. Some rough organization and lack of narrative covering the later years suggest that Halberstam's death may have cut short his work. Still, this is a vital, accessibly written resource for students of the period and is sure to be widely read. Recommended for most collections.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>The master journalist's 21st and final book: a magisterial account of the Korean War. Halberstam's latest (The Education of a Coach, 2005, etc.) is a vivid chronicle packed with anecdotes and the stories of great men. North Korea's Kim Il-Sung was a loyal Stalinist. America had installed Syngman Rhee in the South because he was Christian, spoke English and was the only Korean known in Washington. Halberstam describes both as thoroughly unpleasant autocrats but fierce nationalists, each equally anxious to unite Korea under his own leadership. Kim yearned to invade, but Stalin refused to provoke America until 1950, when he gave reluctant permission. Far East Commander Douglas MacArthur insisted North Korea would never attack; after being proven wrong, he remained mysteriously inactive for several days. Everyone feared Stalin was launching World War III and cheered Truman's decision to intervene. At first, MacArthur handled the defense competently; his brilliant behind-the-lines landing at Inchon in September 1950 shattered North Korea's army. Ignoring Washington's suggestions to stop at the 38th parallel, MacArthur pushed north toward the Chinese border, despite good intelligence that Chinese units were pouring south. Once again, he dithered when disaster struck and did little to rally his defeated forces. A national icon but detested by his superiors, MacArthur finally overstepped by loudly advocating total war against China. Truman dismissed him, an act now considered courageous that at the time outraged the nation. MacArthur's successor, WWII hero Matthew Ridgway, performed brilliantly in stopping the Chinese, but more than two years of bloody stalemate followed. As America's firstmodern war without victory, Korea was the conflict everyone wanted to forget. It was a black hole of history, Halberstam writes, a war with China that never should have happened. Another memorable slice of 20th-century history, measuring up to such earlier Halberstam classics as The Best and the Brightest (1972) and The Powers That Be (1979).

The First Battalion -- with its attached unit of tanks and artillery, in reality a battalion task force -- was the most exposed of the regiment's three battalions, positioned about four hundred yards north of the town of Unsan. Boyd's battalion commander, Jack Millikin, Jr., had been his tactical officer at West Point, and Boyd thought him a good, steady man. As far as Boyd knew, their battalion was up there alone -- they had been the first of the three battalions out of Pyongyang, and he had no idea whether the rest of the regiment was following. That first afternoon, right after they arrived, they registered their mortars on some surrounding targets, and there were even brief exchanges of fire with the enemy, but the action was light, and everyone had assumed it was North Korean stragglers. That night, though, Boyd was called over by his company commander, who had just been briefed at Battalion. The word Boyd got was: "There are twenty thousand laundrymen in the area." Boyd knew what that meant -- twenty thousand Chinese near them.<br><br>
Then they heard musical instruments, like weird Asian bagpipes. Some of the officers thought for a moment that a British brigade was arriving to help them out. But it was not bagpipes; instead it was an eerie, very foreign sound, perhaps bugles and flutes, a sound many of them would remember for the rest of their lives. It was the sound they would come to recognize as the Chinese about to enter battle, signaling to one another by musical instrument what they were doing, and deliberately striking fear into their enemy as well. Boyd believed his men were in decent positions, though they were not a full platoon in his mind. Nearly half of them were KATUSAs, Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army, poorly trained Korean soldiers attached to American units who, most American officers believed, could not be relied on if there was a serious fight. They were there to beef up American units, to make the UN forces look larger on paper, if not in battle, than they really were. It was an experiment that no one liked, not the company commanders, not the American troops who fought alongside the Koreans but could not communicate with them, and certainly not the KATUSAs themselves, who more often than not gave every sign of wanting very badly to be almost anywhere else.<br><br>
At roughly 10:30 p.m., the Chinese struck. It was stunning how quickly something could fall apart, Boyd thought. The American units were so thinly positioned that the Chinese seemed to race right through their fragile lines, almost like a track meet, some of the men later said. What had once been a well organized battalion CP (command post) quickly disintegrated. Some of the survivors from different platoons tried to form a makeshift last-second perimeter, but they were quickly overpowered. There were wounded everywhere. Millikin was handling the growing chaos as best he could, Boyd thought, trying to put together a convoy with about ten deuce-and-a-half trucks and loading as many wounded as possible onto them. At that moment, Boyd ran into Captain Emil Kapaun, an Army chaplain who was tending to a number of wounded. Boyd offered to assign the priest to one of the trucks, but Father Kapaun refused. He planned to stay with the wounded men who would not be able to get out on their own. They would have to surrender, he was sure, but he would do all he could to offer the wounded some modest protection.<br><br>
The battalion had two tanks, and when the convoy finally took off, it was with Millikin aboard the lead tank and the other tank bringing up the rear with Boyd on top of it. About a mile south of Unsan, the road split, one branch veering southeast, the other in a southwesterly direction, through the edge of the Third Battalion position and over the bridge that Bill Richardson and his weapons section were guarding. Millikin blindly headed them southeast. That any of the men made it out at all came from that choice.<br><br>
The Chinese had set up a formidable force on both sides of the road, waiting to ambush them. It was hard to measure distance or time in those moments when the enemy was striking with such force, but Boyd thought his convoy got about five or six hundred yards down the road before the Chinese opened up. Their firepower was overwhelming, and the convoy, with so many wounded, had almost no means of fighting back. In the confusion -- the vehicles all had their lights off -- the driver of Boyd's tank panicked and began to rotate his turret wildly. The dozen or so men on top were all knocked off, and Boyd promptly found himself sprawled in a ditch. Later, he would decide that he survived only by the grace of God.<br><br>
He could hear the Chinese approaching. His only chance was to play dead. Soon, they started beating on him with their rifle butts and kicking him. Luckily, no one used a bayonet. Finally, they rummaged through his pockets, took his watch and his ring, and left. He waited for what seemed an eternity, hours at least, and then slowly started to crawl away, totally disoriented, suffering from a concussion, among other wounds. In the distance, he could hear artillery fire, and, assuming it was the Americans, he headed that way. He hobbled across a stream, probably the Nammyon, and discovered that his leg was in terrible pain. He realized that he had been badly burned, probably from the white phosphorous the Chinese were firing.<br><br>
Boyd moved cautiously in the next few days, at night, hiding as best he could during the day. He was out there at least a week, maybe ten days, trying to work his way back to American lines, in constant pain and voraciously hungry. He was helped by one Korean farmer, who fed him and, using primitive hand signals, directed him toward the American positions. He was sure he would not have made it without the farmer's help. Around November 15, after a trek of almost two weeks, Boyd reached an American unit. He was immediately sent to a series of hospitals -- his burns were serious indeed. His Korean War was over. He was one of the lucky ones. He had no idea how many of his platoon had died, only that the company commander had been killed.
