In those years before television, we lived in a city of legend and myth called New York. I lived in a tenement in Brooklyn. Doctorow was a resident of the distant Bronx. In our separate worlds, we shared the same myths. Most of the tales were oral, full of gangsters and ballplayers and occasional heroes. But our imaginations were also fed by the written word. By books, usually borrowed from the public library, and by newspapers. <br><br>

      Then one morning in March those newspapers gave us a brand-new myth: the tale of the Collyer brothers: Homer and Langley. On March 21st, someone made a call to the police, saying that there was a dead man in the four-story brownstone at 2078 Fifth Avenue, on the corner of 128th Street in Harlem. The cops knew the house for its two ancient inhabitants, its boarded-up windows, its vile summer stench. Neighbors knew the men as ghostly nocturnal figures.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="readFullReviewContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">Read the Full Review</a></strong><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>From <b>Ragtime </b>and <b>Billy Bathgate</b> to <b>The Book of Daniel, World&#8217;s Fair,</b> and <b>The March</b>, the novels of E. L. Doctorow comprise one of the most substantive achievements of modern American fiction. Now, with <b>Homer &amp; Langle</b>y, this master novelist has once again created an unforgettable work.<br><br>Homer and Langley Collyer are brothers&#8211;the one blind and deeply intuitive, the other damaged into madness, or perhaps greatness, by mustard gas in the Great War. They live as recluses in their once grand Fifth Avenue mansion, scavenging the city streets for things they think they can use, hoarding the daily newspapers as research for Langley&#8217;s proposed dateless newspaper whose reportage will be as prophecy. Yet the epic events of the century play out in the lives of the two brothers&#8211;wars, political movements, technological advances&#8211;and even though they want nothing more than to shut out the world, history seems to pass through...
</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Michael Dirda</h3><p>&#8230;as with his much admired novels <i>The Book of Daniel, Ragtime, Billy Bathgate</i> and <i>The March,</i> Doctorow again creatively reconfigures and amplifies the historical record&#8230;There's a briskness to <i>Homer & Langley</i> that never flags, and its solitary protagonists&#151;two lost souls&#151;possess a half-comical, half-nightmarish fascination. They seem, at once, symbols of both American materialism and of American loneliness. Think of Melville's "isolatoes," or of all those forlorn men in shirt sleeves and the dispirited women of Edward Hopper's paintings, or of Hank Williams singing "I'm so lonesome I could cry."</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>Few writers have succeeded as E. L. Doctorow has at creating stories (largely based in 1930s New York) that evoke both warm, personal memory and a grander national portrait.

											I enjoyed this fascinating journey through history from the viewpoint of the two brothers.  <p/><p/>But I don't recommend this book as an e-book until B &amp; N fixes the problem with the disappearing margins.  Half-way through the book, the nicely spaced margins disappeared.  This was on the Medium Font setting.  The words were right next to the edges of the screen which made for uncomfortable reading.  I just read a review of another e-book and a similar problem was described as an 'e-book format problem'.  <p/><p/>This is only the second book I've purchased to read on my new Nook.    Barnes &amp; Noble should not release books in e-book form until they get the formatting correct.  I look forward to reading many more books on my Nook and trust this book-seller will address this issue.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Collecting the 20th Century!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=Illiniforever">Illiniforever</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1315321_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781400064946_BK_24_1315321" href="#previewReview_1315321" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>February 20, 2010:

In those years before television, we lived in a city of legend and myth called New York. I lived in a tenement in Brooklyn. Doctorow was a resident of the distant Bronx. In our separate worlds, we shared the same myths. Most of the tales were oral, full of gangsters and ballplayers and occasional heroes. But our imaginations were also fed by the written word. By books, usually borrowed from the public library, and by newspapers. <br><br>

      Then one morning in March those newspapers gave us a brand-new myth: the tale of the Collyer brothers: Homer and Langley. On March 21st, someone made a call to the police, saying that there was a dead man in the four-story brownstone at 2078 Fifth Avenue, on the corner of 128th Street in Harlem. The cops knew the house for its two ancient inhabitants, its boarded-up windows, its vile summer stench. Neighbors knew the men as ghostly nocturnal figures. <br><br>

      To be sure, the brothers, like the house they lived in, were survivors from another time. In the late 19th century, Harlem was white and prosperous, a perfect setting for characters out of Edith Wharton's splendid fictions. The Collyer brothers did not grow up rich; but they were "well off." Their father was a doctor. Their mother had ambitions to sing opera. The 1947 newspapers said that Homer was born in 1881 (the year that Henry James published <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> and some other mythic Americans fought the gunfight at the O.K. Corral). His brother Langley arrived in 1885.  They moved into the house in 1909 and stayed on after the parents died. In March 1947, when the cops started investigating the report of a death, the revelations burst from the front pages of newspapers. Thousands of New Yorkers started arriving in Harlem for a look. <br><br>

      Far away in Brooklyn, the emerging myth of the Collyer brothers was made personal to us because one of our neighbors, a detective named Joe Whitmore, was assigned to the investigation. "You never seen anything like that place," he told my father one morning, while I listened in awe. "It's like a trip to Purgatory." His eyewitness accounts of filth, rats, newspapers stacked to ceilings, pianos everywhere (14 of them), a Model T automobile, and narrow tunnels through the densely packed trash were verified by the newspaper stories. Or, rather, Joe Whitmore verified the newspaper stories. <br><br>

      The cops found Homer first. He was propped up in a chair, crippled and twisted by rheumatism, his hair wild and white, his beard falling below his chest. He wore only a tattered blue bathrobe. He had starved to death. They didn't find Langley for another three weeks. Despite reports of sightings all over New York and as far away as Atlantic City, his body lay only eight feet away from Homer's, crushed by thick walls of trash he had rigged as a booby trap. Rats had been dining on his aging flesh. <br><br>

      Within days of the first discoveries, the Collyer brothers had entered the mythology of New York, while becoming part of the city's language for at least two generations. Millions of New York mothers must have scolded their children with variations on the same lines: "Look at this room! You guys are like the Collyer brothers!"  In my own life, even today, I aim the same accusing words at myself, gazing at the thousands of books, magazines, newspapers that I'm so reluctant to throw away. I never call myself Homer, or Langley, but I often feel like a card-carrying member of the Collyer brotherhood. <br><br>

       Now E.&nbsp;L. Doctorow has brought his extraordinary literary art to bear on this enduring New York story. The result is a wonderful novel.  As in <em>The Book of Daniel, Ragtime, The Waterworks, Billy Bathgate,</em> and other fictions, Doctorow is here less concerned with factual truth than with imagining the lives within the myth. This is not unique to him. After all, Stephen Crane did not fight in the Civil War. Leonardo da Vinci was not present at the Last Supper. <br><br>

         For Doctorow, history is almost always the first draft of myth. But it is more than that too. In my reading, what distinguishes him from most other makers of historical fictions is that he approaches the subject matter like a musician. Sometimes directly -- it was impossible for me to read <em>Ragtime </em>without hearing Scott Joplin. In this new novel, I hear John Coltrane, the great tenor sax player. The first line is certainly as direct as Coltrane. <br><br>

         <em>"I'm Homer, the blind brother."</em><br><br>
          The notes that matter are "blind" and "brother." But the narration goes on as Homer explains how he realized in his late teens what was happening to him. He would stand near the lake in Central Park in winter when it was filled with ice skaters. <br><br><P style="MARGIN: 0px 20px">
The houses over to Central Park West went first, they got darker as if dissolving into the dark sky until I couldn't make them out, and then the trees began to lose their shape, and then finally, this was toward the end of the season, maybe it was late February of that very cold winter, and all I could see were these phantom shapes of the ice skaters floating past me on a field of ice, and then the white ice, that last light, went gray and then altogether black, and then all my sight was gone though I could hear clearly the scoot scut of the blades on the ice, a very satisfying sound, a soft sound though full of intention, a deeper tone than you'd expect made by the skate blades, perhaps for having sounded the resonant basso of the water under the ice, scoot scut, scoot scut. 

<P style="MARGIN: 0px"><br>
       In this and other passages, Doctorow brilliantly gives us the sense of blindness in all its varieties, including its compensations. Homer Collyer learns to see through sound and smell and texture. In Doctorow's version of the myth, Homer is also a trained musician, saying early that "my skill as a pianist rendered my blindness acceptable in the social world."  He goes to dinner parties with his older brother Langley and often plays for the guests and the young women. Langley goes off to World War One and comes back a changed, obsessive man. In "real" life, the musician was Langley, not Homer, and Homer was older than Langley by four years. Langley apparently did not serve in World War One (too old). This playing with the facts doesn't truly matter, any more than the true story of Frankie and Johnny matters, or the biography of Stagger Lee. What should matter in a work of imagined art is the imagination and the art. <br><br>

       Doctorow supplies both, in what is a story of a grand refusal of the world and its conventions. The brothers eventually ask nothing of the world. No charity. No acclaim. They want to be left alone. There is a brief time when servants provide the illusion of family, but eventually they leave. One, a young Irish girl, is the object of Homer's affections, but she goes off to become a nun. Homer says at one point, about a girl he met at summer camp: "Is there any love purer than this, when you don't even know what it is?" But the most enduring love story in Doctorow's novel is the love of each brother for the other. <br><br>

       Homer always speaks with affection about Langley, even realizing that his brother's habit of collecting things might be getting out of hand. Newspapers were a huge problem. Langley's major project was "the collection of the daily papers with the ultimate aim of creating one day's edition of a newspaper that could be read forevermore as sufficient to any day thereof." <br><br>

      Across half a century, Langley's first act every morning is to buy the newspapers. He never throws them away. <br><br><P style="MARGIN: 0px 20px">
Langley's project consisted of counting and filing news stories according to category: invasions, wars, mass murders, auto, train, and plane wrecks, love scandals, church scandals, robberies, murders, lynchings, rapes, political misdoings with a subhead of crooked elections, police misdeeds, gangland rubouts, investment scams, strikes, tenement fires, trials civil, trials criminal, and so on. 

<P style="MARGIN: 0px"><br>
      Eventually, "he would have enough statistical evidence to narrow his findings to the kinds of events that were, by their frequency, seminal human behavior."  And goes on: "He wanted to fix American life finally in one edition, what he called Collyer's eternally current dateless newspaper, the only newspaper anyone would ever need." <br><br>

       (In a 1977 panel at Harvard, Doctorow said: "If I could get Punch Sulzberger to agree to issue the paper as written in its entirety by me, on just one day, I would spend many, many years preparing that particular city edition. And I would consider it -- it would be my life's work." The roads to art are often long and surprising.) <br><br>

      In the final 40 pages of this novel, Doctorow makes another great leap of the imagination. The Collyer brothers don't die in 1947. They live on, through the 1960s and after, trying to make sense of the violent and unjust world and their own lives. Homer goes deaf. He huddles in the labyrinth of the packed house, hungry, inert, with "only the touch of my brother's hand to know that I am not alone." In this lean, deep novel about time, memory, and love, neither is the reader. --<i>Pete Hamill</i><br><br>

</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Michael Dirda</h3><p>&#8230;as with his much admired novels <i>The Book of Daniel, Ragtime, Billy Bathgate</i> and <i>The March,</i> Doctorow again creatively reconfigures and amplifies the historical record&#8230;There's a briskness to <i>Homer & Langley</i> that never flags, and its solitary protagonists&#151;two lost souls&#151;possess a half-comical, half-nightmarish fascination. They seem, at once, symbols of both American materialism and of American loneliness. Think of Melville's "isolatoes," or of all those forlorn men in shirt sleeves and the dispirited women of Edward Hopper's paintings, or of Hank Williams singing "I'm so lonesome I could cry."</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Liesl Schillinger</h3><p>When Homer, in a bid for empathy, asks, "What could be more terrible than being turned into a mythic joke?" readers caught up in Doctorow's tender, lushly drawn narrative may feel a pang, remembering Langley's Theory of Replacements and wondering what slot history has in store for them. Yet after the novel's spell ebbs, they will probably, guiltily, revert to the more instinctive response to Homer's plea. What's worse than being turned into a joke? Dying in your house buried under 100 tons of trash. The achievement of Doctorow's masterly, compassionate double portrait is that it succeeds for 200 pages in suspending the snigger, elevating the Collyers beyond caricature and turning them into creatures of their times instead of figures of fun.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Doctorow, whose literary trophy shelf has got to be overflowing by now, delivers a small but sweeping masterpiece about the infamous New York hermits, the Collyer brothers. When WWI hits and the Spanish flu pandemic kills Homer and Langley's parents, Langley, the elder, goes to war, with his Columbia education and his "godlike immunity to such an ordinary fate as death in a war." Homer, alone and going blind, faces a world "considerably dimmed" though "more deliciously felt" by his other senses. When Langley returns, real darkness descends on the eccentric orphans&#58; inside their shuttered Fifth Avenue mansion, Langley hoards newspaper clippings and starts innumerable science projects, each eventually abandoned, though he continues to imagine them in increasingly bizarre ways, which he then recites to Homer. Occasionally, outsiders wander through the house, exposing it as a living museum of artifacts, Americana, obscurity and simmering madness. Doctorow's achievement is in not undermining the dignity of two brothers who share a lush landscape built on imagination and incapacities. It's a feat of distillation, vision and sympathy. <I>(Sept.)</I></P>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>A young man leading a privileged life in early 1900s New York goes blind. His brother goes to war and returns home a different person, reckless yet reclusive after being gassed. Their parents, never a strong presence in their lives, languish and die, and so Homer and Langley are left on their own in a Fifth Avenue apartment that slowly decays as Langley stacks it with all manner of rubbish he lovingly collects. Langley has mad schemes&mdash;he wants to publish a newspaper that needs only one issue, encapsulating all that's worth knowing&mdash;but he sees with stark clarity what's wrong with the world. Homer, a sensitive pianist, sticks with Langley. Together, through Homer's failed liaison with a housemaid, the death of longtime servants, and the internment of their Japanese housekeepers during World War II, the brothers age, their lives summing up a fading 20th-century America. This novel defines quiet desperation, captured with such precision by the unerring Doctorow that it can be a dispiriting read&mdash;as, one thinks, the author intended. The ending is wrenchingly poignant. VERDICT Doctorow in a minor key but as accomplished as ever. [See Prepub Alert, LJ 5/1/09.]&mdash;Barbara Hoffert, Library Journal
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Brothers live together in a decaying New York City mansion as history marches on in the latest from Doctorow (The March, 2005, etc.). Brothers Homer and Langley share a moneyed childhood in relative bliss, although narrator Homer is slowly going blind. Then both Homer's parents succumb to the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918, shortly before older brother Langley returns from service in World War I damaged by mustard gas. Increasingly eccentric (or deranged), Langley devotes his life to organizing articles from the newspapers he collects and never throws away. Homer's musical ambitions never come to much. Nor do his romantic affairs. Langley's one marriage is a disaster. But the brothers' lives touch on history, or its surface accoutrements, with a vengeance. Homer plays accompaniment for silent movies. Langley drives a Model T into the dining room. In the '20s they frequent speakeasies, where they meet a stereotypical gangster playboy who by the '50s has become more of a stereotypical Mafioso. Their African-American cook has a New Orleans jazz musician grandson. During the Depression the brothers throw "tea dances" to make extra money. The FBI whisk away a nice Japanese couple in the brothers' employ to a World War II internment camp. By the '50s Langley has acquired a television and a typewriter collection. By the '60s the brothers are taking in hippies as well as feral cats. Later Homer is dismayed to discover the young girl he once mentored as a musician and secretly loved has become an activist nun murdered in South America. As the brothers' funds shrink and the Fifth Avenue mansion they inherited falls into decay, the parallel to Gray Gardens comes to mind, particularly since an agingHomer types his memories on a Braille typewriter for a French journalist named Jacqueline. Usually a master at incorporating history into rich fiction, Doctorow offers few insights here and a narrator/hero who is never more than a cipher.

<a name="EXC"></a><h3>Read an Excerpt</h3><P>I&#8217;m Homer, the blind brother, I didn't lose my sight all at once, it was like the movies, a slow fade-out. When I was told what was happening I was interested to measure it, I was in my late teens then, keen on everything. What I did this particular winter was to stand back from the lake in Central Park where they did all their ice skating and see what I could see and couldn&#8217;t see as a day-by-day thing. The houses over to Central Park West went first, they got darker as if dissolving into the dark sky until I couldn&#8217;t make them out, and then the trees began to lose their shape, and then finally, this was toward the end of the season, maybe it was late February of that very cold winter, and all I could see were these phantom shapes of the ice skaters floating past me on a field of ice, and then the white ice, that last light, went gray and then altogether black, and then all my sight was gone though I could hear clearly the scoot scut of the blades on the ice, a very satisfying sound, a soft sound though full of intention, a deeper tone than you&#8217;d expect made by the skate blades, perhaps for having sounded the resonant basso of the water under the ice, scoot scut, scoot scut. I would hear someone going someplace fast, and then the twirl into that long scurratch as the skater spun to a stop, and then I laughed too for the joy of that ability of the skater to come to a dead stop all at once, going along scoot scut and then scurratch.<br><br>Of course I was sad too, but it was lucky this happened to me when I was so young with no idea of being disabled, moving on in my mind to my other capacities like my exceptional hearing, which I trained to a degree ofalertness that was almost visual. Langley said I had ears like a bat and he tested that proposition, as he liked to subject everything to review. I was of course familiar with our house, all four storeys of it, and could navigate every room and up and down the stairs without hesitation, knowing where everything was by memory. I knew the drawing room, our father&#8217;s study, our mother&#8217;s sitting room, the dining room with its eighteen chairs and the walnut long table, the butler&#8217;s pantry and the kitchens, the parlor, the bedrooms, I remembered how many of the carpeted steps there were between the floors, I didn&#8217;t even have to hold on to the railing, you could watch me and if you didn&#8217;t know me you wouldn&#8217;t know my eyes were dead. But Langley said the true test of my hearing capacity would come when no memory was involved, so he shifted things around a bit, taking me into the music room, where he had earlier rolled the grand piano around to a different corner and had put the Japanese folding screen with the herons in water in the middle of the room, and for good measure twirled me around in the doorway till my entire sense of direction was obliterated, and I had to laugh because don&#8217;t you know I walked right around that folding screen and sat down at the piano exactly as if I knew where he had put it, as I did, I could hear surfaces, and I said to Langley, A blind bat whistles, that&#8217;s the way he does it, but I didn&#8217;t have to whistle, did I? He was truly amazed, Langley is the older of us by two years, and I have always liked to impress him in whatever way I could. At this time he was already a college student in his first year at Columbia. How do you do it? he said. This is of scientific interest. I said: I feel shapes as they push the air away, or I feel heat from things, you can turn me around till I&#8217;m dizzy, but I can still tell where the air is filled in with something solid.<br><br>And there were other compensations as well. I had tutors for my education and then, of course, I was comfortably enrolled in the West End Conservatory of Music, where I had been a student since my sighted years. My skill as a pianist rendered my blindness acceptable in the social world. As I grew older, people spoke of my gallantry, and the girls certainly liked me. In our New York society of those days, one parental means of ensuring a daughter&#8217;s marriage to a suitable husband was to warn her, from birth it seemed, to watch out for men and to not quite trust them. This was well before the Great War, when the days of the flapper and women smoking cigarettes and drinking martinis were in the unimaginable future. So a handsome young blind man of reputable family was particularly attractive insofar as he could not, even in secret, do anything untoward. His helplessness was very alluring to a woman trained since birth, herself, to be helpless. It made her feel strong, in command, it could bring out her sense of pity, it could do lots of things, my sightlessness. She could express herself, give herself to her pent-up feelings, as she could not safely do with a normal fellow. I dressed very well, I could shave myself with my straight razor and never nick the skin, and at my instructions the barber kept my hair a bit longer than it was being worn in that day, so that when at some gathering I sat at the piano and played the Appassionata, for instance, or the Revolutionary &#201;tude, my hair would fly about&#8212;I had a lot of it then, a good thick mop of brown hair parted in the middle and coming down each side of my head. Franz Lisztian hair is what it was. And if we were sitting on a sofa and no one was about, a young lady friend might kiss me, touch my face and kiss me, and I, being blind, could put my hand on her thigh without seeming to have that intention, and so she might gasp, but would leave it there for fear of embarrassing me.<br><br>I should say that as a man who never married I have been particularly sensitive to women, very appreciative in fact, and let me admit right off that I had a sexual experience or two in this time I am describing, this time of my blind city life as a handsome young fellow not yet twenty, when our parents were still alive and had many soirees, and entertained the very best people of the city in our home, a monumental tribute to late Victorian design that would be bypassed by modernity&#8212;as for instance the interior fashions of our family friend Elsie de Wolfe, who, after my father wouldn&#8217;t allow her to revamp the entire place, never again set foot in our manse&#8212;and which I always found comfortable, solid, dependable, with its big upholstered pieces, or tufted Empire side chairs, or heavy drapes over the curtains on the ceiling-to-floor windows, or medieval tapestries hung from gilt poles, and bow-windowed bookcases, thick Persian rugs, and standing lamps with tasseled shades and matching chinois amphora that you could almost step into&#8230;it was all very eclectic, being a record of sorts of our parents&#8217; travels, and cluttered it might have seemed to outsiders, but it seemed normal and right to us and it was our legacy, Langley&#8217;s and mine, this sense of living with things assertively inanimate, and having to walk around them.<br><br>Our parents went abroad for a month every year, sailing away on one ocean liner or another, waving from the railing of some great three- or four-stacker&#8212;the Carmania, the Mauretania, the Neuresthania&#8212;as she pulled away from the dock. They looked so small up there, as small as I felt with my hand in the tight hand of my nurse, and the ship&#8217;s horn sounding in my feet and the gulls flying about as if in celebration, as if something really fine was going on. I used to wonder what would happen to my father&#8217;s patients while he was away, for he was a prominent women&#8217;s doctor and I worried that they would get sick and maybe die, waiting for him to return.<br><br>Even as my parents were running around England, or Italy, or Greece or Egypt, or wherever they were, their return was presaged by things in crates delivered to the back door by the Railway Express Company: ancient Islamic tiles, or rare books, or a marble water fountain, or busts of Romans with no noses or missing ears, or antique armoires with their fecal smell.<br><br>And then, finally, with great huzzahs, there, after I&#8217;d almost forgotten all about them, would be Mother and Father themselves stepping out of the cab in front of our house, and carrying in their arms such treasures as hadn&#8217;t preceded them. They were not entirely thoughtless parents for there were always presents for Langley and me, things to really excite a boy, like an antique toy train that was too delicate to play with, or a gold-plated hairbrush.<br><br>we did some traveling as well, my brother and I, being habitual summer campers in our youth. Our camp was in Maine on a coastal plateau of woods and fields, a good place to appreciate Nature. The more our country lay under blankets of factory smoke, the more the coal came rattling up from the mines, the more our massive locomotives thundered through the night and big harvesting machines sliced their way through the crops and black cars filled the streets, blowing their horns and crashing into one another, the more the American people worshipped Nature. Most often this devotion was relegated to the children. So there we were living in primitive cabins in Maine, boys and girls in adjoining camps.<br><br>I was in the fullness of my senses, then. My legs were limber and my arms strong and sinewy and I could see the world with all the unconscious happiness of a fourteen-year-old. Not far from the camps, on a bluff overlooking the ocean, was a meadow profuse with wild blackberry bushes, and one afternoon numbers of us were there plucking the ripe blackberries and biting into their wet warm pericarped pulp, competing with flights of bumblebees, as we raced them from one bush to another and stuffed the berries into our mouths till the juice dripped down our chins. The air was thickened with floating communities of gnats that rose and fell, expanding and contracting, like astronomical events.

When I was told what was happening I was interested to measure it, I was in my late teens then, keen on everything. What I did this particular winter was to stand back from the lake in Central Park where they did all their ice skating and see what I could see and couldn&#8217;t see as a day-by-day thing. The houses over to Central Park West went first, they got darker as if dissolving into the dark sky until I couldn&#8217;t make them out, and then the trees began to lose their shape, and then finally, this was toward the end of the season, maybe it was late February of that very cold winter, and all I could see were these phantom shapes of the ice skaters floating past me on a field of ice, and then the white ice, that last light, went gray and then altogether black, and then all my sight was gone though I could hear clearly the scoot scut of the blades on the ice, a very satisfying sound, a soft sound though full of intention, a deeper tone than you&#8217;d expect made by the skate blades, perhaps for having sounded the resonant basso of the water under the ice, scoot scut, scoot scut. I would hear someone going someplace fast, and then the twirl into that long scurratch as the skater spun to a stop, andthen I laughed too for the joy of that ability of the skater to come to a dead stop all at once, going along scoot scut and then scurratch.<br><br>Of course I was sad too, but it was lucky this happened to me when I was so young with no idea of being disabled, moving on in my mind to my other capacities like my exceptional hearing, which I trained to a degree of alertness that was almost visual. Langley said I had ears like a bat and he tested that proposition, as he liked to subject everything to review. I was of course familiar with our house, all four storeys of it, and could navigate every room and up and down the stairs without hesitation, knowing where everything was by memory. I knew the drawing room, our father&#8217;s study, our mother&#8217;s sitting room, the dining room with its eighteen chairs and the walnut long table, the butler&#8217;s pantry and the kitchens, the parlor, the bedrooms, I remembered how many of the carpeted steps there were between the floors, I didn&#8217;t even have to hold on to the railing, you could watch me and if you didn&#8217;t know me you wouldn&#8217;t know my eyes were dead. But Langley said the true test of my hearing capacity would come when no memory was involved, so he shifted things around a bit, taking me into the music room, where he had earlier rolled the grand piano around to a different corner and had put the Japanese folding screen with the herons in water in the middle of the room, and for good measure twirled me around in the doorway till my entire sense of direction was obliterated, and I had to laugh because don&#8217;t you know I walked right around that folding screen and sat down at the piano exactly as if I knew where he had put it, as I did, I could hear surfaces, and I said to Langley, A blind bat whistles, that&#8217;s the way he does it, but I didn&#8217;t have to whistle, did I? He was truly amazed, Langley is the older of us by two years, and I have always liked to impress him in whatever way I could. At this time he was already a college student in his first year at Columbia. How do you do it? he said. This is of scientific interest. I said&#58; I feel shapes as they push the air away, or I feel heat from things, you can turn me around till I&#8217;m dizzy, but I can still tell where the air is filled in with something solid.<br><br>And there were other compensations as well. I had tutors for my education and then, of course, I was comfortably enrolled in the West End Conservatory of Music, where I had been a student since my sighted years. My skill as a pianist rendered my blindness acceptable in the social world. As I grew older, people spoke of my gallantry, and the girls certainly liked me. In our New York society of those days, one parental means of ensuring a daughter&#8217;s marriage to a suitable husband was to warn her, from birth it seemed, to watch out for men and to not quite trust them. This was well before the Great War, when the days of the flapper and women smoking cigarettes and drinking martinis were in the unimaginable future. So a handsome young blind man of reputable family was particularly attractive insofar as he could not, even in secret, do anything untoward. His helplessness was very alluring to a woman trained since birth, herself, to be helpless. It made her feel strong, in command, it could bring out her sense of pity, it could do lots of things, my sightlessness. She could express herself, give herself to her pent-up feelings, as she could not safely do with a normal fellow. I dressed very well, I could shave myself with my straight razor and never nick the skin, and at my instructions the barber kept my hair a bit longer than it was being worn in that day, so that when at some gathering I sat at the piano and played the Appassionata, for instance, or the Revolutionary &#201;tude, my hair would fly about&#8212;I had a lot of it then, a good thick mop of brown hair parted in the middle and coming down each side of my head. Franz Lisztian hair is what it was. And if we were sitting on a sofa and no one was about, a young lady friend might kiss me, touch my face and kiss me, and I, being blind, could put my hand on her thigh without seeming to have that intention, and so she might gasp, but would leave it there for fear of embarrassing me.<br><br>I should say that as a man who never married I have been particularly sensitive to women, very appreciative in fact, and let me admit right off that I had a sexual experience or two in this time I am describing, this time of my blind city life as a handsome young fellow not yet twenty, when our parents were still alive and had many soirees, and entertained the very best people of the city in our home, a monumental tribute to late Victorian design that would be bypassed by modernity&#8212;as for instance the interior fashions of our family friend Elsie de Wolfe, who, after my father wouldn&#8217;t allow her to revamp the entire place, never again set foot in our manse&#8212;and which I always found comfortable, solid, dependable, with its big upholstered pieces, or tufted Empire side chairs, or heavy drapes over the curtains on the ceiling-to-floor windows, or medieval tapestries hung from gilt poles, and bow-windowed bookcases, thick Persian rugs, and standing lamps with tasseled shades and matching chinois amphora that you could almost step into?.?.?.?it was all very eclectic, being a record of sorts of our parents&#8217; travels, and cluttered it might have seemed to outsiders, but it seemed normal and right to us and it was our legacy, Langley&#8217;s and mine, this sense of living with things assertively inanimate, and having to walk around them.<br><br>Our parents went abroad for a month every year, sailing away on one ocean liner or another, waving from the railing of some great three- or four-stacker&#8212;the Carmania? the Mauretania? the Neuresthania?&#8212;as she pulled away from the dock. They looked so small up there, as small as I felt with my hand in the tight hand of my nurse, and the ship&#8217;s horn sounding in my feet and the gulls flying about as if in celebration, as if something really fine was going on. I used to wonder what would happen to my father&#8217;s patients while he was away, for he was a prominent women&#8217;s doctor and I worried that they would get sick and maybe die, waiting for him to return.<br><br>Even as my parents were running around England, or Italy, or Greece or Egypt, or wherever they were, their return was presaged by things in crates delivered to the back door by the Railway Express Company&#58; ancient Islamic tiles, or rare books, or a marble water fountain, or busts of Romans with no noses or missing ears, or antique armoires with their fecal smell.<br><br>And then, finally, with great huzzahs, there, after I&#8217;d almost forgotten all about them, would be Mother and Father themselves stepping out of the cab in front of our house, and carrying in their arms such treasures as hadn&#8217;t preceded them. They were not entirely thoughtless parents for there were always presents for Langley and me, things to really excite a boy, like an antique toy train that was too delicate to play with, or a gold-plated hairbrush.<br><br>we did some traveling as well, my brother and I, being habitual summer campers in our youth. Our camp was in Maine on a coastal plateau of woods and fields, a good place to appreciate Nature. The more our country lay under blankets of factory smoke, the more the coal came rattling up from the mines, the more our massive locomotives thundered through the night and big harvesting machines sliced their way through the crops and black cars filled the streets, blowing their horns and crashing into one another, the more the American people worshipped Nature. Most often this devotion was relegated to the children. So there we were living in primitive cabins in Maine, boys and girls in adjoining camps.<br><br>I was in the fullness of my senses, then. My legs were limber and my arms strong and sinewy and I could see the world with all the unconscious happiness of a fourteen-year-old. Not far from the camps, on a bluff overlooking the ocean, was a meadow profuse with wild blackberry bushes, and one afternoon numbers of us were there plucking the ripe blackberries and biting into their wet warm pericarped pulp, competing with flights of bumblebees, as we raced them from one bush to another and stuffed the berries into our mouths till the juice dripped down our chins. The air was thickened with floating communities of gnats that rose and fell, expanding and contracting, like astronomical events. And the sun shone on our heads, and behind us at the foot of the cliff were the black and silver rocks patiently taking and breaking apart the waves and, beyond that, the glittering sea radiant with shards of sun, and all of it in my clear eyes as I turned in triumph to this one girl with whom I had bonded, Eleanor was her name, and stretched my arms wide and bowed as the magician who had made it for her. And somehow when the others moved on we lingered conspiratorially behind a thicket of blackberry bushes until the sound of them was gone and we were there unattended, having broken camp rules, and so self-defined as more grown-up than anyone believed, though we grew reflective walking back, holding hands without even realizing it.<br><br>Is there any love purer than this, when you don&#8217;t even know what it is?
