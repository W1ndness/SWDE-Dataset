In these pages you&#8217;ll also meet Maya and Zuni, two orphaned baby hummingbirds who hatched from eggs the size of navy beans, and who are little more than air bubbles fringed with feathers. Their lives hang precariously in the balance&#8212;but with human help, they may one day conquer the sky. <P>Snowball is a cockatoo whose dance video went viral on YouTube and who&#8217;s now teaching schoolchildren how to dance. You&#8217;ll meet Harris&#8217;s hawks named Fire and Smoke. And you&#8217;ll come to know and love a host of other avian characters who will change your mind forever about who birds really are. <P>Each of these birds shows a different and utterly surprising aspect of what makes a bird a bird&#8212;and these are the lessons of <i>Birdology</i>&#58; that birds are far stranger, more wondrous, and at the same time more like us than we might have dared to imagine. In <i>Birdology, </i>beloved author of <i>The Good Good Pig </i>Sy Montgomery explores the essence of the otherworldly creatures we see every day. By way of her adventures with seven birds&#8212;wild, tame, exotic, and common&#8212;she weaves new scientific insights and narrative to reveal seven kernels of bird wisdom. <P>The first lesson of <i>Birdology </i>is that, no matter how common they are, Birds Are Individuals, as each of Montgomery&#8217;s distinctive Ladies clearly shows. In the leech-infested rain forest of Queensland, you&#8217;ll come face to face with a cassowary&#8212;a 150-pound,man-tall, flightless bird with a helmet of bone on its head and a slashing razor-like toenail with which it (occasionally) eviscerates people&#8212;proof that Birds Are Dinosaurs. You&#8217;ll learn from hawks that Birds Are Fierce; from pigeons, how Birds Find Their Way Home; from parrots, what it means that Birds Can Talk; and from 50,000 crows who moved into a small city&#8217;s downtown, that Birds Are Everywhere. They are the winged aliens who surround us. <P><i><P>Birdology </i>explains just how very "other" birds are&#58; Their hearts look like those of crocodiles. They are covered with modified scales, which are called feathers. Their bones are hollow. Their bodies are permeated with extensive air sacs. They have no hands. They give birth to eggs. Yet despite birds&#8217; and humans&#8217; disparate evolutionary paths, we share emotional and intellectual abilities that allow us to communicate and even form deep bonds. When we begin to comprehend who birds really are, we deepen our capacity to approach, understand, and love these otherworldly creatures. And this, ultimately, is the priceless lesson of <i>Birdology</i>&#58; it communicates a heartfelt fascination and awe for birds and restores our connection to these complex, mysterious fellow creatures.
</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												David Gessner</h3><p>The author's heart might sometimes sing a little too much for my taste, and the prose is more often informative than transformative, but the book caught me by surprise, giving me a peek into feathered worlds. Like many recent books, including those by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas and Jeffrey Masson, <i>Birdology</i> strives to correct the dated but still-recent scientific assessment of animals in general, and birds in particular, as unfeeling automatons. Luckily, science has almost caught up to what every pet owner knows, and Montgomery avails herself of new findings as she brings to life parrots that converse rather than merely "parrot," crows that use tools and pigeons that navigate by making use of everything from Earth's magnetism to smell.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>Known for her books that illuminate the wonders of nature for both children and adults, Sy Montgomery "is a modern miracle," says <I>Book</I> magazine, "bawdy, brave, inventive, prophetic, hellbent on loving this planet."</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><div id="flashcontent"></div><SCRIPT language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://natalie.feedroom.com/fr_embed.js"></SCRIPT><SCRIPT type="text/javascript">

											Sy Montgomery has a real knack for writing the kind of non-fiction books I love to read. They are always packed with interesting, little-known facts, lovely people, and the adventures Sy always seems to have whenever she is researching a book. Birdology does not disappoint! Each chapter is about a different species of bird that illustrates and essential characteristic of the species. Along the way I meet pigeon racers, falconers, and wildlife rehabilitators. I fell in love with the birds - the Ladies, Sy's pack of hens, Maya and Zuni, two baby hummingbirds, Snowball, the dancing cockatoo, and so many others. The personal stories and vignettes were so entertaining and skillfully written that I was almost to the end of the book before the hidden agenda was revealed. As the last sentence of the book reads, &quot;It is our duty and privilege to protect them.&quot; Beatifully written, easy to read and entertaining, educational. and with an important message - I'm not sure how Sy Montgomery packed so many things into this book, but it is well worth the read!</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Birdology is a wonderful book!

											I have read all of author/naturalist Sy Montgomery's books. In Birdology, Montgomery manages again to do what she does so well: to blend extensive information about animals with enormous empathy for them, with unusual insights into their lives derived from her personal experiences with diverse creatures. Birdology looks at the lives and abilities and evolution of birds from this unique perspective, using several particular species as exemplars. Along the way one also learns about her adventures while exploring the avian world. This is a wonderfully engaging book; I enjoyed it very much, and highly recommend it to all!</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35703708.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Sy Montgomery</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Hancock, New Hampshire</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>February 07, 1958</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Frankfurt, Germany</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Syracuse University: B.A., Newhouse School of Public Communications, 1979; B.A., College of Arts and Sciences, 1979</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>In our exclusive interview with Montgomery, she revealed a few fun anecdotes:</I> <p>    <b>"My companion pig, Christopher Hogwood,</b> age 12, lost 60 pounds on his new diet and now weighs in at a trim 690 pounds." <p>    <b>"My first known act of Eco-Conscience:</b> I was sent home from kindergarten for biting a little boy who had pulled the legs off a daddy longlegs.

You will not find Henry Beston's 1928 classic in the "Spirituality" section of your bookstore. It is a chronicle of the naturalist's solitary year on a Cape Cod beach, observing the migrations of the alewives, listening to the music of the waves, feeling the hot sun on the dunes and smelling the keen, vivid reek of hot salt grass. It is a book about least terns nesting on the open beach; the flattened sharks called skates that sometimes wash up in the shallows; the character and poetry of September light on sand; and winter surf and shipwrecks. <p>    But it is also a book of worship, one that helped me to define the prayer that is my life's work chronicling the natural world. It is a book that today continues to shape an emerging American consciousness of a spiritual connection to the land. It is a book that helps redefine spirituality itself. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  These are listed in the order in which I read them, and exclude the books of the Bible: <p>    <li><I>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</I> by Lewis Carroll, which was read me by my father, and which I still enjoy reading today for its magic, humor, and poetry. <p>    <li><I>Charlotte's Web</I> by E. B. White -- the greatest PR agent spiders could ever hope for. The book is very accurate on pigs, too. <p>    <li><I>Never Cry Wolf</I> by Farley Mowat -- At times hilarious and horrifying, and a blueprint for how compassionate science can be applied to save population and species. As a young reader, this was one of my favorite books, and among the most inspiring. It turns out I met Farley Mowat many years later, and he speaks and thinks just like he writes -- he is a very generous, brave, larger-than-life soul. <p>    <li><I>The Outermost House</I> by Henry Beston -- see above. <p>    <li><I>Under Milk Wood</I> by Dylan Thomas -- The most lyrical book I have ever read. <p>    <li><I>Biophilia</I> by E. O. Wilson -- Written by my biggest hero, who turns out to be both a true gentleman and a scholar, about why we yearn in our very genes for connection with the natural world. <p>    <li><I>Reindeer Moon</I> by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, which tells us, though fiction, who we, <I>Homo sapiens,</I> really are. <p>    <li><I>Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice</I> by Mark Plotkin -- A vivid and heartfelt true adventure, full of humor and discovery, written by a superb scientist who cares deeply about Amazonian cultures. <p>    <li><I>The Same Ax, Twice</I> by Howard Mansfield -- see below. <p>    <li><I>Into the Tangle of Friendship</I> by Beth Kephart -- see below.  <p>    <b>Favorite music?</b><br>  <li>Medieval Advent Procession music  <li>Bruce Springsteen  <li>Pachelbel's Canon  <li>The Methodist Hymnal   <p>    <b>Favorite film?</b><br>  <I>Fitzgeraldo</I> -- a film about an opera lover who yearns to build an opera house in Iquitos, Peru. Researching <I>Journey of the Pink Dolphins</I>, I have spent time in Iquitos and watched the first opera to be performed in 90 years at the stunningly beautiful Theatre Amazonas, the opera house 1,000 miles up the Amazon in Manaus, Brazil. The film is very evocative and also is to be recommended because it has a sloth in it, which far too few films do. <p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading, and why?</b><br>    I would pick three books that invite readers to join the effort to mend the world: <p>    <li><I>The Same Ax, Twice: Restoration and Renewal in a Throw-Away Age</I> by Howard Mansfield. This book examines the impulse to restore, to mend, to renew, at a time when it seems our economy is based on the McDonald's-ization of the nation. No other author has realized that the same spirit animates those who preserve old houses, who work to save endangered species, who restore antique engines, who attend re-enactments of the Civil War, and who donate to The Nature Conservancy. All of us are trying to mend the world. This beautiful book shows us a plethora of ways both how and why, and introduces us to what the author calls "an arkload of Noahs" who are accomplishing the sacred work of putting the world back together again. <p>    <li><I>Sightings</I> by Brenda Peterson and Linda Hogan. This vivid, passionate, impressionistic homage and portrait of the gray whale cannot but turn readers into conservationists for this magnificent, wise, and loving creature. It's a fast read suited to book clubs and would be wisely paired with the vastly longer but rewardingly rich <I>Eye of the Whale</I> by Dick Russell. <p>    <li><I>The Killers Within: The Deadly Rise of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</I> by Mark Plotkin and Michael Shnayerson. A riveting book that details a terrifying danger born of corporate ruthlessness. The alarming misuse of antibiotics will only grow worse unless we do something about it. <p>    <b>Who are your favorite writers, and what makes their writing special?</b><br>    My favorite living writers are:<p>    <li>Howard Mansfield, who writes on American life in a wholly original way -- examining in his books who we choose to honor as our ancestors, how we mark and demarcate the land, what we choose to preserve. In his <I>In the Memory House</I>, for instance, he examines small local-history museums, figures such as Johnny Appleseed and Jack Kerouac, absences in our American landscape. In all of his excellent books (<I>Cosmopolis: Yesterday's Cities of the Future; In the Memory House; Skylark: The Life, Lies and Inventions of Harry Atwood;</I> and <I>The Same Ax, Twice</I>) he dares to look at what we have lost, what we have created, and the forces that are still sculpting the American landscape. <p>     <li>Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, whose penetrating and astute observations of the Bushmen of the Kalahari in the 1950s inform her ways of understanding both people and other animals, and animate both her fiction and nonfiction. After her bestselling <I>The Harmless People</I> chronicled her family's historic expeditions into Bushmanland, <I>Warrior-Herdsmen</I> took her (and her own family, including two small children) to Uganda (as Idi Amin rose to power) to present her extraordinary, clear-eyed portrait of the brave and stoic Dodoth. Her imaginings of Paleolithic people in <I>Reindeer Moon</I> and <I>The Animal Wife</I> are unmatched in detail and lyricism. She brings the same dignity, logic, and sweeping brilliance to her writings about animals, including <I>The Hidden Life of Dogs</I>, <I>The Tribe of Tiger</I>, and <I>Certain Poor Shepherds</I>. <p>     <li>Beth Kephart, whose first book (<I>A Slant of Sun</I>) was a finalist for the National Book Award, writes with an intoxicating poetry that penetrates the heart. Even when writing about exotic locales (such as her husband's home on a coffee plantation in El Salvador in <I>Still Love</I>) she addresses universal themes -- friendship, marriage, motherhood -- that resonate to the core of every reader who has ever loved. Her luminous prose is worthy of her subjects, as is her considerable intellect. <p>     <b>What are your favorite books to give as gifts?</b><br>  <li><I>Certain Poor Shepherds</I> by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas -- a modern Christmas classic for all ages. <p>  <li><I>The Same Ax, Twice: Restoration and Renewal in a Throw-Away Age</I> by Howard Mansfield -- a wonderful way to start the new year. <p>  <li><I>Into the Tangle of Friendship</i> by Beth Kepart -- a perfect gift for every friend.<p>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>  <I>In the summer of 2004, we asked authors featured in Meet the Writers to give us a list of their all-time favorite summer reads, and tell us what makes them just right for the season. Here's what Sy Montgomery had to say: </I><p>    These classics always deepen the joy of revisiting my favorite watery summer habitats: <p>  <li><I>The Edge of the Sea</I> by Rachael Carson -- The author of <I>Silent Spring</I>, a marine biologist, loved first and foremost the sea --its shores, its tidepools, its reefs. In passionate and eloquent expositions, she leads us to these magical places anew, portraying each as "a world that keeps alive the sense of continuing creation and of the relentless drive of life."<p>    <li><I>Pagoo</I> by Holling Clancy Holling -- Pagoo, a hermit crab, has been introducing children to tidepool life since this beautifully illustrated, fact-filled little book debuted in 1957. Full of sophisticated and accurate natural history information, it's a joy to read at any age.<p>    <li><I>The Herring Gull's World</i> by Niko Tinbergen -- Written by one of the foremost naturalists of the 20th century, this is a classic study of the quintessential "sea gull" written with humor, drama and respect for his subjects.<p>  <li><I>Waiting for Aphrodite</I> by Sue Hubbel -- Via the tide pools and ocean waters in her new hometown in rural Maine, a masterful natural history writer takes us on "Journeys into the Time before Bones."<p>  <li><I>Eye of the Whale</I> by Dick Russell -- Carrying the summer reader even further out to sea, this thick, rich book tracks the California Gray Whale through time, through human history, and along its astonishing migration from the lagoons of Baja, California to the Bering Strait.<p>  <li><I>Dragonflies and Damselflies of Cape Cod</I> by Virginia Carpenter -- Even New Englanders far from the Cape will find this field guide more useful than larger ones, because it contains the species you're most likely to see, and isn't jammed with the hundreds you won't. The slim, light paperback fits easily into a backpack on the way to the pond. <p>    <li><I>The Field Book of Ponds and Streams</I> by Ann Haven Morgan -- This 1930 volume is still my favorite field guide to the mysterious and dramatic world of predaceous diving beetles, net-spinning caddis worms, and the strange, teeming life on the underside of lily pads.<p>    Two brand-new water books join my list of all-time favorite summer reading:<p>    <li><I>Animal Heart</I>by Brenda Peterson -- Set largely underwater, this is a spellbinding tale about people and dolphins, illness and love, activism and adventure. Forensic divers discover the hideous truth behind the Navy's experiments with ultra-loud underwater sound weapons. Riveting fiction -- yet all too true. <p>    <li><I>Self-Portrait with Turtles</I> by David Carroll -- One of the deepest delights of my summer is its turtles -- the big, mossy-headed snapper I see sometimes out at the rock at Willard Pond, the smooth-shelled Eastern Painted Turtles sunning themselves on the log across the bog. Luminous with the honey-gold summer light of sun on water, sweet-scented with fern and flower, this book is brimful of turtles -- and from the first spotted turtle Carroll met when he was eight, they transform and animate the author's wise and joyful life. <p>    And finally, a relatively new book (1993) honors the ubiquitous summertime sport:<p>  <li><I>The New Face of Baseball</I> by Tim Wendel -- The inspirational and intriguing story of how Latino athletes are transforming and enriching America's national sport.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p><P>Combining both a trained naturalist's observations and a natural storyteller's talents, Sy Montgomery's Birdology takes you inside the world of the winged aliens that most of us think about when they cluster around our bird feeders. As the subtitle suggests, this book is much more than a dry taxonomy; Montgomery views our fine feathered friends as fellow evolving inhabitants of our wondrous world. (Hand-selling tip&#58; The sections on pigeon intelligence and falcon hunting are worth the price of the book.)</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>Meet the ladies&#58; a flock of smart, affectionate, highly individualistic chickens who visit their favorite neighbors, devise different ways to hide from foxes, and mob the author like she&#8217;s a rock star. In these pages you&#8217;ll also meet Maya and Zuni, two orphaned baby hummingbirds who hatched from eggs the size of navy beans, and who are little more than air bubbles fringed with feathers. Their lives hang precariously in the balance&#8212;but with human help, they may one day conquer the sky. <P>Snowball is a cockatoo whose dance video went viral on YouTube and who&#8217;s now teaching schoolchildren how to dance. You&#8217;ll meet Harris&#8217;s hawks named Fire and Smoke. And you&#8217;ll come to know and love a host of other avian characters who will change your mind forever about who birds really are. <P>Each of these birds shows a different and utterly surprising aspect of what makes a bird a bird&#8212;and these are the lessons of <i>Birdology</i>&#58; that birds are far stranger, more wondrous, and at the same time more like us than we might have dared to imagine. In <i>Birdology, </i>beloved author of <i>The Good Good Pig </i>Sy Montgomery explores the essence of the otherworldly creatures we see every day. By way of her adventures with seven birds&#8212;wild, tame, exotic, and common&#8212;she weaves new scientific insights and narrative to reveal seven kernels of bird wisdom. <P>The first lesson of <i>Birdology </i>is that, no matter how common they are, Birds Are Individuals, as each of Montgomery&#8217;s distinctive Ladies clearly shows. In the leech-infested rain forest of Queensland, you&#8217;ll come face to face with a cassowary&#8212;a 150-pound,man-tall, flightless bird with a helmet of bone on its head and a slashing razor-like toenail with which it (occasionally) eviscerates people&#8212;proof that Birds Are Dinosaurs. You&#8217;ll learn from hawks that Birds Are Fierce; from pigeons, how Birds Find Their Way Home; from parrots, what it means that Birds Can Talk; and from 50,000 crows who moved into a small city&#8217;s downtown, that Birds Are Everywhere. They are the winged aliens who surround us. <P><i><P>Birdology </i>explains just how very "other" birds are&#58; Their hearts look like those of crocodiles. They are covered with modified scales, which are called feathers. Their bones are hollow. Their bodies are permeated with extensive air sacs. They have no hands. They give birth to eggs. Yet despite birds&#8217; and humans&#8217; disparate evolutionary paths, we share emotional and intellectual abilities that allow us to communicate and even form deep bonds. When we begin to comprehend who birds really are, we deepen our capacity to approach, understand, and love these otherworldly creatures. And this, ultimately, is the priceless lesson of <i>Birdology</i>&#58; it communicates a heartfelt fascination and awe for birds and restores our connection to these complex, mysterious fellow creatures.
</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								David Gessner</h3><p>The author's heart might sometimes sing a little too much for my taste, and the prose is more often informative than transformative, but the book caught me by surprise, giving me a peek into feathered worlds. Like many recent books, including those by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas and Jeffrey Masson, <i>Birdology</i> strives to correct the dated but still-recent scientific assessment of animals in general, and birds in particular, as unfeeling automatons. Luckily, science has almost caught up to what every pet owner knows, and Montgomery avails herself of new findings as she brings to life parrots that converse rather than merely "parrot," crows that use tools and pigeons that navigate by making use of everything from Earth's magnetism to smell.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>Nature books can be downers, but this book is different. The people we meet&mdash;the researchers, rehabbers, enthusiasts, and fanciers with whom the author, in Plimptonesque fashion, immerses herself in order to get closer to her avian subjects&mdash;are all well-intentioned, compassionate folks. A "birdologist" seeks the divinity of creation revealed in birds, and it is this faith that drives Montgomery (The Good Good Pig) to restore her readers' "awe and connection to these winged aliens&hellip;." She writes of just seven species (ranging from the exotic New Zealand cassowary to the common crow), but her clever chapter arrangement gives a sense of their marvelous diversity. But Montgomery's impressionistic account is as much about humans as it is birds, as much about the author's own transformative experience as it is about the feathered vehicles of her change; indeed, some readers may well wish for less author and more bird. VERDICT This volume will appeal to backyard birders and animal lovers as the author has a knack for making abstruse science palatable. Hers is a poetic sensibility expressed in prose; readers looking for bird poetry may want to consider Billy Collins and David Allen Sibley's Bright Wings.&mdash;Robert Eagan, Windsor P.L., Ont.</p><br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-custreview" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="loader" id="BK_9781416569848"><img alt="loading..." title="loading..." src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/images/ajax-loader.gif"> Loading...</div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-fulldetails" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>Product Details</h3><div class="product-list-info"><div class="col-one"><ul><li class="pubDate">Pub.

Though I have written elsewhere about those emus, I never got around to a whole book about birds, mostly because mammals kept jumping the line&#58; chimps, gorillas, and orangutans. Man-eating tigers. Amazon River dolphins. Snow leopards. Tree kangaroos. Our wonderful pig, Christopher Hogwood. Putting off this book was not intentional, but perhaps fortunate. It is easier to understand our fellow mammals; birds are more distant and enigmatic. It has taken me all this time even to begin to learn how to probe their mysteries.<BR><br><BR>Birds have been trying to educate me since I was a child. I have always loved watching and reading about and learning from them. But even more importantly, birds always come into my life at critical moments to enrich my spirit and enlarge my heart.<BR><br><BR>The first male ever to court me?I was only a child but I loved him deeply?was a bird. I was seven. His name was Jerry. He was a green parakeet who came home with me from a dime store. And although I was delighted when he first agreed to perch on my hand and thrilled when he would finally fly to me, I was most honored when he threw up on my finger. Even though I had never seen any other creature do this in quite the same way, I understood what was happening&#58; he was feeding me. This was a mark of deep trust and affection, and he would do this only with me. He had taken me as his mate.<BR><br><BR>I was entranced and honored by everything Jerry did. I loved the way he used his curved beak to hull his round millet seeds. He?d pierce the husk with his lower mandible and peel the outer husk away by forcing the seed against his ridged palate and twirling it with his strong, muscular tongue. Jerry was thrillingly different from everyone else I had known. Even his digestive system was a radical departure from those of mammals, as I could clearly see from his droppings, which appeared from a single opening and incorporated both waste products in one neat little two-colored package. And of course I loved that Jerry could fly. I let him do so often, to my mother?s dismay. He liked to perch on the crystal chandelier over her prized mahogany dining room table, with predictable consequences.<BR><br><BR>People used to ask me if I wanted to teach Jerry to talk. I did not. I already had friends who talked. I wanted him to teach <i>me</i> what <i>he</i> knew, for I realized that he was the master and I the student. Among the many things he showed me was that birds stir our souls in ways that change our lives.<BR><br><BR>The ancients knew this well. Images of birds adorn the walls of the caves of Lascaux, accompanying prehistoric humans on the hunt. It?s easy to imagine why people carved pictures of birds on tombs as early as 2600 B.C. Birds fly through the air, the element of our breath; they symbolize the soul. From Sufi poetry to native American myths, from Egyptian tombs to Christian tapestries, birds beguile us. With their beauty, their songs, their flight, and their very strangeness, birds stir our deepest psychic strivings. Even the commonest of birds (remember Jonathan Livingston Seagull?) wield the power to thrill and inspire.<BR><br><BR>No wonder bird-watching is the fastest-growing of all outdoor activities in the United States and one of the most popular hobbies the world around. Happily, there are many hundreds of excellent books in print on bird-watching and classification. This book is not among them. Instead, these pages address a dilemma about which British author Tim Dee writes in his book <i>A Year on the Wing.</i> ?We seek the truth of birds through collection and classification,? he writes. But the truth of birds eludes us. Of a woodcock he recorded at age thirteen, he writes, ?I was sure of our identification ? but it offered so little of itself that I felt I had been simultaneously shown the bird and excluded from it.? He calls this ?the defining condition of bird-watching.? We can know a bird?s name; we can identify it and by its sighting add it to our ?life list?; but still, the essence of the bird flies away.<BR><br><BR>Even though birds are all around us, most of them are strangers. We don?t know them as individuals. We know very little of what it might be like to be a bird. If we did, we would be awestruck. That is the purpose of this book&#58; to restore both our awe and our connection to these winged aliens who live among us.<BR><br><BR>Birds are the only wild animals most people see every day. No matter where we live, birds live with us. Too many of us take them for granted. We don?t appreciate how very strange they are, how different. We don?t realize what otherworldly creatures birds are.<BR><br><BR>Their hearts look like those of crocodiles. Birds are covered with modified scales?we call them feathers. Their bones are hollow, permeated with extensive air sacs. They have no hands. They give birth to eggs.<BR><br><BR>No other scientific classification of living creature we commonly see is so different from us as is the class Aves. We don?t even think of birds as ?animals? (although they are?as are humans, of course). We consider ?animals? to be our fellow mammals, with whom our kinship is obvious. It?s easy to see a kindred soul when you look into the eyes of a chimp, for instance. They share more than 98 percent of our DNA. You can get a blood transfusion from a chimp. We shared a common ancestor with chimps as recently as 5 million years ago. But actually, all mammals now living (except for the pouched marsupials like kangaroos and the egg-laying platypus and echidna) share at least 90 percent of their genetic material with humans. We shared a common ancestor with even the most distant of our fellow placental mammals as recently as 100 million years ago. The last ancestor we shared with the birds, however, traces back 325 to 350 million years ago.<BR><br><BR>A bird is as distant from us as a dinosaur. But unlike the extinct monsters of the Jurassic and Cretaceous, birds today are everywhere among us?on our sidewalks, at our bird feeders, on our dinner plates. Yet despite our disparate evolutionary paths, scientists are now beginning to reveal the extent to which birds? emotional and intellectual abilities are remarkably like ours.<BR><br><BR>To understand birds is to appreciate at once their fundamental strangeness and sameness. What makes a bird a bird? To explore this question, in these pages I share my adventures with seven different bird species. Each chapter explores a different aspect of avian essence. Here are seven essential truths about birds.<BR><br><BR>In my opinion, the first thing you need to know about birds is that Birds Are Individuals. That?s why I begin this book with the Ladies, my flock of emotional, intelligent, and highly individualistic hens, who come when called, love to visit the neighbors, and befriend and feud with fellow chickens. Although a flock of hens is all about community, each chicken is quite distinctive, and the personality of each individual is extremely important to the flock dynamic. People who don?t know chickens are always astonished to learn this, but when you are in the company of birds, you must be prepared to be surprised.<BR><br><BR>A second fundamental truth of birds is that Birds Are Dinosaurs. That may be difficult to see when you?re watching a fluffy chickadee at the feeder, but it is abundantly clear when you are crashing through the rain forest of Queensland, Australia, pursuing a 150-pound cassowary, a bird as tall as a man, crowned with a helmet of bone on its head and a killer claw on each foot. Following these birds? tyrannosaur-like footprints, I traveled back in time, to an era of wondrous transformation.<BR><br><BR>The dinosaurian lineage that became the birds left the earth for the skies. And in doing this, they utterly reshaped their bodies inside and out. We mammals are made mainly of heavy fluids, but as I point out in another chapter, Birds Are Made of Air. Their bones are hollow; their feathers weigh more than the skeleton. Their bodies are full of air sacs; their feathers, also hollow shafted, are sculpted to capture and move air. Birds are essentially feather-fringed bubbles?a fact frustratingly poignant to bird rehabilitators, whose Herculean task it is to nurse back to health, or raise to adulthood, beings whose essential fragility gives them the power to conquer the sky. It was my great luck to apprentice myself to a woman whose job was yet more difficult than that of most bird rehabilitators. Brenda Sherburn?s specialty is raising orphaned baby hummingbirds, who hatch from eggs the size of navy beans and are born the size of bumblebees. They are air wrapped in light?the lightest birds in the sky.<BR><br><BR>What else must we know before we begin to understand what makes a bird a bird? Birds? wildness, for one. Even a pet parakeet, even a barnyard chicken is wild in a way that most mammals are not. To explore this, I embarked on a study of falconry, for the hawks and falcons exhibit a genius for instinct that showcases the brilliance of all birds? wildness.<BR><br><BR>Birds are able to apprehend the world in ways that we cannot. They can see polarized and ultraviolet light. They experience colors we can never know. They sense the earth?s magnetic field, navigate using subtle changes in odor and barometric pressure. They imbibe realities of this world that we cannot fathom and use them to circumnavigate the globe. We are only now starting to understand how birds accomplish these extraordinary feats, by way of one of our most ordinary and unappreciated birds, the pigeon?the hero of yet another chapter.<BR><br><BR>Though gifted with instincts and senses that we lack, birds? intellectual capacities are shockingly similar to our own. Some birds appreciate human art to the extent that they can learn to tell the difference between the paintings of Monet and those of Manet. Some birds love to dance?and in the course of researching this book, I got to dance with one of them. Birds? capacity for song is of course so legendary that many cultures tell us the birds taught music to humans. There are birds who can even speak to us meaningfully in our own language?something that, many scientists believe, even our close hominid cousins, the Neanderthals, probably could not do. But Birds Can Talk. In these pages, I relate some of what they tell us.<BR><br><BR>And finally, to apprehend the truth of birds, we need to appreciate birds? ubiquity&#58; Birds Are Everywhere. The final chapter takes us to a winter crow roost of tens of thousands of birds, a congregation that had been traditionally based in the countryside but, like the majority of the world?s population of humans, has moved into the city. How do the city?s people react to their new urban neighbors? And what does this say about the future of humans and birds living together on this sweet, green earth?<BR><br><BR>Just as I was beginning to research this book, my friend Gretchen Vogel called me with an unusual suggestion&#58; that we should go to church together. I was raised Methodist, she was raised Catholic, but the church she had in mind was the First Universalist Church in West Chesterfield, New Hampshire, about an hour?s drive from my house and twenty minutes from hers. She had read a notice in our local paper about that week?s sermon. The title was ?Birdology.? How could I resist?<BR><br><BR>The small church, built in 1830, had no cross in the front, and the ceiling inside was painted a light blue, like the sky. Gretchen and I joined six other people in the congregation that Sunday. Presiding was a visiting pastor, Rev. Elaine Bomford.<BR><br><BR>A smiling, articulate woman in her fifties, the pastor greeted us with the confession that ?birdology? was a word she had made up. She invented ?birdologist? to describe the person who?unlike the ornithologist, with his fancy university degree?hasn?t completed a formal course of avian study. To be a birdologist, she said, ?you just have to appreciate birds and be intentional about appreciating birds in some way.? We could all be birdologists, she said?and we should be. For watching birds, she told us, ?strengthens our souls.?<BR><br><BR>A birdologist, she explained, ?experiences the divinity of creation revealed in the birds.?<BR><br><BR>That pretty much describes what I have always felt when I see a bird?any bird. The ancients believed that birds could bring us messages from the gods&#58; whether a battle would be won or lost, or if plenty or famine would befall the city. Birds do bring us messages from the divine, but not necessarily those the ancients sought. Because of birds? very different lineage; because they are made of different stuff than we; because of the powers that birds possess that we do not; and because, despite our deep differences, we can share much of a bird?s mental and emotional experience, birds bring us news far more important than our own personal, human lives. They bring us news about the larger and more wondrous <i>life,</i> about a world that we, with our merely human senses, have barely begun to perceive.<BR><br><BR>Birds teach us reverence?a virtue that, writes classicist and philosopher Paul Woodruff, ?begins in a deep understanding of human limitations.? No beings show us our limitations better than do the birds. When we see a bird in flight or let our hearts soar on the notes of its song, the mystery of the world wells up before us?a mystery we long to embrace rather than conquer.<BR><br><BR>That day in the church, Rev. Bomford asked us to speak words with her from Terry Tempest Williams?s book <i>Refuge</i>.<BR><br><BR>?I pray to the birds,? we read, ?because I believe they will carry the messages of my heart upward ??<BR><br><BR>Oh, yes, I thought. It was then the time of the fall migration, and with every overhead ?V? I utter a prayer for the birds? safe passage.<BR><br><BR>?I pray to the birds,? we continued, ?because they remind me of what I love rather than what I fear ??<BR><br><BR>I thought back to my time with the emus. At first sight, I had fallen wildly, passionately, soul splittingly in love. I had been working alone, collecting plant samples on a wombat preserve in the outback, when I looked up and saw them&#58; three birds standing tall as a man, approaching me on their long, balletic, backward-bending legs?legs so strong they were capable of ending my life with a single kick. Instantly, I was smitten by both their strangeness and familiarity. There was no room for fear. My heart was filled with awe.<BR><br><BR>Reading Terry Tempest Williams?s words, I gave thanks for all the many birds I have loved in my life&#58; my parakeet Jerry; a cockatiel named Kokopelli who liked to sit on my head and whistle the National Geographic theme song when I was on the phone; my beloved Ladies. I did not know then, of course, that this book would bring me many more individual birds to love&#58; the dancing cockatoo Snowball; Harris?s hawks named Jazz and Fire and Smoke; a talking African grey parrot named Griffin; two orphaned baby hummingbirds who, God willing, could be raising babies of their own somewhere in California as I write these words right now.<BR><br><BR>? ? And at the end of my prayers,? the few of us gathered in the church that morning read, birds ?teach me how to listen.?<BR><br><BR>This was my prayer as I began working on this book. It?s my hope that the birds you will meet in these pages will teach you, too.<BR><br><BR>?Sy Montgomery<BR>May 19, 2009<BR>Hancock, N.H.<BR><br><BR>? 2010 Sy Montgomery <BR><BR><i>Continues...</i>  <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Birdology</b>  by <b>Sy Montgomery</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Sy Montgomery.
