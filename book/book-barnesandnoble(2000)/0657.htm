Stay faithful in spite of failure? No matter where people live or what their circumstances may be, everyone needs boundless, restorative love. Gorgeous and uplifting, <i>Tattoos on the Heart </i>amply demonstrates the impact unconditional love can have on your life.<P>As a pastor working in a neighborhood with the highest concentration of murderous gang activity in Los Angeles, Gregory Boyle created an organization to provide jobs, job training, and encouragement so that young people could work together and learn the mutual respect that comes from collaboration. <i>Tattoos on the Heart </i>is a breathtaking series of parables distilled from his twenty years in the barrio. Arranged by theme and filled with sparkling humor and glowing generosity, these essays offer a stirring look at how full our lives could be if we could find the joy in loving others and in being loved unconditionally. From giant, tattooed Cesar, shopping at JCPenney fresh out of prison, we learn how to feel worthy of God&#8217;s love. From ten-year-old Lula we learn the importance of being known and acknowledged.

Inspired by faith but applicable to anyone trying to be good, these personal, unflinching stories are full of surprising revelations and observations of the community in which Boyle works and of the many lives he has helped save. <P>Erudite, down-to-earth, and utterly heartening, these essays about universal kinship and redemptionare moving examples of the power of unconditional love in difficult times and the importance of fighting despair. With Gregory Boyle&#8217;s guidance, we can recognize our own wounds in the broken lives and daunting struggles of the men and women in these parables and learn to find joy in all of the people around us. <i>Tattoos on the Heart </i>reminds us that no life is less valuable than another.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this artful, disquieting, yet surprisingly jubilant memoir, Jesuit priest Boyle recounts his two decades of working with &ldquo;homies&rdquo; in Los Angeles County, which contains 1,100 gangs with nearly 86,000 members. Boyle&rsquo;s Homeboy Industries is the largest gang intervention program in the country, offering job training, tattoo removal, and employment to members of enemy gangs. Effectively straddling the debate regarding where the responsibility for urban violence lies, Boyle both recounts the despair of watching &ldquo;the kids you love cooperate in their own demise&rdquo; and levels the challenge to readers to &ldquo;stand in awe at what the poor have to carry rather than stand in judgment at how they carry it.&rdquo; From moving vignettes about gangsters breaking into tears or finding themselves worthy of love and affirmation, to moments of spiritual reflection and sidesplittingly funny banter between him and the homies, Boyle creates a convincing and even joyful treatise on the sacredness of every life. Considering that he has buried more than 150 young people from gang-related violence, the joyful tenor of the book remains an astounding literary and spiritual feat. (Mar.)

He received his Master of Divinity from the Weston School of Theology; and a Sacred Theology Masters degree from the Jesuit School of Theology. In 1988, Father Boyle began what would become Homeboy Industries, now located in downtown Los Angeles. Fr. Greg received the California Peace Prize, the &ldquo;Humanitarian of the Year&rdquo; Award from <i>Bon App - tit</i>; the Caring Institute's 2007 Most Caring People Award; and received the 2008 Civic Medal of Honor from the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. <P>Since 1986, Father Gregory has been the pastor of Dolores Mission in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. The church sits between two large public housing projects, Pico Gardens and Aliso Village, known for decades as the gang capital of the world. There are 1,100 gangs encompassing 86,000 members in Los Angeles, and Boyle Heights has the highest concentration of murderous gang activity in the city. Since Father Greg&#151;also known affectionately as G-dog, started Homeboy Industries nearly twenty years ago, it has served members of more than half of the gangs in Los Angeles. In Homeboy Industries' various businesses&#151;baking, silkscreening, landscaping&#151;gang affiliations are left outside as young people work together, side by side, learning the mutual respect that comes from building something together.

											Father Boyle has been living out his faith and his calling for more than 20 years. How smart and talented people have the heart to love so deeply is a cause for much reflection. Most of the really smart and talented people I meet are so into &quot;self&quot; that there's no space for the compassion we encounter in &quot;TATOOS ON THE HEART.&quot;<p/><p/>You'll find each page a source of inspiration and a challenge to reflect..<p/><p/>Retired Teacher<p/>Orange, CA</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Compassion made real with the gangs of LA<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=ChristysBookBlog">ChristysBookBlog</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1367020_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781439153024_BK_2_1367020" href="#previewReview_1367020" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>April 24, 2010: 
											Tattoos of the Heart by Father Gregory Boyle is the kind of book I want to press into the hands of everyone I know to make them read it and love it as I do. Boyle is the creator of Homeboy Industries which employs gang members in Los Angeles. Originally a bakery, it has grown to a silk screening business, graffiti removal business, plus more. They provide counseling, tattoo removal, and a wide range of other services for the entire community. Boyle fills the book with an assortment of anecdotes from the hilarious to the outrageous to the tragic. While reading, I kept sharing different stories aloud with my husband, because they are so stunning, I just had to share them. The message that Boyle wants his readers to get is that every single one of these gangbangers, no matter how hardcore, are in need of love, and to know that they have personal worth and value. He has faced a lot of prejudice in his dealings with them, and to the average reader, some of these people are truly frightening, but Boyle makes them always human and fragile. He speaks their language and gives them the opportunity to get a job, and to shatter the limitations imposed upon them by a variety of societal conditions. Boyle doesn't just share the &quot;success&quot; stories, but he wants to change the reader's definition of success. It can't be measured by a number of jobs or education, but by the number of hearts changed permanently by an organization who pours out the unconditional love of God. I dare you to read this book and not be moved by the stories within. Try not to cry as a mother loses yet another son to senseless violence.  Don't smile when reading as a former gangbanger shares how he reads stories with his children each night before bed. These stories will tattoo themselves onto your heart.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P><b>H</b>ow do you fight despair and learn to meet the world with a loving heart?

Effectively straddling the debate regarding where the responsibility for urban violence lies, Boyle both recounts the despair of watching &ldquo;the kids you love cooperate in their own demise&rdquo; and levels the challenge to readers to &ldquo;stand in awe at what the poor have to carry rather than stand in judgment at how they carry it.&rdquo; From moving vignettes about gangsters breaking into tears or finding themselves worthy of love and affirmation, to moments of spiritual reflection and sidesplittingly funny banter between him and the homies, Boyle creates a convincing and even joyful treatise on the sacredness of every life. Considering that he has buried more than 150 young people from gang-related violence, the joyful tenor of the book remains an astounding literary and spiritual feat. (Mar.)

I'm certain we all have an image of God  that becomes the touchstone, the controlling principle, to which we return when  we stray.  <p>  My touchstone image of God comes by way of my friend and spiritual director,  Bill Cain, S.J. Years ago he took a break from his own ministry to care for his  father as he died of cancer. His father had become a frail man, dependent on  Bill to do everything for him. Though he was physically not what he had been,  and the disease was wasting him away, his mind remained alert and lively. In the  role reversal common to adult children who care for their dying parents, Bill  would put his father to bed and then read him to sleep, exactly as his father  had done for him in childhood. Bill would read from some novel, and his father  would lie there, staring at his son, smiling. Bill was exhausted from the day's  care and work and would plead with his dad, "Look, here's the idea. I read to  you, you fall asleep." Bill's father would impishly apologize and dutifully  close his eyes. But this wouldn't last long. Soon enough, Bill's father would  pop one eye open and smile at his son. Bill would catch him and whine, "Now,  come on." The father would, again, oblige, until he couldn't anymore, and the  other eye would open to catch a glimpse of his son. This went on and on, and  after his father's death, Bill knew that this evening ritual was really a story  of a father who just couldn't take his eyes off his kid. How much more so God?  Anthony De Mello writes, "Behold the One beholding you, and smiling."  <p>  God would seem to be too occupied in being unable to take Her eyes off of us to  spend any time raising an eyebrow in disapproval. What's true of Jesus is true  for us, and so this voice breaks through the clouds and comes straight at us.  "You are my Beloved, in whom I am wonderfully pleased." There is not much "tiny"  in that.  <p>                               * * *  <p>  In 1990 the television news program <i>60 Minutes</i> came to Dolores Mission Church.  One of its producers had read a Sunday <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i> article about  my work with gang members in the housing projects. Mike Wallace, also seeing the  piece, wanted to do a report. I was assured that I'd be getting "Good Mike."  These were the days when the running joke was "you know you're going to have a  bad day when Mike Wallace and a <i>60 Minutes</i> film crew show up at your office."  <p>  Wallace arrived at the poorest parish in Los Angeles in the stretchest of white  limousines, stepped out of the car, wearing a flak jacket, covered with pockets,  prepared, I suppose, for a journey into the jungle.  <p>  For all his initial insensitivity, toward the end of the visit, in a moment  unrecorded, Wallace did say to me, "Can I admit something? I came here expecting  monsters. But that's not what I found."  <p>  Later, in a recorded moment, we are sitting in a classroom filled with gang  members, all students in our Dolores Mission Alternative School. Wallace points  at me and says, "You won't turn these guys in to the police." Which seems quite  silly to me at the time. I say something lame like, "I didn't take my vows to  the LAPD." But then Wallace turns to a homie and grills him on this, saying over  and over, "He won't turn you in, will he?" And then he asks the homie, "Why is  that? Why do you think he won't turn you over to the police?" The kid just  stares at Mike Wallace, shrugs, nonplussed, and says, "God ... I guess."  <p>  This is a chapter on God, I guess. Truth be told, the whole book is. Not much in  my life makes any sense outside of God. Certainly, a place like Homeboy  Industries is all folly and bad business unless the core of the endeavor seeks  to imitate the kind of God one ought to believe in. In the end, I am helpless to  explain why anyone would accompany those on the margins were it not for some  anchored belief that the Ground of all Being thought this was a good idea.  <p>                               * * *  <p>  Rascal is not one to take advice. He can be recalcitrant, defensive, and primed  for the fight. Well into his thirties, he's a survivor. His truck gets filled  with scrap metal and with this, somehow, he feeds his kids and manages to stay  on this side of eviction. To his credit, he bid prison time and gang-banging  good-bye a long time ago. Rascal sometimes hits me up for funds, and I oblige if  I have it <i>and</i> if his attitude doesn't foul my mood too much. But you can't tell  him anything-except this one day, he actually listens. I am going on about  something-can't remember what but I can see he's listening. When I'm done, he  says simply, "You know, I'm gonna take that advice, and I'm gonna let it  marinate," pointing at his heart, "right here."  <p>  Perhaps we should all marinate in the intimacy of God. Genesis, I suppose, got  it right-"In the beginning, God." Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the  Jesuits, also spoke about the task of marinating in the "God who is always  greater."  <p>  He writes, "Take care always to keep before your eyes, first, God." The secret,  of course, of the ministry of Jesus, was that God was at the center of it. Jesus  chose to marinate in the God who is always greater than our tiny conception, the  God who "loves without measure and without regret." To anchor yourself in this,  to keep always before your eyes this God is to choose to be intoxicated,  marinated in the fullness of God. An Algerian Trappist, before his martyrdom,  spoke to this fullness&#58; "When you fill my heart, my eyes overflow."  <p>                               * * *  <p>  Willy crept up on me from the driver's side. I had just locked the office and  was ready to head home at 8&#58;00 p.m.  <p>  "Shit, Willy," I say, "Don't be doin' that."  <p>  "'<i>Spensa</i>, G," he says, "My bad. It's just ... well, my stomach's on <i>&eacute;chale</i>. Kick  me down with twenty bones, yeah?"  <p>  "Dog, my wallet's on <i>&eacute;chale</i>," I tell him. A "dog" is the one upon whom you can  rely-the role-dog, the person who has your back. "But get in. Let's see if I can  trick any funds outta  the ATM."  <p>  Willy hops on board. He is a life force of braggadocio and posturing-a  thoroughly good soul-but his confidence is outsize, that of a lion wanting you  to know he just swallowed a man whole. A gang member, but a peripheral one at  best-he wants more to regale you with his exploits than to actually be in the  midst of any. In his midtwenties, Willy is a charmer, a quintessential homie con  man who's apt to coax money out of your ATM if you let him. This night, I'm  tired and I want to go home.  <p>  It's easier not to resist. The Food 4 Less on Fourth and Soto has the closest  ATM. I tell Willy to stay in the car, in case we run into one of Willy's rivals  inside.  <p>  "Stay here, dog," I tell him, "I'll be right back."  <p>  I'm not ten feet away when I hear a muffled "Hey."  <p>  It's Willy, and he's miming, "the keys," from the passenger seat of my car. He's  making over-the-top, key-in-the-ignition <i>se&ntilde;ales</i>.  <p>  "The radio," he mouths, as he holds a hand, cupping his ear.  <p>  I wag a finger, "No, <i>chale</i>." Then it's my turn to mime. I hold both my hands  together and enunciate exaggeratedly, <i>"Pray."</i>  <p>  Willy sighs and levitates his eyeballs. But he's putty. He assumes the praying  hands pose and looks heavenward-<i>cara santucha</i>. I proceed on my quest to the ATM  but feel the need to check in on Willy only ten yards later.  <p>  I turn and find him still in the prayer position, seeming to be only half-aware  that I'm looking in on him.  <p>  I return to the car, twenty dollars in hand, and get in. Something has happened  here. Willy is quiet, reflective, and there is a palpable sense of peace in the  vehicle. I look at Willy and say, "You prayed, didn't you?"  <p>  He doesn't look at me. He's still and quiet. "Yeah, I did."  <p>  I start the car.  <p>  "Well, what did God say to you?" I ask him.  <p>  "Well, first He said, <i>'Shut up and listen.'</i>"  <p>  "So what d'ya do?"  <p>  "Come on, G," he says, "What am I sposed ta do? I shut up and listened."  <p>  I begin to drive him home to the barrio. I've never seen Willy like this. He's  quiet and humble-no need to convince me of anything or talk me out of something  else.  <p>  "So, son, tell me something," I ask. "How do you see God?"  <p>  "God?" he says, "That's my dog right there."  <p>  "And God?" I ask, "How does God see you?"  <p>  Willy doesn't answer at first. So I turn and watch as he rests his head on the  recliner, staring at the ceiling of my car. A tear falls down his cheek. Heart  full, eyes overflowing. "God ... thinks  ... I'm ... <i>firme</i>."  <p>  To the homies, <i>firme</i> means, "could not be one bit better."  <p>  Not only does God think we're <i>firme</i>, it is God's joy to have us marinate in  that.  <p>                               * * *  <p>  The poet Kabir asks, "What is God?" Then he answers his own question&#58; "God is  the breath inside the breath."  <p>  Willy found his way inside the breath and it was <i>firme</i>.  <p>  I came late to this understanding in my own life-helped along by the  grace-filled pedagogy of the people of Dolores Mission. I was brought up and  educated to give assent to certain propositions. God is love, for example. You  concede "God loves us," and yet there is this lurking sense that perhaps you  aren't fully part of the "us." The arms of God reach to embrace, and somehow you  feel yourself just outside God's fingertips.  <p>  Then you have no choice but to consider that "God loves me," yet you spend much  of your life unable to shake off what feels like God only embracing you  begrudgingly and reluctantly. I suppose, if you insist, God has to love me too.  Then who can explain this next moment, when the utter fullness of God rushes in  on you-when you completely know the One in whom "you move and live and have your  being," as St. Paul writes. You see, then, that it has been God's joy to love  you all along. And this is completely new.  <p>  Every time one of the Jesuits at Dolores Mission would celebrate a birthday, the  same ritual would repeat itself. "You know," one of the other Jesuits would say  to me, for example, "Your birthday is Wednesday. The people are throwing a  'surprise party' for you on the Saturday before." The protests are as  predictable as the festivities.  <p>  "Oh come on," I'd say, "Can't we pass this year?"  <p>  "Look," one of my brothers would say to me, "This party is not for you-it's for  the people."  <p>  And so I am led into the parish hall for some bogus meeting, and I can hear the  people "shushing" one another-<i>El Padre ya viene</i>. As I step in the door, lights  go on, people shout, mariachis strike themselves up. I am called upon to muster  up the same award-winning look of shock from last year. They know that you know.  They don't care. They don't just love you-it's their joy to love you.  <p>  The poet Rumi writes, "Find the real world, give it endlessly away, grow rich  flinging gold to all who ask. Live at the empty heart of paradox. I'll dance  there with you-cheek to cheek."  <p>  Dancing <i>cumbias</i> with the women of Dolores Mission rhymes with God's own wild  desire to dance with each one of us cheek to cheek.  <p>  Meister Eckhart says "God is greater than God." The hope is that our sense of  God will grow as expansive as our God is. Each tiny conception gets obliterated  as we discover more and more the God who is always greater.  <p>                               * * *  <p>  At Camp Paige, a county detention facility near Glendora, I was getting to know  fifteen-year-old Rigo, who was about to make his first communion. The Catholic  volunteers had found him a white shirt and black tie. We still had some fifteen  minutes before the other incarcerated youth would join us for Mass in the gym,  and I'm asking Rigo the basic stuff about his family and his life. I ask about  his father.  <p>  "Oh," he says, "he's a heroin addict and never really been in my life. Used to  always beat my ass. Fact, he's in prison right now. Barely ever lived with us."  <p>  Then something kind of snaps in him-an image brings him to attention.  <p>  "I think I was in the fourth grade," he begins. "I came home. Sent home in the  middle of the day. Got into some <i>pedo</i> at school. Can't remember what. When I got  home, my <i>jefito</i> was there. He was hardly ever there. My dad says, 'Why they send  you home?' And cuz my dad always beat me, I said, 'If I tell you, promise you  won't hit me?' He just said, 'I'm your father. 'Course I'm not gonna hit you.'  So I told him."  <p>  Rigo is caught short in the telling. He begins to cry, and in moments he's  wailing and rocking back and forth. I put my arm around him. He is inconsolable.  <p>  When he is able to speak and barely so, he says only, "He beat me with a pipe ...  with ... a pipe."  <p>  When Rigo composes himself, I ask, "And your mom?" He points some distance from  where we are to a tiny woman standing by the gym's entrance.  <p>  "That's her over there." He pauses for a beat, "There's no one like her." Again,  some slide appears in his mind, and a thought occurs.  <p>  "I've been locked up for more than a year and a half. She comes to see me every  Sunday. You know how many buses she takes every Sunday-to see my sorry ass?"  <p>  Then quite unexpectedly he sobs with the same ferocity as before. Again, it  takes him some time to reclaim breath and an ability to speak. Then he does,  gasping through his tears. "Seven buses. She takes ... seven ... buses. Imagine."  <p>  How, then, to imagine, the expansive heart of this God-greater than God-who  takes seven buses, just to arrive at us. We settle sometimes for less than  intimacy with God when all God longs for is this solidarity with us. In Spanish,  when you speak of your great friend, you describe the union and kinship as being  <i>de u&ntilde;a y mugre</i>-our friendship is like the fingernail and the dirt under it. Our  image of who God is and what's on God's mind is more tiny than it is troubled.  It trips more on our puny sense of God than over conflicting creedal statements  or theological considerations.  <p>  The desire of God's heart is immeasurably larger than our imaginations can  conjure. This longing of God's to give us peace and assurance and a sense of  well-being only awaits our willingness to cooperate with God's limitless  magnanimity.  <p>                               * * *  <p>  "Behold the One beholding you and smiling." It is precisely because we have such  an overactive disapproval gland ourselves that we tend to create God in our own  image. It is truly hard for us to see the truth that disapproval does not seem  to be part of God's DNA. God is just too busy loving us to have any time left  for disappointment.  <p>                               * * *  <p>  One day I receive a phone call in my office around three in the afternoon. It's  from a twenty-five-year-old homie named Cesar. I have known him for most of his  life. I can remember first meeting him when he was a little kid in Pico Gardens  during the earthquake of 1987 when the projects had become a tent city. People  lived outside in <i>carpas</i> well past the time of any danger. Cesar was one of the  many kids seeking reassurance from me.  <p>  "Are we gonna be okay? Is this the end of the world?"  <p>  I spent every evening of those two weeks walking the tents, and I always  associate Cesar with that period.  <p>  He's calling me today because he has just finished a four-year stint in prison.  Turned out, earthquakes were the least of Cesar's troubles. He had joined the  local gang, since there wasn't anyone around to "chase his ass" and rein him in.  At this point in his life, Cesar had been locked up more often than not. Cesar  and I chitchat on the phone, dispatching the niceties in short order-"It's good  to be out-I'd love to see ya"-then Cesar says, "Let me just cut to the cheese."  <p>  This was not a spin I had heard on this expression before.  <p>  "You know, I just got outta the <i>pinta</i> and don't really have a place to stay.  Right now, I'm staying with a friend in his apartment-here in El Monte-away from  the projects and the hood and the homies. <i>Y sabes qu&eacute;</i>, I don't got no clothes.  My lady she left me, and she burned all my clothes, you know, in some anger  toward me, I guess."  <p>  I'm waiting for him to cut to the cheese.  <p>  "So I don't got no clothes," he says. "Can you help me?"  <p>  "Sure, son," I say, "Look, it's three now. I'll pick you up after work, at six  o'clock."  <p>  I drive to the apartment at the appointed hour, and I'm surprised to see Cesar  standing on the sidewalk waiting for me-I'm used to searching for homies when  asked to retrieve them. I guess you might say that Cesar is a scary-looking guy.  It's not just the fact that he's large and especially, fresh out of prison,  newly "swole" from lifting weights. He exudes menace. So there he is, standing  and waiting for me. When he sees it's me, this huge ex-con does this bouncing up  and down, yippy-skippy, happy-to-see-ya, hand-clapping gleeful jig.  <p>  He flies into my car and throws his arms around me. "When I saw you right now,  G, I got aaaallllll happy!"  <p>  There was some essence to him that hadn't changed from that child wanting to  know that the world was safe from earthquakes.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Tattoos on the Heart</b> by <b>Gregory Boyle</b>  Copyright &copy; 2010   by Gregory Boyle.
