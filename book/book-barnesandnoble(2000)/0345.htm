Though the lawyer Baron Bell who arranged for the surrogate mother charged a hefty six-figure fee, one glance into the eyes of their precious children told them it was all worth it - until the birth mother reappeared, first demanding more money, then the twins themselves. Suddenly Baron Bell was nowhere to be found, and the Dawsons were once again childless, heartbroken and nearly destitute.<P>When the case finds its way to the offices of high-profile attorney Lizzie Fox, she can&rsquo;t wait to take down the so-called &ldquo;Mr. Wonderful.&rdquo; And she knows she&rsquo;ll have all the help she needs as it&rsquo;s just the kind of crime that really gets the Sisterhood&rsquo;s adrenalin flowing. Once they get their hands on the perpetrators there will be hell to pay, and it will cost a lot more than cold, hard cash.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>With over than sixty million copies of her books sold around the world, <I>New York Times</I> bestselling author Fern Michaels pens romance after epic romance, each filled with all the drama and heartbreak her loyal fans can handle.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><h3>Customer Reviews</h3><ul class="reviewBox"><li class="first">Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget " id="9781420106862_BK"><span class="avg-4 section_updateRating"></span></span></li><li>Ratings: 27<span id="numReviews">Reviews: 8</span></li><li><a name="seeAllReviewsContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-All-Reviews">See All Reviews</a></li><li><p class="writeReview"><strong><a name="writeReview_OverviewTab" class="section_writeReview" rel="nofollow" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-Write-A-Review" href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/WriteReview.aspx?EAN=9781420106862"></a></strong></p></li></ul><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>vigalantes ride again<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-3"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1390166_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781420106862_BK_1_1390166" href="#previewReview_1390166" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 17, 2010: 
											I like reading about the vigalantes, but this book was just too busy for me.  It was hard for me to keep up with which story thread was going with which.  I know they all go together, but come on!  I don't need every single charater built in a ongoing series like this!  We are talking about 14 charaters that, while important to the actual story, and not all of them needed to grow.  Hearing how the guys took care of the babies - now that was funny and pretty realistic.  But I had to re-read parts just to figure out where the story line was going.<p/><p/>Have teasers for other books at the end of a book is one thing.  This had CHAPTERS from other books in the series.  I love to read about the vigalantes, but not 3-4 chapters!  Especially since I am a vigalante follower - reading about a book that was already released was just a waste of my time and the money I spent on the book.  I LOVE books, not cd's not electronic forms - real books.  I know that the publishers were trying to get further book sales, but come on!</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>The sisterhood again!<em>by <a href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/userProfile.aspx?penName=HSmom92">HSmom92</a></em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1376719_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781420106862_BK_1_1376719" href="#previewReview_1376719" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 05, 2010: 
											Fern Michaels continues with the Sisterhood series with this book about Rachel and Thomas Dawson, a couple in their late thirties who hire a surrogate in order to have a baby, things happen and the surrogate changes her mind and keeps the baby.  With the normal sisterhood fashion, this book involved the reader to a point that all questions may not be answered - very good!</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/37160000/37160682.JPG" alt="" height="160" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Fern Michaels</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>Mary Kuczkir</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Summerville, South Carolina</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Hastings, Pennsylvania</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>High School</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Born Mary Ruth Kuczkir in Hastings, Pennsylvania, Fern Michaels was married and the mother of five before she embarked on her long, successful writing career � a career that began with something midway between a challenge and a command. When her youngest child went off to kindergarten, Michaels's husband imperiously ordered her (in just so many words) to get off her ass and get a job. Long years in the domestic trenches had left her short on marketable skills, so she decided trade off her lifelong love of reading and write a book. Just like that. The domineering, unsupportive husband is history. And Michaels has gone on to pen bestselling romance after bestselling romance. Just like that..<p>    With typical modesty, Michaels does not claim to be a great writer; however, she admits proudly to being a born storyteller. Her bulging bookshelf proves she is all over the map, producing with equal facility hot historicals, lighthearted contemporary capers, adrenaline-laced thrillers, and heartwarming tales of family and friendship. She is especially adept at writing stories about women who prevail in hard times � a reflection, perhaps, of her own struggles in her marriage and early career.<p>     Raised to believe that the fortunate in life  have an obligation to give back, Michaels devotes a lot of time to philanthropic concerns. She has established a foundation that grants four-year scholarships to needy students and has set up pre-schools and daycare centers for single mothers. She is also an avid animal lover and has been known to own as many as five dogs at a time.<p>     In 1993, Michaels picked up stakes and moved from her home in New Jersey to a 300-year-old plantation house in Charleston, South Carolina. She and the dogs share the house amicably with a friendly ghost whom Fern has dubbed Mary Margaret. In addition to stopping clocks and moving pillows from room to room, Mary Margaret has been known to occasionally leave flowers on Michaels's nightstand!</p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><b>Michaels confesses in our interview:</b> "I'm a junk food junkie and a chocoholic. My desk drawers have more junk food in them than paper and pens. I chomp and chew all day long. At night I get up and eat Marshmallow Fluff right out of the jar. In between eating, I write."<p>    <b>Her first "sort of, kind of job"</b> was in market research. Michaels recounts the gig's low-point in our interview: "I had a partner and we were testing a new pressurized drain cleaner. All you had to do was put this can in the drain, squeeze and supposedly the drain would open right up. It did, all right. <p>    "The whole wall collapsed, and stuff that was in there for a hundred years flew everywhere. The lady didn't tell us the drain backed up to her kitchen drain and disposal. The company didn't care that we smelled like a sewer or that our clothes were ruined. The lady got a new bathroom, and we both got fired." <p>     <b>Michaels reveals some of her sources</b> of inspiration: "Inspiration comes from everywhere. The title for <I>Finders Keepers</I> came from a cartoon with two chipmunks that my grandson was watching. I had a title but no story. I finally came up with one to fit that wonderful title. <p>    "Names for characters sometime come from television. I had a character named Metaxis which is odd to begin with. There is a news anchor on T.V. who has that same last name. Sometimes it will just be a word someone says in passing, something I read or saw. There's no rhyme or reason to it. It's almost like, okay, I need something here, stay alert and it will happen."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the fall of 2002, Fern Michaels answered some of our questions.</I><p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life -- and why?</b> <br>  It was a Nancy Drew book titled, <I>The Mystery of the Brass Bound Trunk</I> by Carolyn Keene. As a child, it had everything: a secret, a challenge, a young woman detective who drove a car, her family, her best friends, and who had an insatiable curiosity. I wanted to do what Carolyn Keene did -- write about a secrets, challenges, and women who persevered.

Been there, done that, as the saying goes. These days I spend a lot of time with my kids. I am a big animal rights activist and do all I can for them. I read, do a little gardening. Mostly I write. I like to buy furniture and kitchen gadgets. I have seven T.V.s in my house and turn them all on to news channels. I don't want to miss anything that is going on in the world.<p>    What I love most in the world are my kids and my grandkids and my five dogs. I have a very whimsical area on my second floor where all my dogs are painted on the walls. The ones who have gone over The Rainbow Bridge all have gold halos. Sometimes I go up there and cry.<p>    How do I unwind? With all the dogs on or around me. With a cigarette and a beer. Yes, I know, I shouldn't be doing that but I do. Sometimes if it's really stressful, I take the dogs for a run around my four acres. We run till we're breathless. When I can't sleep, I get up and go out on the verandah and listen to all the night sounds and drink a cup of tea. Along with that, Marshmallow Fluff I buy by the case. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><P>After years of trying to become pregnant without success, Rachel Dawson and her husband Thomas felt their dreams had finally come true the day they brought home their newly adopted twin babies.

She was not, she had to remind herself,  a starstruck tourist. She was there for lunch and  so much more.  <p>     The president herself opened the door and literally  dragged Lizzie inside with a whispered, "I'll  take it from here, Agent Goodwin." She smiled  warmly at her friend. "God, Lizzie, I am so glad  to see you! I mean I'm <i>really</i> glad!"  <p>     "Me too, Madam President." And she <i>was</i>  glad. She and President Connor had a history.  Then they wrapped their arms around each  other in a bone-crushing hug, strange for two  such elegant women.  <p>     President Connor laughed. "Stop with that  'Madam President' stuff. In here we're Lizzie and  Marti. I <i>need</i> you to call me by my name, Lizzie.  I don't want to forget who I really am. Can we  do that?" She sounded so anxious, Lizzie nodded.  <p>     Lizzie looked around. "Pretty fancy digs,  Marti. This is my first time in the White House.  I'm impressed. The Christmas decorations are  beautiful."  <p>     "If you have the time, I'll give you the tour  after lunch. Right nowI want you all to myself. I  can't thank you enough for accepting my invitation.  You look so happy, Lizzie."  <p>     Lizzie smiled as she was shown to a deep off-white  chair that would have held both her and  Cosmo. She watched as the president sat down  across from her and kicked off her shoes. Lizzie  did the same thing, and they giggled like two  schoolgirls.  <p>     "There are no words to tell you how happy I  am, Marti. I wish I could say the same for you.  You look like you have the weight of the world  on your shoulders."  <p>     Martine Connor forced a smile she was far  from feeling. "I <i>do</i> have the weight of the world  on my shoulders. See how bowed they are. And  before you can ask, the world slowed down for  some reason this week to allow me time for this  luncheon."  <p>     "You want to talk about it, or is it all NTK?  Your approval ratings are in the seventy percent  range, so you must be doing something right."  <p>     Martine shrugged. "I had a hard time getting  used to having every second of my time budgeted.  Sometimes bathroom breaks are a luxury.  There's always a crisis that has to be dealt with  brewing somewhere. You know me. I'm cool  under fire. It's when I get up here that I lose it."  <p>     Lizzie blinked. "This was what you wanted,  Marti."  <p>     Martine brushed at the soft bangs falling over  her forehead. "Yes, and if it weren't for you ...  and ... your friends, I wouldn't be here. I know  that, Lizzie. It's with me every second of every  day. That's why you're here, isn't it? That's why  you accepted my job offer, right? You're here to  spell it out to me. Again."  <p>     Lizzie stared at her old friend. She gave a  slight nod. "Six months. Pro bono. I walk away  unless the job proves to be something beyond my  expectations. I have to admit, I was surprised you  agreed to my terms."  <p>     Martine burst out laughing. "Oh, Lizzie, I  wish you could have seen the expressions on all  <i>their</i> faces when I listed your demands. I thought  the lot of them would choke to death. Nine to  five! Every weekend off. Pro bono. I realize one  hundred sixty-eight thousand dollars is a lot of  money, and yet it isn't much to live on here in  the District, what with rent, travel back to one's  home state, taxes, everyday expenses, and maintaining  two residences. It's hard to raise a family  and keep up two residences, all for the sake of  doing one's duty. When I told them you weren't  interested in adding the White House to your  r&eacute;sum&eacute;, because yours was impressive enough  without it, several of them had to be resuscitated.  It's safe to say your fame has preceded you. Actually,  Lizzie, you're a legend in your own time,  and I, for one, am honored to be called your  friend. How does your new husband feel about  your taking on the job?"  <p>     Lizzie leaned forward. "You know what,  Marti? My husband is that rare breed of man  who only wants to see me happy. If all it takes is  his approval, he's all for it. We take turns traveling  on the weekends. You need to give him a  huge slice of credit for helping get you to where  you're sitting right now." Lizzie looked around  and lowered her voice. "Is this place bugged? Are  you recording me?"  <p>     "Lizzie!"  <p>     Martine's outrage was so total, Lizzie relaxed.  "What I was going to say was, my husband numbers  among his friends some of the most powerful,  some of the most respected, some of the  richest people in the world, and those he doesn't  know personally, he has access to via those same  friends in his Rolodex. You should see his Rolodex,  Marti. I think it's safe to say your own cannot  compare."  <p>     "What are you trying to tell me, Lizzie?"  There was an edge to Martine's voice that did  not go unnoticed by Lizzie.  <p>     "Nothing, Marti. I was simply commenting on  your question about my husband."  <p>     "Point taken."  <p>     There was a knock at the door, and a white-coated  waiter indicated that lunch was ready in  the little breakfast nook, as requested by the  president.  <p>     "Our lunch is ready. It's one of the perks here.  I hope you enjoy it," Martine said as she rose and  led Lizzie down the hall. When they reached  their destination, she nodded to the waiter to  show that he could leave. "I know you don't like  to eat heavily at lunch, and most days I don't  have time for lunch. We're having sesame-crusted  salmon, grilled asparagus, and a garden salad."  <p>     It looked delicious, but Lizzie wasn't hungry.  She lifted the glass of iced tea set by her plate  and clinked it against Martine's. "Here's to a  thankful Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas,  Madam President."  <p>     "And the same to you, Lizzie."  <p>     The bite was still in Martine's voice, Lizzie noticed.  Well, she hadn't invited herself here. She  was the invitee. She smiled as she mashed the  salmon on her plate. Martine was cutting her asparagus  into tiny pieces. Lizzie couldn't help but  wonder if she was going to eat it or if she was  just playing with her food, too.  <p>     "Does my office have a window, Marti?"  <p>     Martine offered up a genuine smile this time.  "It was one of your requirements, so yes, your office  has a window. You did say you would be willing  to negotiate the second half of the year. Is  that still on the table?"  <p>     Lizzie mashed the salmon some more. "Yes,  but no promises. So, tell me now, who do I have  to watch out for?"  <p>     "Everyone would be my guess. You've been  Googled so much since we made the announcement,  I'm surprised the site didn't shut down.  You're the next thing to Public Enemy Number  One at Sixteen Hundred Pennsylvania Avenue.  My chief of staff understands that you are to  have direct access to me twenty-four-seven. Of  course, he went ballistic, but we're on the same  page now. Everyone is replaceable. He understands  that, too."  <p>     "Guess you aren't going to eat that asparagus.  You must have a hundred little pieces on your  plate."  <p>     "You always were perceptive, Lizzie. I'm listening  when you're ready to talk."  <p>     "My friends are very unhappy, Marti. I  thought you would have gotten the message  when your Secret Service agents were thrown  into a Dumpster and their weapons and badges  were sent back to you."  <p>     Martine started to mash her salmon the way  Lizzie had. "We're going to have to put all this  food in the disposal so the kitchen doesn't get  their knickers in a knot. I did get the message. I  wasn't amused. We had to do some fancy dancing  to explain all that."  <p>     "I bet you did. My friends weren't amused  either. You have six months to keep your promise."  <p>     "I can't believe you're giving the president of  this country an ultimatum! And if for some reason  I can't deliver on the promise in the allotted  time, then what?" Martine asked in the same  frosty tone.  <p>     Lizzie smiled. "Marti, I might be many things,  but I'm not clairvoyant."  <p>     "What? Are you seriously warning me that the  vigilantes can penetrate the White House? Is  that what you're telling me? Are you telling me  they're smart enough to outwit the best of the  best? It's simply not possible. What are they  going to do, hold a gun to my head and make  me sign a pardon and then we're all going to  disappear in a puff of smoke?"  <p>     Lizzie was pleased at the look of pure horror  on the president's face. She continued to smile.  "I said no such thing. That's your interpretation.  Although the ladies did take on your  Secret Service and come out on top. And if I remember  correctly, that little neighborhood  White House luncheon you sponsored didn't go  over so well either. Your guests were more impressed  with their ride home, compliments of  the vigilantes, than they were with your luncheon,  the photo op, and their souvenirs."  <p>     Martine Connor got up and carried the two  luncheon plates to the sink in the main part of  the kitchen. She scraped the plates and turned  on the garbage disposal. Lizzie listened to the  loud clunking noise followed by a shrieking,  grinding sound.  <p>     "The plumbing leaves a lot to be desired,"  Martine said.  <p>     "You could call a plumber," Lizzie volunteered.  <p>     "It doesn't work that way here. In the real  world, yes. I can't even describe to you what it's  like living here. I can't step out and go to the  drugstore to get shampoo. If I want to do that, I  have to notify the Service a month in advance.  Then they have to empty out the store so I can  shop. I can't go to a bookstore. I can't drive a car. I can't use my credit cards or carry money.  If they ever find out I have that phone, they'll  probably pack me off to Outer Mongolia.  <p>     "You know what I miss, Lizzie? I miss going  out to the mailbox for my mail. I miss all those  catalogs I used to get by the pound. I always  looked forward to Sunday afternoon, when I'd  browse through them and order something.  You know what else? I made potato pancakes  one day. They came up here on the run and said  I was stinking up the White House and not to do  it again. They fucking told me I can't make  potato pancakes! It was the onion I put in them.  I'm not excusing my language either."  <p>     For all of a minute, Lizzie almost felt sorry for  her old friend. Almost. Then she burst out  laughing. "Remember that old saying, 'Be careful  what you wish for, because you just might get  it.' You wished for this, we made it happen for  you at the eleventh hour, and now you have to  live with it. And you have to honor your debt.  That's the bottom line."  <p>     "God, Lizzie, how cold you sound. That's the  real reason you agreed to sign on, isn't it?  You're here to protect your friends, and if it  means taking me down, you'll help them do it,  right?"  <p>     Lizzie just smiled.  <p>     "Goddamnit, Lizzie, say something."  <p>     "Where I come from, Marti, and where  you've been, a person is only as good as her  word. I really should be going. I've taken up  enough of your time today."  <p>     Martine Connor turned to stop her furious  pacing. Lizzie thought she looked great in a  honey-colored suit, with a copper-colored blouse  underneath her suit jacket, which was open. Her  haircut was stylish, and the feathery bangs  falling over her forehead were new, too, since  the last time Lizzie had seen Martine. She looked  presidential.  <p>     "But we haven't had dessert, and I was going  to give you the tour. Lizzie, I'm sorry. I'll find a  way. I promise you. Please, I need you to believe  me."  <p>     "It's not me you have to convince, Marti. I'll  pass on your message. Six months. Not one day,  not one hour, not one second longer. I'll report  in on January second. I hope you have a wonderful  holiday. Are you staying here or going  somewhere?"  <p>     "Camp David. I plan to sleep through the holidays.  Do you want to hear something really sad?  I don't have a single soul I can invite to spend  the holidays with me. Well, that's not quite true. I  had several people I was going to invite, but the  Service said when they vetted them, they were  unsuitable. <i>Unsuitable!</i> That's what they said. I'm  whining, and I didn't want to do that. I apologize."  <p>     Lizzie stepped forward and wrapped her arms  around the president. She squeezed hard. "Six  months, Marti," she whispered. "Now, how do I  get out of here? Is that guy with the 'football'  still outside the door? Oh, one last thing. Watch  out for Baron Bell."  <p>     Martine grimaced. "You mean the marine  with the nuclear codes? Yes, he's out there. You  just walk past him. It's that simple. One of my  agents will take you home."  <p>     Lizzie stared at the president. She could feel  her eyes start to burn at what she was seeing on  her old friend's face. She lowered her voice to a  bare whisper and said, "I wouldn't want to be  you for all the gold in Fort Knox."  <p>     The moment the door opened, Martine Connor  shed her personal persona and, in the blink  of an eye, was once again the president of the  United States. "Thank you for that observation,  and thank you for coming, Lizzie. I enjoyed our  luncheon. I hope we can do it again soon. Happy  holidays to you and <i>yours</i>."  <p>     "Don't eat too much turkey, Madam President."  Lizzie flinched at the sound of the door  closing behind her. She straightened her shoulders  and walked alongside the agent escorting  her to a black limousine, where another agent  waited to drive her back to her home.  <p>  <p>     Lizzie kept her eyes closed all the way home,  her mind racing as she sifted, collated, and  made mental notes.  <p>  <p>     The moment she was inside her cozy little  home, she shed her lavender suit and donned a  pair of jeans and a warm, fleecy shirt. She had  the crazy urge all of a sudden to make potato  pancakes. But first she had to check things at  her office, call her husband, then call the mountain.  Maybe she should call the mountain first.  Or maybe she should wait, think about her visit  some more, and make the potato pancakes first.  Multitasking, so to speak.  <p>     Before she did anything, though, she was  going to make herself a pot of strong black coffee  to get her adrenaline levels up. While the coffee  was dripping, Lizzie fiddled with her CD player,  then slipped in one of Cosmo's favorite CDs.  Frank Sinatra's mellow voice filled her kitchen.  She immediately felt the tenseness leave her  shoulders. Then she made herself a sandwich,  the kind of sandwich Cosmo raised his eyebrows  over but later admitted was tasty. Swiss cheese,  lettuce, fire-roasted peppers, and one slice of  salami. That mess she'd mangled back at the  White House couldn't come close to the sandwich  she was devouring. There wasn't a crumb to  be seen when she finished.  <p>     Then Lizzie moved at lightning speed. She  called the mountain, then she called Jack Emery,  then her office. She had two calls left to make  when she poured her coffee. The first call was  to Nikki's old law office, where she asked more  questions than she answered. She had one call  to go before she could call her husband. With  business taken care of, she could talk for  hours if he had the time. At the crack of dawn,  she'd be winging her way to Vegas to spend  Thanksgiving and the rest of the holidays with  Cosmo. A radiant smile lit her features.  <p>     Lizzie was huffing and puffing when she  opened the doors of the fireplace, placed the  logs just so, and threw in a pile of birch kindling.  The fire blazed instantly. She then moved  a pile of silky red cushions near the hearth so  she could curl up and be comfortable.  <p>  <p>     One more trip to the kitchen to replenish her  coffee. She was walking through the dining room  when retired judge Nellie Easter picked up the  phone. "Lizzie, Judge. Several things. I want to  wish you and Elias a wonderful Thanksgiving  and a Merry Christmas. I'm leaving in the morning  for Las Vegas." They made small talk for a  few minutes, with Lizzie asking about Elias's  new grandbaby and his other children before  she got down to the real reason for her phone  call.  <p>     "Nellie, tell me everything you know about  Baron Bell. And ask Elias if he knows anything.  Better yet, use the speakerphone, if he's agreeable."  <p>     "Baron was always a gentleman in court. He  fights to win for his clients. He and I belong to  five or six of the same organizations. He's been  Man of the Year for so many years, I've lost count.  He used to do a lot of pro bono work. Lovely  wife, kind of timid, stays in his shadow. Two  grown children. One is a doctor at Georgetown,  and one is a public defender in Georgia. Several  grandchildren, who he dotes on. No matter the  cause, you can count on him for a donation, and  he gives his time willingly to any worthy cause. He  plays Santa every year for some children's  group, and it always makes the paper. He always  arrives in a sleigh with his helpers, either on  wheels or with horses pulling the sleigh, and he  does it at his own expense. It's usually quite an  event. As far as I know, I never heard a hint of  any kind of scandal. He's quite wealthy, and as  you know, there are always a few who will take a  swipe at you for that. Elias said there's a file on  him at the Bureau, but nothing bad is in it.  There are those among the recipients of his  generosity who think he's the Messiah. Why are  you asking, Lizzie?"  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>  <p>     <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>Deadly Deals</b> by <b>FERN MICHAELS</b>  Copyright &copy; 2009   by Fern Michaels.
