He has stumbled forwards and backwards through time. He has been blown up, reassembled, cruelly imprisoned, horribly released, and colorfully insulted more than is strictly necessary. And of course Arthur Dent has comprehensively failed to grasp the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. <br> <br>Arthur has finally made it home to Earth, but that does not mean he has escaped his fate. <br><br>Arthur's chances of getting his hands on a decent cuppa have evaporated rapidly along with all the world's oceans. For no sooner has he touched down on the planet Earth than he finds out that it is about to be blown up . . . ..again.<br><br><i>And Another Thing</i>  . . .  is the rather unexpected, but very welcome, sixth installment of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. It features a pantheon of unemployed gods, everyone's favorite renegade Galactic President, a lovestruck green alien, an irritating computer, and at least one very large slab of cheese.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>At long last, the motley band from Douglas Adams's renowned five-book Hitchhiker's Guide Trilogy have returned, thanks to Artemis Fowl author Colfer. When the Vogons return to finish obliterating Earth in our universe and all alternatives, Arthur Dent and his companions find themselves hitchhiking on the spacefaring Viking longship of Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, an immortal with a death wish who is an expert at mass insults. Readers may find this volume paradoxical. On its own it is a funny novel, but Adams set a legendary, nearly impossible standard. Wacky humor reminiscent of the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy rings true, as do most of the characters, but newer elements, such as the brief appearance of Cthulhu, feel out of place. Most notably absent is the supreme inventiveness that hit us with the Infinite Improbability Drive, and the comic-sublime moments like Arthur flying with Fenchurch. You can't go home again, but Adams fans will still appreciate the reunion with old friends. <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

											Here is the sixth, and latest, installment in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy &quot;trilogy,&quot; created by Douglas Adams. It was also published with the approval of Adams' widow. <p/><p/>Arthur Dent has made his way back to Earth, but it isn't &quot;his&quot; Earth. The Vogons, with the extremely bad poetry, are working on destroying all possible versions of Earth, so Arthur must take off, again. Ford Prefect, writer for the Guide, and Zaphod Beeblebrox, former president of the Galaxy, are still around. Tricia McMillan is a former TV reporter who ran away with Zaphod, just before the Earth was destroyed. She changed her name to Trillian, and used some of Arthur's DNA to have Random, a daughter. Random is very smart, and has taken teenage surliness to new levels.<p/><p/>A small remnant of humanity has made its way to a planet called Nano, run by an Irish property developer named Hunter Hillman. He feels that the humans need a god to worship. The Norse God Thor is one of the applicants. A being named Wowbagger travels around the galaxy handing out insults on various planets. What follows is a titanic battle involving Wowbagger, Thor and a cheese-based deity.<p/><p/>For die-hard fans of the series, concerned that no one could do it like Adams, relax. Colfer is a veteran author who knows what he is doing, and it shows here. For those new to the series, read one or two of the early books first, and then read this. It's really worth reading.</p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Admirable Attempt But No...<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-1"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1381322_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781401323585_BK_1_1381322" href="#previewReview_1381322" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>May 09, 2010: 
											If I was to sum up the problems with &quot;And Another Thing...&quot; by comparing it to something else somewhere in modern pop culture I would not have to dig too deep for two simple words: Family Guy. The reason for such a bold statement is that like Family Guy, &quot;And Another Thing...&quot; suffers from a thin plot and a horrible tendency to diverge from linear storytelling to make odd side jokes that go nowhere in the form of Guide Notes. The original books had the occasional little excepts from the Guide but in this latest installment one can not go a couple of pages before running into a short except that I can only describe as pointless and a waste. Now I will admit I have to give a little leniency to Eoin Colfer (whom I have never heard of prior) for taking such a bold move as to filling in for the one and only Douglas Adams. The attempt was admirable but falls a bit flat. If you are interested in where Eoin Colfer leads our favorite characters then by all means please read the book. But if you are anywhere near a purist or just might be easily angered/annoyed by constant references to Eccentrica Gallumbits of Eroticon 6, the seamingly slow pace (compared to the originals' quick pace) or maybe Eoin's wildly different approach to poking fun at theology - this book might not be for you.</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35703936.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Eoin Colfer</p><p><strong>Also Known As:</strong><br>William Eoin Colfer (full name)</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Wexford Town, County Wexford, Republic of Ireland</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>May 14, 1965</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Waterford City, County Waterford, Republic of Ireland</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>Bachelor of Education, 1986; Education Diploma, 1987</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>British Children�s Book of the Year 2001; WHS Children�s Book Award, 2002; Irish World Literary Award, 2003; German Children�s Book of the Year, 2004</p><p><a class="left-arrow-small no-underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.eoincolfer.com">* Eoin Colfer's official web site</a></p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Biography</h3><p>Eoin Colfer is a former elementary school teacher whose Artemis Fowl series has become an international bestseller.

I would still love to write a comic one day."<p>    <b>"I have a real hatred of queues.</b> If I see a queue of more than four people, I will leave the building and come back another day."<p>    <b>"I have four brothers and they are the inspiration</b> for several of the sprites and gremlins in my books."<p>    <b>"I did a parachute jump recently</b> and loved it. I would definitely take it up as a hobby if we had more clear sky over here in Ireland." <p>    <b>"I am a big theatre fan,</b> and I go as often as possible with my wife. I actually started out in the theatre, writing plays for my actor friends."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b><br>  I remember being amazed by <I>Huckleberry Finn</I>. Huck was the original antihero, and I found it amazing that this less-than-perfect individual could so readily garner my sympathy. He was a bit like me, I suppose, a bit like most young boys -- mischievous and often up to no good, but his heart was in the right place. I think Huckleberry Finn is directly responsible for me creating Artemis -- an antihero of my own. <p>    <b>What are your ten favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Huckleberry Finn</I> by Mark Twain -- It made me realize that ordinary people were the real heroes. Also I loved the quirky first-person narrative.<p>    <li><I>The Princess Bride</I> by William Goldman -- One of the funniest books ever written, but a classic adventure tale at the same time. Anyone with aspirations to be a comic writer should have to read this.<p>    <li><I>Marathon Man</I> also by William Goldman -- My favorite thriller. Goldman's characters are so believable that you accept any plot twists he throws at you.<p>    <li><I>True History of the Kelly Gang</I> by Peter Carey -- A wonderful, authentic-sounding narrative where Carey succeeds at taking a highly intelligent character and making him sound uneducated. <p>    <li><I>Treasure Island</I> by Robert Louis Stephenson -- The classic pirate tale. Contains some of the most terrifying scenes I have ever read. The <I>tap-tap</I> of the blind beggar's cane as he searches for Jim, for instance. <p>    <li>The Mortdecai Trilogy</I> by Kyril Bonfiglioli -- A journalist friend recommended this to me, having read <I>Artemis Fowl</I>. When Artemis grows up, he could turn out like Charlie Mortdecai. A hilarious journey into the slightly dodgy world of the London antique dealer.<P>    <li><I>The White Trilogy</I> by Ken Bruen -- My favorite crime writer. Ken's books are gritty, hilarious, and tragic. Nobody gets a break. Ever. If it's happily-ever-after you want, give Ken a miss.<p>    <li><I>Star of the Sea</I> by Joseph O Connor -- The epic story of a famine ship's journey to the New World. Reading this makes me want to write historical fiction. A masterpiece that makes you forget that history is past.<p>    <li><I>A Star Called Henry</I> by Roddy Doyle -- A historical dramatic thriller, this really is difficult to put down. Doyle's writing makes you feel like you are right there beside his characters, watching their adventures.<p>    <li><I>Perfume</I> by Patrick Suskind -- One of those amazing books that comes out of nowhere and stops you in your tracks. The descriptive writing in this book is so exquisite that I got really depressed and resolved to try harder myself. A book about smells that is absolutely captivating.<p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Shakespeare in Love</I> -- One long, delicious word game. On the surface it is a beautiful love story, but there is also social commentary here and dozens of wonderful Shakespeare references that you get as you become more educated. Joseph Fiennes is magnificent.<p>    <li><I>The Silence of the Lambs</I> -- Loved the book. Loved the film. Anthony Hopkins is the best baddie ever. Ever! And that is what made the film.<p>    <li><I>Highlander</I> -- A beautifully shot fantasy film. A rarity, with a cleverer than usual plot. The action never lets up and the past is imaginatively interwoven with the present.<p>    <li><I>Adam and Paul</I> -- A low-budget Irish masterpiece that follows two Dublin down-and-outs around for 24 hours. Heartbreaking and hilarious. A clever sparse script and two masterful central performances hold this movie together.<p>    <li><I>Thunderball</I> -- My favorite Bond movie. This was the first movie I ever saw in a cinema -- albeit a makeshift sheet-on-the-wall cinema. I literally could not believe what I was seeing. A lifelong Bond fan was born.<p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I like all kinds of music, from classical to heavy rock. At the moment I have been listening to John Mayer a lot, and David Bowie. My brother is in a band called Salthouse, so they are always in the player too. If I am feeling a bit lethargic, I will put on something from AC/DC or Rush to wake myself up.<p>    <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  My book club would be for children, and we would be reading some of the classics, like <I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I> or <I>Ivanhoe</I>, to show the kids that there is more to literature than the latest thing.<p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I never give my own books as gifts, because I get them for free. I like to give books that I know the person likes, and if I can I get them signed. So at festivals I keep my friends in mind. A signed book is a great present, and I am always touched when I get one. One of the best presents I ever got was when Ken Bruen told me he was dedicating his next book to me.<p>     <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I always work in an office/shed in the bottom of my garden. I set myself up with the phone and a bottle of water and off I go. Not very exciting, I'm afraid. What I need, mostly, is peace and quiet.<p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  I was writing for years before I got the phone call from my first publisher. I remember the day clearly because I was holding my newborn son in one arm and taking the call at the same time. I got very excited and swung my boy high in the air. With a new baby and a publishing deal, it was a very good week for me. I was glad that I persevered and was not put off by the first 50 refusals.<p>    <b>If you could choose one new writer to be "discovered," who would it be?</b><br>  There is an Irish writer called Gerard Whelan who is working on a fantasy trilogy for teens. I think he could be the next big thing. I love him because his style is lyrical and exciting -- not an easy trick.<p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Once the book is written, approach getting published as a business project. There is nothing creative about finding an agent or publisher. Present your work clearly and cleanly, and make sure you send it to the right people. There is no point sending a western novel to a computer manuals publisher.<p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Like its subtitle, this book challenges us for an explanation. The unfurling of <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> series stopped with the untimely 2001 demise of its author, Douglas Adams. But so fertile an epic was not meant to cease. Eoin Colfer, the acclaimed writer of the Artemis Fowl children's book series, has answered the call to continue the saga in high style. "I am bloody determined," he insists, "that this will be the best thing I have ever written." <i>And Another Thing�</i> resumes the series where the fifth novel left off, with the meeting of Arthur and his long-lost daughter, Random.</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p><b>An Englishman's continuing search through space and time for a decent cup of tea . .</b><br><br>Arthur Dent's accidental association with that wholly remarkable book, <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, has not been entirely without incident.<br><br>Arthur has travelled the length breadth and depth of known, and unknown, space. He has stumbled forwards and backwards through time. He has been blown up, reassembled, cruelly imprisoned, horribly released, and colorfully insulted more than is strictly necessary. And of course Arthur Dent has comprehensively failed to grasp the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. <br> <br>Arthur has finally made it home to Earth, but that does not mean he has escaped his fate. <br><br>Arthur's chances of getting his hands on a decent cuppa have evaporated rapidly along with all the world's oceans. For no sooner has he touched down on the planet Earth than he finds out that it is about to be blown up . . . ..again.<br><br><i>And Another Thing</i>  . . .  is the rather unexpected, but very welcome, sixth installment of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. It features a pantheon of unemployed gods, everyone's favorite renegade Galactic President, a lovestruck green alien, an irritating computer, and at least one very large slab of cheese.
</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>At long last, the motley band from Douglas Adams's renowned five-book Hitchhiker's Guide Trilogy have returned, thanks to Artemis Fowl author Colfer. When the Vogons return to finish obliterating Earth in our universe and all alternatives, Arthur Dent and his companions find themselves hitchhiking on the spacefaring Viking longship of Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, an immortal with a death wish who is an expert at mass insults. Readers may find this volume paradoxical. On its own it is a funny novel, but Adams set a legendary, nearly impossible standard. Wacky humor reminiscent of the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy rings true, as do most of the characters, but newer elements, such as the brief appearance of Cthulhu, feel out of place. Most notably absent is the supreme inventiveness that hit us with the Infinite Improbability Drive, and the comic-sublime moments like Arthur flying with Fenchurch. You can't go home again, but Adams fans will still appreciate the reunion with old friends. <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This supposed truth is scoffed at by a clutch of Betelgeusean beat poets who claim to have moleskin pads older than that (rat a tat-tat). Seventeen billion, they say, at the very least, according to their copy of the Wham Bam Big Bang scrolls. A human teenage prodigy once called it at fourteen billion based on a complicated computation involving the density of moon rock and the distance between two pubescent females on an event horizon. One of the minor Asgardian gods did mumble that he'd read something somewhere about some sort of a major-ish cosmic event eighteen billion years ago, but no one pays much attention to pronouncements from on high anymore, not since the birth of the gods debacle, or Thorgate as it has come to be known.<br>However many billions it actually is, it is billions, and the old man on the beach looked as though he'd counted off at least one of those million millions on his fingers. His skin was ivory parchment, and viewed in profile he closely resembled a quavering uppercase S.<br>The man remembered having a cat once, if memories could be trusted as anything more than neuron configurations across trillions of synapses. Memories could not be touched with one's fingers. Could not be felt like the surf flowing over his gnarled toes could be felt. But then what were physical feelings but more electrical messages from the brain? Why believe in them either? Was there anything trustworthy in the Universe that one could hug and hold onto like a Hawaliusian wind staunch in the midst of a butterfly storm, apartfrom a Hawaliusian wind staunch.<br>Bloody butterflies, thought the man. Once they'd figured out the wing fluttering a continent away thing, millions of mischievous lepidoptera had banded together and turned malicious.<br>Surely that cannot be real, he thought. Butterfly storms?<br>But then more neurons poured across even more synapses and whispered of improbability theories. If a thing was bound never to happen, then that thing would resolutely refuse not to happen as soon as possible.<br>Butterfly storms. It was only a matter of time.<br>The old man wrenched his focus from this phenomenon before some other catastrophe occurred to him and began its rough slouch to be born.<br>Was there anything to trust? Anything to take comfort from?<br>The setting suns lit crescents on the wavelets, burnished the clouds, striped the palm leaves silver, and set the china pot on his veranda table twinkling.<br>Ah, yes, thought the old man. Tea. At the center of an uncertain and possibly illusory universe there would always be tea.<br>The old man traced two natural numbers in the sand with a walking stick fashioned from a discarded robot leg and watched as the waves washed them away.<br>One moment, there was forty-two and the next there wasn't.<br>Maybe the numbers were never there and perhaps they didn't even matter.<br>For some reason this made the old man cackle as he leaned into the incline and plodded to his veranda. He settled with much creaking of bone and wood into a wicker chair that was totally sympathetic to the surroundings, and called to his android to bring some biscuits.<br>The android brought Rich Tea.<br>Good choice.<br>Seconds later the sudden appearance of a hovering metal bird caused a momentary lapse in dunking concentration and the old man lost a large crescent of his biscuit to the tea.<br>"Oh, for heaven's sake," grumbled the man. "Do you know how long I have been working on that technique? Dunking and sandwiches. What else is left to a person?"<br>The bird was unperturbed.<br>"An unperturbed bird," said the old man softly, enjoying the sound of it. He closed the bad eye that hadn't worked properly since he'd fallen out of a tree as a giddy boy, and examined the creature.<br>The bird hovered, its metallic feathers shimmering crimson in the sun's rays, its wings beating up tiny maelstroms.<br>"Battery," it said in a voice that reminded the old man of an actor he had once seen playing Othello at London's Globe Theatre. Amazing what you can get from the tone of a single word.<br>"You did say battery?" said the man, just to confirm. It could possibly have been flattery, or even hattery. His hearing was not what it used to be, especially on initial consonants.<br>"Battery," said the bird again, and suddenly reality cracked and fell to pieces like a shattered mirror. The beach disappeared, the waves froze, crackled, and evaporated. The last thing to go was the Rich Tea.<br>"Bugger," muttered the old man as the final crumbs dissipated on his fingertips, then he sat back on a cushion in the room of sky that suddenly surrounded him. Someone would be coming soon, he was sure of it. From the dim caverns of his old memories, the names Ford and Prefect emerged like gray bats to associate themselves with the impending disaster.<br>Whenever the Universe fell apart, Ford Prefect was never far behind. Him and that accursed book of his. What was it called? Oh, yes. The Pitchforker's Pride Is a Fallacy.<br>That, or something very close to it.<br>The old man knew exactly what Ford Prefect would say.<br>Look on the bright side, old mate. At least you're not lying down in front of a bulldozer, eh? At least we're not being flushed out of a Vogon air lock. A room of sky is not too shabby, as it happens. It could be worse, a lot worse.<br>"It will be a lot worse," said the old man with gloomy certainty. In his experience, things generally got worse, and on the rare occasion when things actually seemed to get better, it was only as a dramatic prelude to a cataclysmic worsening.<br>Oh, this room of sky seemed harmless enough, but what terrors lurked beyond its rippling walls? None that were not terrible, of that the old man was certain.<br>He poked a finger into one of the wall's yielding surfaces and was reminded of tapioca pudding, which almost made the old man smile, until he remembered that he had hated tapioca ever since a bullying head boy had filled his slippers with the stuff back in Eaton House Prep.<br>"Blisters Smyth, you sneaky shit," he whispered.<br>His fingertip left a momentary hole in the clouds, and through it the old man caught a glimpse of a double-height sash window beyond, and outside the window, could that be a death ray?<br>The old man rather feared that it was.<br>All this time, he thought. All this time and nothing has happened.<br><br>Ford Prefect was living the dream. Providing the dream included residence in one of Han Wavel's ultraluxury, five-supergiant-rated, naturally eroded hedonistic resorts, filling one's waking hours with permanent damage amounts of exotic cocktails, and liaisons with exotic females of various species.<br>And the best bit: The expense of this whole self-indulgent and possibly life-shortening package would be taken care of by his Dine-O-Charge card, which had no credit limit thanks to a little creative computer tinkering on his last visit to the Hitchhiker's Guide offices.<br>If a younger Ford Prefect had been handed a blank page and asked to, in his own time, write a short paragraph detailing his dearest wishes for his own future, the only word he might have amended in the above was the adverb possibly. Probably.<br>The resorts of Han Wavel were so obscenely luxurious that it was said a Brequindan male would sell his mother for a night in the Sandcastle Hotel's infamous vibro-suite. This is not as shocking as it sounds, as parents are accepted currency on Brequinda and a nicely moisturized septuagenarian with a good set of teeth can be traded for a mid-range family moto-carriage.<br>Ford would perhaps not have sold either parent to finance his sojourn at the Sandcastle, but there was a bicranial cousin who was often more trouble than he was worth.<br>Every night, Ford rode the fleshevator to his penthouse, croaked at the door to grant him entry, then made time to look himself in the bloodshot eyes before passing out facedown in the basin.<br>This is the last night, he swore nightly. Surely my body will revolt and collapse in on itself.<br>What would his obituary say in the Hitchhiker's Guide? Ford wondered. It would be brief, that was for sure. A couple of words. Perhaps the same two words he had used to describe Earth all those years ago.<br>Mostly harmless.<br>Earth. Hadn't something rather sad happened on Earth that he should be thinking about? Why were there some things he could remember and others that were about as clear as a hazy morning on the permanently fogbound Misty Plains of Nephologia?<br>It was generally at about this maudlin stage that the third Gargle Blaster squeezed the last drop of consciousness from Ford's overjuiced brain and he would giggle twice, squawk like a rodeo chicken, and execute a near perfect forward tumble into the nearest bathroom receptacle.<br><br>And yet every morning when he lifted his head from the en suite basin (if he was lucky), Ford found himself miraculously revitalized. No hangover, no dragon breath, not even a burst blood vessel in either sclera to bear witness to the previous night's excesses.<br>"You are a froody dude, Ford Prefect," he invariably told himself. "Yes, you are."<br>There is something fishy going on here, his rarely-heard-from subconscious insisted.<br>Fishy?<br>So long and thanks for all the<br>Wasn't there something about dolphins? Not fish, true, but they inhabited the same...habitat.<br>Think, you idiot! Think! You should be dead a hundred times over. You have consumed enough cocktails to pickle not only yourself but several alternate versions of yourself. How are you still alive?<br>"Alive and froody," Ford would say, often winking at himself in the mirror, marveling at how lustrous his red hair had become. How pronounced his cheekbones. And he seemed to be growing a chin. An actual chiseled chin.<br>"This place is doing me good," he told his reflection. "All the photo-leech wraps and the irradiated colono-lemming treatments are really boosting my system. I think I owe it to Ford Prefect to stay another while."<br>And so he did.<br><br>On the last day, Ford charged an underwater massage to his credit card. The masseur was a Damogranian pom-pom squid with eleven tentacles and a thousand suckers that pummeled Ford's back and cleaned out his pores with a series of whiplash tapotement moves. Pom-pom squids were generally hugely overqualified for their work in the spa industry, but were tempted away from their umpteenth doctorates by the lure of high salaries, plankton-rich pools, and the chance of massaging a talent scout for the music industry and maybe getting themselves a record deal.<br>"Have you done any talent scouting, friend?" asked the squid, though he didn't sound hopeful.<br>"Nope," replied Ford, bubbles streaming from his Plexiglas helmet, face shining orange in the pleasant glow of rock phosphorescence. "Though I once owned a pair of blue suede shoes, which should count for something. I still own one; the other is closer to mauve, due to it being a copy."<br>The squid nipped at passing plankton as he spoke, which made conversation a little disjointed.<br>"I don't know if..."<br>"If what?"<br>"I hadn't finished."<br>"It's just that you stopped speaking."<br>"There was a glint. I thought it was lunch."<br>"You eat glints?"<br>"No. Not actual glints."<br>"Good, because glints are baby gloonts, and they're poisonous."<br>"I know. I was merely saying that..."<br>"More glints?"<br>"Precisely. You're sure you're not a talent scout then, or an agent?"<br>"Nope."<br>"Oh, for Zark's sake," swore the squid, a little unprofessionally. "Two years I've worked here. Talent scouts and agents coming out of your suckers...they promised. Not one. Not bloody one. I was studying advanced kazoo, you know."<br>Ford couldn't resist a lead-in like that. "Advanced kazoo? How advanced can kazoo studies be?"<br>The squid was wounded. "Pretty advanced when you can play a thousand of them at the same time. I was in a quartet. Can you imagine?"<br>Ford gave it a go. He closed his eyes, enjoyed the whup-pop of the suckers on his back, and imagined four thousand kazoos playing in perfect subaquatic harmony.<br>Sometime later the squid enveloped Ford in half a dozen tentacles and gently flipped him over. Ford opened one eye to read the squid's badge.<br>I am Barzoo, read the tag. Use me as you will.<br><br>Excerpted from AND ANOTHER THING . . .  by EOIN COLFER. Copyright (c) 2009 EOIN COLFER.
