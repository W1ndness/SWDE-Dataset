			Bargain</li></ul></div></div><h3>Synopsis</h3><p><p>Venice--a city of masks and riddles, where narrow streets and passageways form a giant maze that confounds the uninitiated and deepens the sense of mystery. As captivating as it is elusive, the city teeters in precarious balance between endurance and decay. Architectural treasures crumble--foundations shift, ornaments fall--even as efforts to preserve them are under way. In <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>, John Berendt, author of the record-breaking bestseller <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>, unveils the enigmatic Venice as only he can. <p>The story opens on the evening of January 29, 1996, when a sensational fire destroys the historic Fenice Opera House...</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Jonathan Yardley</h3><p><i>The City of Falling Angels</i> , Berendt's inquiry into people, places and aspects of Venice that tourists almost never see, doesn't have as strong a narrative line as Midnight , and no one in it is quite so hilariously and engagingly outr� as Lady Chablis, the Savannah drag queen, but the story of the Fenice fire and its aftermath is exceptionally interesting, the cast of characters is suitably various and flamboyant, and Berendt's prose, now as then, is precise, evocative and witty.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>John Berendt, author of the bestsellers <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I> and <I>The City of Falling Angels</I>, told us about his former life in the fast-paced magazine world, which he likened to "standing in a stream trying to catch fish with your bare hands."

											This was a great introduction to Venice before my first trip to Venice. Gives a glimps of Venice beyond the tourist guide books. As I read this book I felt I could see what Berendt was wrtiing about. Once I arrived in Venice I had a sense of deja vu. I traveled to Venice with two friends and they also read the book. They felt the same as I did. A trip to Venice would not be complete without reading this as well as the standard guide books.</p><p><strong>I Also Recommend: </strong><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Venetian-Affair/Andrea-Di-Robilant/e/9780375726170/?pv=y">A Venetian Affair</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/No-Vulgar-Hotel/Judith-Martin/e/9780393330601/?pv=y">No Vulgar Hotel</a>, <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Lucia/Andrea-Di-Robilant/e/9781400095117/?pv=y">Lucia</a>. </p></div><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>A Real Page Turner<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-4"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1351588_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9780641858628_BK_2_1351588" href="#previewReview_1351588" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>April 08, 2010:

"I encourage them, they make good copy."  <p>  They do indeed, if Berendt is writing about them. His first book, <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I>, which Berendt has called "a nonfiction novel," could be classified as a true crime story, or a travelogue, but it's also an absorbing collection of crazy people, cranks, eccentrics and oddballs, whose lives Berendt chronicles with as much detail as he devotes to murder suspect Jim Williams, ostensibly his main character.  <p>  As readers and critics have noted, the true "main character" of <I>Midnight in the Garden</I> is the city of Savannah, Ga., which enjoyed a tremendous boost in tourism as a result of what Savannahians now refer to simply as "the book."  <p>  Berendt started visiting Savannah in the early 1980s, flying in from New York, where he worked as a writer at <I>Esquire</I>. "All I did the first year," he later said in the <I>London Daily Telegraph</I>, "was take notes and interview, because I knew, the longer I was there, the less strange the whole thing would seem."  <p>  For Berendt, who once edited <I>New York</I> magazine, Savannah may have seemed strange at first, but in a fascinating way. As he explained in an <I>Entertainment Weekly</I> interview, "People in Savannah don't say, 'Before leaving the room, Mrs. Jones put on her coat.' Instead, they say, 'Before leaving the room, Mrs. Jones put on the coat that her third husband gave her before he shot himself in the head.'"  <p>  After gathering facts, gossiping with the locals and getting to know the city, Berendt shaped his experiences into a work <I>Kirkus Reviews</I> called "stylish, brilliant, hilarious, and coolhearted." <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I> spent a record-setting four years on the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller list and sold 2.7 million copies in hardcover.  <p>  Not everyone adored it, however. In a controversy that perhaps anticipated author James Frey's troubles in the publishing world, some journalists wondered whether Berendt's embellishments were too numerous and substantial for the book to hold up as nonfiction. The book included an author's note explaining that Berendt changed the sequence of some events in the narrative.  <p>  <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I> became a fixture on bestseller lists and was made into a movie directed by Clint Eastwood. Some of the real people profiled in the book became minor celebrities in their own right -- most notably Berendt's drag-queen friend Lady Chablis, who played herself in the movie and later published an autobiography.  <p>  Readers wondered what Berendt would do for an encore, but the author was relatively slow to oblige them. It wasn't until more than ten years after the publication of his first book that Berendt released <I>The City of Falling Angels</I>, a portrait of Venice as experienced not by tourists, but by its year-round residents, who turn out to be as eccentric and weirdly compelling as the Savannahians of <I>Midnight in the Garden</I>. ("The man whose palazzo features three space suits and a stuffed monkey is par for the course," noted Janet Maslin in <I>The New York Times Book Review</I>.)  <p>  Though some critics thought Berendt's second book lacked the narrative pull of his first, many agreed that, as <I>Washington Post</I> critic Jonathan Yardley put it, "The story of the Fenice fire and its aftermath is exceptionally interesting, the cast of characters is suitably various and flamboyant, and Berendt's prose, now as then, is precise, evocative and witty."  <p>  As Ann Godoff, Berendt's editor (first at Random House and now at Penguin Press), explained it, "By no means is this the same book. But nobody else could have written them both."  <p></p><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><I>Some fun and fascinating outtakes from our interview with Behrendt: </I> <p>  <b>"I never use an alarm clock. I have an internal mechanism</b> that wakes me up when I want to wake up. I'm not sure how I developed this ability, or what its significance is. Anyhow, I always fall asleep secure in the knowledge that I will wake up within ten minutes of the desired time. And I always do. <p>    <b>"When I'm writing, I like to gain distance from my work</b> so I can tell how it will strike a reader who is seeing it for the first time. I do this through a trick I devised while I was living in Savannah writing <I>Midnight</I> -- I would call my apartment in New York, the answering machine would pick up, I'd read the page of text I'd just written, then I'd hang up. A minute later, I'd call my apartment again and listen to the "message." Hearing my own voice reading the page over the phone -- my voice having traveled 1800 miles (900 each way ) -- gave me just the detached perspective I needed. <p>    "On occasion, while I was working on <I>Falling Angels</I>, I used the same technique, ridiculous though it may sound; in this case the calls were from Venice to New York rather than from Savannah. Gay Talese says he achieves a similar detachment by tacking pages to the opposite wall and then reading them through binoculars. Whatever works."<p>              <b>"I had an early start in the world of books. I was hired at the age of fourteen</b> as a stock boy at the Economy Book Store in downtown Syracuse. It was my first job. I worked after school every day for four hours and made ten dollars a week." <p>        <b>"I stay fit by exercising daily on a treadmill or a stationary bicycle</b> for close to an hour. I'd be bored out of my mind doing this if it weren't for the fact that I watch movies at the same time.  That way, time flies. I call it my Treadmill and Bicycle Film Festival. I've found that if I'm watching a thriller, my pace ratchets up a notch."  <p>    <b>"My number-one hobby, my preferred means of unwinding</b>, and my most often-used route of escape are all the same: reading. Nothing takes me out of myself faster or more completely than a good read. It relieves stress, lifts me out of a funk, and makes me feel I'm doing something worthwhile. <p></p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the Fall of 2005, John Berendt took some time out to tell us about some of his favorite books, authors, and interests:</I> <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life or your career as a writer?</b>  I could cite any number of great classics that, when I first read them, introduced me to the excitement of books, but the book that meant the most to me is not at all well known and is now out of print. <p>    It's <I>Small World</I> a novel published in 1951 by Simon & Schuster. The story concerns a family of four living in upstate New York. It's charming and beautifully written. Carol Deschere, the author, happens to be my mother, and the family depicted in her novel closely resembles our own. The book sold about 2,000 copies and, although my mother never wrote another book, <I>Small World</I> was a life-changing experience for me, because in addition to making me enormously proud of her, it showed me for the first time how real life could be transformed into words and stories and published in a book for all to read. It also planted the first seed in my mind that I might become a writer one day. <p>    <b>re ten your favorite books, and what makes them special to you?</b><br>  I wouldn't know how to start listing my ten favorite books, since that's not the way I think of books, or of anything else for that matter. Clifton Fadiman once edited a collection of pieces, fiction and nonfiction, entitled <I>Reading I've Liked</I>. So, I'm going to call the following list, "Books I've Liked":<p>    <li><I>Nicholas Nickleby</I> by Charles Dickens -- The experience of reading Dickens has been a lifelong pleasure. I go from book to book and back again. Of all Dickens's novels, Nicholas Nickleby has a special standing with me, because it was the first one I read to myself. I was deeply impressed, at the age of twelve, by the squalid boys school Dotheboys Hall, run by the horrid Wackford Squeers and his wretched wife, who force-feeds the boys a miserable breakfast of brimstone and treacle, all from the same too-large wooden spoon, then calls a curly-headed child to come forward so that she can wipe her hands in his hair. That scene and that book propelled me into years of reading Dickens.   <p>    <li><I>Collected Stories</I> by Tennessee Williams -- This is a book I've given as a gift countless times, usually when I've discovered that someone hasn't read it or hasn't even heard of it. Tennessee Williams's plays have overshadowed his short stories, and small wonder, but these forty-nine stories span most of his life from the age of sixteen until the very end. As Gore Vidal points out in his affectionate and informative introduction, the collected stories are "the true memoir of Tennessee Williams. Whatever happened to him, real or imagined, is here." <p>    The stories are about love, longing and loneliness, and they are flavored with a connoisseur's taste for the loony and the bizarre. On occasion, the glimmer of a future work flashes by, like the line in Williams's haunting "The Mysteries of the Joy Rio" that reads, "But the sweet bird of youth had flown from Pablo Gonzales, leaving him rather sad..." For me, the best of the stories is the fiendish "Desire and the Black Masseur," but there are a good many runners-up.  <p>    <li><I>The Age of Innocence</I>by Edith Wharton -- The wistful regret of having made the wrong decision in life and realized it too late makes this book as heart-wrenchingly relevant today as it was eighty-five years ago. And Wharton's writing style is just as fresh and durable. <p>    I commend to anyone, for example, her astonishing 165-word description of the doyenne of New York society, Mrs. Manson Mingott, beginning with the words, "The immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle life like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump active little woman with a neatly-turned foot and ankle into something as vast and august as a natural phenomenon. She had accepted this submergence as philosophically as all her other trials, and now, in extreme old age, was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost unwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh, in the center of which the traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation...."  Wharton was a master in the art of prose portraiture.  <P>        <li><I>In Patagonia</I> by Bruce Chatwin -- This is travel writing at its best. As a boy, Chatwin was fascinated by a dried-up piece of skin and hair, said to be from a brontosaurus brought back from Patagonia by a distant cousin. Chatwin's musings about the brontosaurus eventually led to a trek through Patagonia described in ninety-seven brief chapters filled with sharp observations and crystal-clear prose. They are gem-like entries in a brilliant diary. The narrative meanders, just as Chatwin did on his journey. Passages describing the stark landscape are side-by-side with profiles of people encountered, nuggets of historical lore, and the details of rugged overland travel. Readers who insist on a traditional narrative thread might be disappointed, even put off.  But for me, Chatwin evokes a serene curiosity that I found captivating.  <P>    <li><I>The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor</I> -- Flannery O'Connor is simply the best.  She enshrines in each of her characters an unforgettable rendition of a basic human flaw: venality, bigotry, pent-up anger, stupidity, jealousy, greed, even innocence. Her dark humor is funniest when she is laying bare some horrible piece of human nastiness. And the writing! She can evoke more from the particulars of a person's face than any other writer I know.  For example: <p>     "His face behind the windshield was sour and froglike; it looked like it had a shout closed up in it, it looked like one of those closet doors in gangster pictures where there is somebody tied to a chair behind it with a towel in his mouth." ("The Heart of the Park")<p>    "He heard the words drag out � �Well, the way I see it, men elect....' He felt them pull out of his mouth like freight cars, jangling, backing up on each other, grating to a halt, sliding, clinching back, jarring, and then suddenly stopping as roughly as they had begun." ("The Barber")<p>    "His neck was thrust forward as if he were trying to smell something that was always being drawn away." ("The Peeler")<p>    "She jumped back and looked as if she were going to swallow her face." ("The Peeler")<p>    "Besides the neutral expression that she wore when she was alone, Mrs. Freeman had two others, forward and reverse, that she used for all her human dealings. Her forward expression was steady and driving like the advance of a heavy truck. Her eyes never swerved to the left or right but turned as the story turned as if they followed a yellow line down the center of it. She seldom used the other expression because it was not often necessary for her to retract a statement, but when she did, her face came to a complete stop. ("Good Country People")<p>    If I were forced to pick my one Flannery O'Connor story above all others, I'd resist, but if pressed I'd say, "Well, okay: 'Revelation.' If you've never read any of her stories, start with that one, and if you aren't compelled to read all the others afterwards, then you'll never have to take my word about anything ever again." <p>    <li><I>Neuromancer</I> by Williams Gibson -- Gibson is the man who invented the term "cyberspace," and this is the book that launched the digital science-fiction genre back in 1984, long before the Internet existed as we know it now. This dark, fast-paced novel is a visionary masterpiece. It's populated by hackers and cyberpunks, Gibson's creations that have since become fixtures in the electronic matrix. I was given the book in the mid-1990s, when the Internet was beginning to wrap itself around all of us, and I read it with increasing excitement -- and not without some difficulty. Gibson doesn't bother to explain his terms or lead the reader by the hand through the puzzling dislocations of his futuristic landscape. <I>Neuromancer</I> is pulp fiction, but it's guided by a hip wisdom about a baffling phenomenon that was only beginning to take shape.    <p>    <li><I>The Alexandria Quartet</I> by Lawrence Durrell -- I read these four books in my late teens and early twenties, which may have had something to do with my having been swept away by them -- by the sheer poetry of the writing, the sensuous atmosphere of Alexandria, the sexual tension, and above all the mystery and ambiguity.  <p>    <li><I>Where I'm Calling From</I> by Raymond Carver -- Carver's stories were a revelation to me when I encountered them for the first time in the early 1980s. His spare, minimalist style serves as a writer's manual for how to get more out of less. In a sentence, or even just a phrase, Carver establishes the mood, the nature of his characters and their predicament. He gives us clues instead of paragraphs of description or lengthy dialogue. I often put people on to Carver, especially when they've shown me something they've written that needs drastic paring down. Carver had something original to show the rest of us, and his early death is a real tragedy. My own copy of this collection (thirty stories arranged chronologically by the date they were written) is well worn.  <p>    <li><I>The Aspern Papers</I> by Henry James -- This psychological thriller is a Jamesian masterpiece and also one of his most accessible novels. It's about ambition, deception, invasion of privacy, and the shameless exploitation of the past. "You publishing scoundrel!" the ancient Juliana Bordereau shouts at the narrator when she catches him rifling through her effects in search of her love letters. James based this exquisite tale on a true story about Claire Clairmont, the former mistress of Lord Byron and mother of his illegitimate daughter, Allegra. Ms. Clairmont, living in Florence in extreme old age, was set upon by an unscrupulous American scholar hoping to lay his hands on her love letters from Bryon. In fictionalizing the story and moving it to Venice, James enriched the it and heightened its dramatic appeal immeasurably.  <p>    <li><I>The Magic Christian</I> by Terry Southern -- I include this quirky novel in my list, because it is a satiric gem and one of the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. Terry Southern was a comic genius (<I>Dr. Strangelove</I>, <I>Candy</I>) who has never really been given his due. The argument of <I>The Magic Christian</I> is a simple one, namely: There is no limit to what you can make people do, given enough money. Everyone has his price. In this slim volume, Southern illustrates his point in a story that becomes increasingly bizarre and culminates in one of the most outrageous scenes in the entire American literary canon.  <p>    <b>What are some of your favorite films, and what makes them unforgettable to you?</b><br>  <li><I>Kind Hearts and Coronets</I> -- Alec Guinness playing eight members of the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family -- male and female, each one dottier than the next -- is a supreme comic tour de force that always delights me. But then I have a soft spot for Guinness.  His Ealing Studio comedies -- <I>The Lady Killers</I>, <I>The Lavender Hill Mob</I>, <I>The Man in the White Suit</I> -- serve up a world of understated British humor that I've always found gently reassuring.  <p>    <li><I>Juliet of the Spirits</I>, directed by Federico Fellini -- I have a weakness for Fellini's fantasies. The music of Nina Rota has a lot to do with the spell this picture casts.<p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  At home, when I listen to music, it's usually jazz. However, when I'm writing I can't listen to any music at all, because the rhythm of the music interferes with the rhythm and flow of the syllables, sentences, and paragraphs. Rhythm is as important to me as the choice of words. It often determines the choice, in fact. Sometimes when I've written a sentence that says precisely what I want it to say with exactly the right words, it still needs an extra syllable or two at a certain place.  Ezra Pound once said that it's easy to imitate another writer's style, but it's impossible to imitate his rhythm.  <p>         <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading?</b><br>  <I>The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror</I>, by Bernard Lewis. This is an even-handed discussion of one of the most confounding issues facing the world today. Most of us are dangerously ignorant about Islam and terrorism and have no way of distinguishing between them.  Lewis offers a corrective. <p>    <b>What are your favorite kinds of books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>  I get the greatest pleasure giving books that I've read and enjoyed, because it means I'm not just giving someone a physical book but a reading experience that I've sampled and approved. It becomes a shared experience. Naturally that's the kind of book I like to receive, too. More than half the books I read are books people have recommended to me -- word of mouth. Well, my approach to gift-giving is word of mouth with the actual book thrown in. <p>    <b>Do you have any special writing rituals? For example, what do you have on your desk when you're writing?</b><br>  I like to write at a fairly clean desk, but I'm almost never able to do it. I put all my research into loose-leaf notebooks, arranged by topic, character and story, and I line them up on a shelf. That may sound very organized, but somehow it doesn't prevent loose papers from accumulating on my desk anyway, forming heaps and piles over and under the books, magazines, newspapers, pamphlets and jotted-down notes that somehow make their way to my desk despite my efforts to keep them under control.  <p>    <b>Many writers are hardly "overnight success" stories. How long did it take for you to get where you are today? Any rejection-slip horror stories or inspirational anecdotes?</b><br>  By the time I decided to write my first book, I had already had a productive, 25-year-long career as a magazine editor and columnist. After graduating from college, where I had been an editor of the <I>Harvard Lampoon</I>, I was hired as an editor by <I>Esquire</I>. Later, I served as the editor of <I>New York</I> magazine and then wrote a monthly column for <I>Esquire</I>. As much as I enjoyed working for magazines, I never had the time to delve deeply into any subject.  I'd work on a column or an article for a month or two and then move on to another topic. I was skimming the surface, and ultimately it was unsatisfying. So, in 1985, while supporting myself with my column and other freelance writing, I moved to Savannah, Georgia and started working on the book that turned out to be <I>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</I>.<p>      My rejection-slip horror story is a very unusual one. I wrote <I>Midnight</I> under my own steam, without a contract, because I didn't want to be held to a deadline and owe a publisher a book or its money back. After seven years, I was finished. I sent the manuscript to my agent, who was one of the better-known agents in New York, and to my surprise, she turned it down. My agent, mind you -- not a publisher. She sent it back to me with a note saying it was "too local" and that she doubted any publisher would want to take a chance on it "in this market," whatever that meant. <p>    The rejection did not upset me as much as it might have, because as an experienced editor I knew the book was at least publishable. So I gave the manuscript to another agent, who read it, loved it, and sent copies to five publishing houses, giving them three days to read it and make an offer if they wanted it. All five submitted bids, and I ended up signing a contract with Random House. I occasionally run into my former agent in New York, and I am cordial. I have no reason not to be. The way things turned out, I'm lucky she rejected it.<p>    <b>What tips or advice do you have for writers still looking to be discovered?</b><br>  Keep a diary, but don't just list all the things you did during the day. Pick one incident and write it up as a brief vignette. Give it color, include quotes and dialogue, shape it like a story with a beginning, middle and end -- as if it were a short story or an episode in a novel. It's great practice.  Do this while figuring out what you want to write a book about. The book may even emerge from within this running diary.  <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From Barnes &amp; Noble</h3><p>Venice, city of masks, city of mystery. After the success of <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,</i> author John Berendt searched for another city, another subject. He chose the island city of Venice; in his words, "uniquely beautiful�isolated geographically and emotionally�inward-looking�.steeped in tradition." When he arrived in 1996, the city was almost smoldering in controversy: Just three days before, La Fenice, its historic opera house, had gone up in flames, and this city of canals was awash in rumors and accusations about the fire's cause. As Berendt immersed himself in Venetian culture, he learned that secrets and quarrels were seldom far beneath the surface. In <i>City of Falling Angels,</i> he reveals Venice as a festering hive of eccentrics, connivers, and provocateurs; a mazelike city where mysteries unfold upon mysteries and where even murder is a matter of opinion.
</p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>The author of <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i> returns after more than a decade to give us an intimate look at the "magic, mystery, and decadence" of the city of Venice and its inhabitants<p>It was seven years ago that <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i> achieved a record-breaking four-year run on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list. John Berendt's inimitable brand of nonfiction brought the dark mystique of Savannah so startlingly to life for millions of people that tourism to Savannah increased by 46 percent. It is Berendt and only Berendt who can capture Venice-a city of masks, a city of riddles, where the narrow, meandering passageways form a giant maze, confounding all who have not grown up wandering into its depths. Venice, a city steeped in a thousand years of history, art and architecture, teeters in precarious balance between endurance and decay. Its architectural treasures crumble--foundations shift, marble ornaments fall--even as efforts to preserve them are underway. <i>The City of Falling Angels</i> opens on the evening of January 29, 1996, when a dramatic fire destroys the historic Fenice opera house. The loss of the Fenice, where five of Verdi's operas premiered, is a catastrophe for Venetians. Arriving in Venice three days after the fire, Berendt becomes a kind of detective-inquiring into the nature of life in this remarkable museum-city-while gradually revealing the truth about the fire. In the course of his investigations, Berendt introduces us to a rich cast of characters: a prominent Venetian poet whose shocking "suicide" prompts his skeptical friends to pursue a murder suspect on their own; the first family of American expatriates that loses possession of the family palace after four generations of ownership; an organization of high-society, partygoing Americans who raise money to preserve the art and architecture of Venice, while quarreling in public among themselves, questioning one another's motives and drawing startled Venetians into the fray; a contemporary Venetian surrealist painter and outrageous provocateur; the master glassblower of Venice; and numerous others-stool pigeons, scapegoats, hustlers, sleepwalkers, believers in Martians, the Plant Man, the Rat Man, and Henry James.</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Jonathan Yardley</h3><p><i>The City of Falling Angels</i> , Berendt's inquiry into people, places and aspects of Venice that tourists almost never see, doesn't have as strong a narrative line as Midnight , and no one in it is quite so hilariously and engagingly outr� as Lady Chablis, the Savannah drag queen, but the story of the Fenice fire and its aftermath is exceptionally interesting, the cast of characters is suitably various and flamboyant, and Berendt's prose, now as then, is precise, evocative and witty.</p><h3>The New York Times - 
								Janet Maslin</h3><p>Mr. Berendt fills his new book with wily figures like the pigeon hunters. But he much prefers the ones trying to bag bigger game. In an interlocking set of stories loosely gathered around the investigation of a spectacular fire, he describes all manner of bizarre patricians and clever parasites, real artists and con artists, annual Carnival participants and those who stay in costume all year round, all united in cherishing Venice's melancholy grandeur. He seeks out the ineffably, aristocratically strange. The man whose palazzo features three space suits and a stuffed monkey is par for the course.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Berendt reads his own nonfiction exploration of the seamy side  of Venice with an insider's hushed tones, chronicling the life  and times of the city's movers and shakers like a naughty child  sharing an overheard secret. Following up his similar study of  Savannah in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Berendt has  cobbled together a series of entertaining tales of the legendary  canal city, ranging from the squabbles of Venetian fund-raisers  to the fire in the Venice Opera House. Like a cocktail-party  raconteur with a particularly juicy story to tell, Berendt  twists his listeners' ears with his book's seamless string of  Venice-themed misbehavior and decadence. Only occasionally  overemoting, Berendt mostly maintains the proper tone of  high-society gossip delivered succinctly. Berendt's intimate  voice helps to tie together the disparate strands of his  sometimes-sprawling book. Simultaneous release with the Random  House hardcover (Reviews, July 18). (Sept.)

</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>More than ten years after the publication of Midnight in the  Garden of Good and Evil, Berendt returns with another nonfiction  thriller, this one set in Venice. The victim here is the Fenice,  Venice's spectacular opera house, which burned under mysterious  circumstances three days before Berendt's arrival in early 1996.  As the author settles in for an extended stay, the Venetians  attempt to determine the cause of the fire and rebuild the opera  house-a process that reveals much about the life of the city and  its citizens. Berendt meets Venetians of all classes and  occupations, as well as tourists and expatriates, and weaves  their stories into his chronicle of the fire investigation and  reconstruction process. The cast of distinctive characters  includes a judge, a glassblower, artists and artisans, poets,  scholars, contractors, socialites, and members of the  aristocracy. Even the buildings of Venice are characters in this  real-life drama; thankfully, appendixes listing main characters,  places, and organizations help readers to keep track of  everything. What emerges is an intimate portrait of a city that  has survived floods, government corruption, decay, rising water  levels, invasions, and attempts by international organizations  to "save" it-all while remaining a bastion of art and a place of  unique beauty. Essential. [See Prepub Alert, LJ 6/15/05.]-Rita  Simmons, Sterling Heights P.L., MI    Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.
</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>An intriguing tour of mysterious Venice and its most fascinating residents, centered around a 1996 fire that destroyed the city's historic opera house. Venice may be sinking, but in Berendt's capable hands, the city has never seemed more colorful, perplexing and alluring. The story focuses on the destruction by fire in 1996 of the famed Fenice Opera House, where Verdi first unveiled Rigoletto and La Traviata. Berendt, best known for 1995's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, decides to take an apartment to record the drama that ensues. What follows is part police drama, part cultural tour, with many pauses for comic relief along the way. While visiting some of Venice's ornate palazzos and their aristrocratic inhabitants, we encounter characters like the chameleon-like Mario Moro, whose wardrobe includes a different official uniform for every day of the week, and Massimo Donadon, "The Rat King of Treviso." Eventually, two electricians are charged with torching the Fenice, but as is customary in Venice, the whole truth seems to lie hidden in the city's dimly lit alleyways and winding canals. Berendt also finds intrigue in unexpected quarters. We follow a vicious boardroom feud that ignites within Save Venice, an international fundraising group formed to help restore the city's old buildings and artworks. We also encounter Philip and Jane Rylands, caretakers of Ezra Pound's aged companion of 50 years, Olga Rudge, who are later accused of exploiting the woman's senility in a bid for Pound's Venice cottage and private papers. With the exception of the occasional wrong turn (Berendt lingers far too long over the apparent suicide of a local gay artist, for example), this is an engagingjourney in which the author navigates Venice's shadowy politics, its tangled bureaucracy and its elegant high-society nightlife with a discerning, sanguine touch. Berendt does great justice to an exalted city that has rightly fascinated the likes of Henry James, Robert Browning and many filmmakers throughout the world.

As it happened, the timing of my visit was purely coincidental. I had made plans, months before, to come to Venice for a few weeks in the off-season in order to enjoy the city without the crush of other tourists.</p> <p> "If there had been a wind Monday night," the water-taxi driver told me as we came across the lagoon from the airport, "there wouldn't be a Venice to come to."</p> <p> "How did it happen?" I asked.</p> <p> The taxi driver shrugged. "How do all these things happen?"</p> <p> It was early February, in the middle of the peaceful lull that settles over Venice every year between New Year's Day and Carnival. The tourists had gone, and in their absence the Venice they inhabited had all but closed down. Hotel lobbies and souvenir shops stood virtually empty. Gondolas lay tethered to poles and covered in blue tarpaulin. Unbought copies of the International Herald Tribune remained on newsstand racks all day, and pigeons abandoned sparse pickings in St. Mark's Square to scavenge for crumbs in other parts of the city.</p> <p> Meanwhile the other Venice, the one inhabited by Venetians, was as busy as ever-the neighborhood shops, the vegetable stands, the fish markets, the wine bars. For these few weeks, Venetians could stride through their city without having to squeeze past dense clusters of slow-moving tourists. The city breathed, its pulse quickened. Venetians had Venice all to themselves.</p> <p> But the atmosphere was subdued. People spoke in hushed, dazed tones of the sort one hears when there has been a sudden death in the family. The subject was oneveryone's lips. Within days I had heard about it in such detail I felt as if I had been there myself.</p> <P> IT HAPPENED ON MONDAY EVENING, January 29, 1996.</p> <p> Shortly before nine o'clock, Archimede Seguso sat down at the dinner table and unfolded his napkin. Before joining him, his wife went into the living room to lower the curtains, which was her long-standing evening ritual. Signora Seguso knew very well that no one could see in through the windows, but it was her way of enfolding her family in a domestic embrace. The Segusos lived on the third floor of Ca' Capello, a sixteenth-century house in the heart of Venice. A narrow canal wrapped around two sides of the building before flowing into the Grand Canal a short distance away.</p> <p> Signor Seguso waited patiently at the table. He was eighty-six-tall, thin, his posture still erect. A fringe of wispy white hair and flaring eyebrows gave him the look of a kindly sorcerer, full of wonder and surprise. He had an animated face and sparkling eyes that captivated everyone who met him. If you happened to be in his presence for any length of time, however, your eye would eventually be drawn to his hands.</p> <p> They were large, muscular hands, the hands of an artisan whose work demanded physical strength. For seventy-five years, Signor Seguso had stood in front of a blazing-hot glassworks furnace-ten, twelve, eighteen hours a day-holding a heavy steel pipe in his hands, turning it to prevent the dollop of molten glass at the other end from drooping to one side or the other, pausing to blow into it to inflate the glass, then laying it across his workbench, still turning it with his left hand while, with a pair of tongs in his right hand, pulling, pinching, and coaxing the glass into the shape of graceful vases, bowls, and goblets.</p> <p> After all those years of turning the steel pipe hour after hour, Signor Seguso's left hand had molded itself around the pipe until it became permanently cupped, as if the pipe were always in it. His cupped hand was the proud mark of his craft, and this was why the artist who painted his portrait some years ago had taken particular care to show the curve in his left hand.</p> <p> Men in the Seguso family had been glassmakers since the fourteenth century. Archimede was the twenty-first generation and one of the greatest of them all. He could sculpt heavy pieces out of solid glass and blow vases so thin and fragile they could barely be touched. He was the first glassmaker ever to see his work honored with an exhibition in the Doge's Palace in St. Mark's Square. Tiffany sold his pieces in its Fifth Avenue store.</p> <p> Archimede Seguso had been making glass since the age of eleven, and by the time he was twenty, he had earned the nickname "Mago del Fuoco" (Wizard of Fire). He no longer had the stamina to stand in front of a hot and howling furnace eighteen hours a day, but he worked every day nonetheless, and with undiminished pleasure. On this particular day, in fact, he had risen at his usual hour of 4&#58;30 A.M., convinced as always that the pieces he was about to make would be more beautiful than any he had ever made before.</p> <p> In the living room, Signora Seguso paused to look out the window before lowering the curtain. She noticed that the air had become hazy, and she mused aloud that a winter fog had set in. In response, Signor Seguso remarked from the other room that it must have come in very quickly, because he had seen the quarter moon in a clear sky only a few minutes before.</p> <p> The living room window looked across a small canal at the back of the Fenice Opera House, thirty feet away. Rising above it in the distance, some one hundred yards away, the theater's grand entrance wing appeared to be shrouded in mist. Just as she started to lower the curtain, Signora Seguso saw a flash. She thought it was lightning. Then she saw another flash, and this time she knew it was fire.</p> <p> "Papa!" she cried out. "The Fenice is on fire!"</p> <p> Signor Seguso came quickly to the window. More flames flickered at the front of the theater, illuminating what Signora Seguso had thought was mist but had in fact been smoke. She rushed to the telephone and dialed 115 for the fire brigade. Signor Seguso went into his bedroom and stood at the corner window, which was even closer to the Fenice than the living room window.</p> <p> Between the fire and the Segusos' house lay a jumble of buildings that constituted the Fenice. The part on fire was farthest away, the chaste neoclassical entrance wing with its formal reception rooms, known collectively as the Apollonian rooms. Then came the main body of the theater with its elaborately rococo auditorium, and finally the vast backstage area. Flaring out from both sides of the auditorium and the backstage were clusters of smaller, interconnected buildings like the one that housed the scenery workshop immediately across the narrow canal from Signor Seguso.</p> <p> Signora Seguso could not get through to the fire brigade, so she dialed 112 for the police.</p> <p> The enormity of what was happening outside his window stunned Signor Seguso. The Gran Teatro La Fenice was one of the splendors of Venice; it was arguably the most beautiful opera house in the world, and one of the most significant. The Fenice had commissioned dozens of operas that had premiered on its stage-Verdi's La Traviata and Rigoletto, Igor Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, Benjamin Britten's The Turn of the Screw. For two hundred years, audiences had delighted in the sumptuous clarity of the Fenice's acoustics, the magnificence of its five tiers of gilt-encrusted boxes, and the baroque fantasy of it all. Signor and Signora Seguso had always taken a box for the season, and over the years they had been given increasingly desirable locations until they finally found themselves next to the royal box.</p> <p> Signora Seguso had no luck getting through to the police either, and now she was becoming frantic. She called upstairs to the apartment where her son Gino lived with his wife and their son, Antonio. Gino was still out at the Seguso glass factory in Murano. Antonio was visiting a friend near the Rialto.</p> <p> Signor Seguso stood silently at his bedroom window, watching as the flames raced across the entire top floor of the entrance wing. He knew that, for all its storied loveliness, the Fenice was at this moment an enormous pile of exquisite kindling. Inside a thick shell of Istrian stone lined with brick, the structure was made entirely of wood-wooden beams, wooden floors, wooden walls-richly embellished with wood carvings, sculpted stucco, and papier-m�ch�, all of it covered with layer upon layer of lacquer and gilt. Signor Seguso was aware, too, that the scenery workshop just across the canal from his house was stocked with solvents and, most worrisome of all, cylinders of propane gas that were used for welding and soldering.</p> <p> Signora Seguso came back into the room to say she had finally spoken with the police.</p> <p> "They already knew about the fire," she said. "They told me we should leave the house at once." She looked over her husband's shoulder and stifled a scream; the flames had moved closer in the short time she had been away from the window. They were now advancing through the four smaller reception halls toward the main body of the theater, in their direction.</p> <p> Archimede Seguso stared into the fire with an appraising eye. He opened the window, and a gust of bitter-cold air rushed in. The wind was blowing to the southwest. The Segusos were due west of the theater, however, and Signor Seguso calculated that if the wind did not change direction or pick up strength, the fire would advance toward the other side of the Fenice rather than in their direction.</p> <p> "Now, Nandina," he said softly, "stay calm. We're not in any danger."</p> <p> The Segusos' house was only one of many buildings close to the Fenice. Except for Campo San Fantin, a small plaza at the front of the theater, the Fenice was hemmed in by old and equally flammable buildings, many of them attached to it or separated from it by only four or five feet. This was not at all unusual in Venice, where building space had always been at a premium. Seen from above, Venice resembled a jigsaw puzzle of terra-cotta rooftops. Passages between some of the buildings were so narrow one could not walk through them with an open umbrella. It had become a specialty of Venetian burglars to escape from the scene of a crime by leaping from roof to roof. If the fire in the Fenice were able to make the same sort of leap, it would almost certainly destroy a sizable swath of Venice.</p> <p> The Fenice itself was dark. It had been closed five months for renovations and was due to reopen in a month. The canal along its rear fa�ade was also closed-empty-having been sealed off and drained so work crews could dredge the silt and sludge from it and repair its walls for the first time in forty years. The canal between the Segusos' building and the back of the Fenice was now a deep, muddy gulch with a tangle of exposed pipes and a few pieces of heavy machinery sitting in puddles at the bottom. The empty canal would make it impossible for fireboats to reach the Fenice, and, worse than that, it would deprive them of a source of water. Venetian firemen depended on water pumped directly from the canals to put out fires. The city had no system of fire hydrants.</p> <P> THE FENICE WAS NOW RINGED BY A TUMULT OF SHOUTS and running footsteps. Tenants, routed from their houses by the police, crossed paths with patrons coming out of the Ristorante Antico Martini. A dozen bewildered guests rolled suitcases out of the Hotel La Fenice, asking directions to the Hotel Saturnia, where they had been told to go. Into their midst, a wild-eyed woman wearing only a nightgown came stumbling from her house into Campo San Fantin screaming hysterically. She threw herself to the ground in front of the theater, flailing her arms and rolling on the pavement. Several waiters came out of the Antico Martini and led her inside.</p> <p> Two fireboats managed to navigate to a water-filled canal a short distance from the Fenice. Their hoses were not long enough to reach around the intervening buildings, however, so the firemen dragged them through the kitchen window at the back of the Antico Martini and out through the dining room into Campo San Fantin. They aimed their nozzles at flames burning furiously in a top-floor window of the theater, but the water pressure was too low. The arc of water barely reached the windowsill. The fire went on leaping and taunting and sucking up great turbulent currents of air that set the flames snapping like brilliant red sails in a violent wind.</p> <p> Several policemen struggled with the massive front door of the Fenice, but to no avail. One of them drew his pistol and fired three shots at the lock. The door opened. Two firemen rushed in and disappeared into a dense white wall of smoke. Moments later they came running out. "It's too late," said one. "It's burning like straw."</p> <p> The wail of sirens now filled the air as police and firemen raced up and down the Grand Canal in motorboats, spanking up huge butterfly wings of spray as they bounced through the wakes of other boats. About an hour after the first alarm, the city's big fire launch pulled up at the landing stage behind Haig's Bar. Its high-powered rigs would at last be able to pump water the two hundred yards from the Grand Canal to the Fenice. Dozens of firemen ran hoses from the fire launch into Campo Santa Maria del Giglio, feverishly coupling sections together, but it was immediately apparent that the hoses were of different gauges. Leaks sprayed from the couplings, but the firemen carried the linked hoses, such as they were, up to the rooftops around the Fenice anyway. They directed half the water onto the theater in an attempt to contain the fire and the rest of it onto adjacent buildings. Fire Commandant Alfio Pini had already made a momentous strategic decision&#58; The Fenice was lost; save the city.</p> <P> WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, Count Girolamo Marcello was midsentence in a conversation over dinner with his son on the top floor of his palace less than a minute's walk from the front of the Fenice. Earlier in the day, Count Marcello had learned that the exiled Russian poet and Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky had died suddenly of a heart attack, at fifty-five, in New York. Brodsky had been a passionate lover of Venice and a friend and houseguest of Marcello's. It was while he was staying in Marcello's palace, in fact, that Brodsky had written his last book, Watermark, a lyrical reflection on Venice. That afternoon Marcello had spoken by phone with Brodsky's widow, Maria, and they had discussed the possibility of burying Brodsky in Venice. Marcello knew that this would not be easily arranged. Every available plot on the burial island of San Michele had been spoken for years ago. It was generally understood that any new arrival, even a native Venetian, would be dug up in ten years and moved to a common burial site farther out in the lagoon. But for a non-Venetian, Jewish atheist, gaining approval for even a temporary burial would be a quest fraught with obstacles. Still, there had been notable exceptions. Igor Stravinsky had been buried on San Michele, and so had Sergei Diaghilev and Ezra Pound. They had all been buried in the Anglican and Greek Orthodox section, and all would be allowed to remain there in perpetuity. So there was reason to hope that Brodsky could be buried there, too, and this was on Marcello's mind when the lights went out.</p> <p> Father and son sat in darkness for a while, expecting the lights to come back on. Then they heard the sirens, lots of them, many more than usual.</p> <p> "Let's go up and see what's happened," said Marcello. They headed upstairs to the wooden deck on the roof, the altana, and as soon as they opened the door, they saw the raging fire.</p> <p> Marcello decided they should leave the house at once. They descended the stairs, feeling their way in the darkness, Marcello wondering if the six-hundred-year-old palace was doomed. If it was, the most impressive private library in Venice would disappear with it. Marcello's library occupied most of the second floor. It was an architectural delight, a high-ceilinged space complete with a wraparound wooden gallery that could be reached only by climbing a secret stairway hidden behind a panel in the wall. The floor-to-ceiling shelves held forty thousand volumes of private and state papers, some of them more than a thousand years old. The collection amounted to a treasure trove of Venetian history, and Marcello regularly made it available to scholars. He himself spent long hours sitting in a thronelike black leather armchair perusing the archives, especially the papers of the Marcello family, which was one of the oldest in Venice. Marcello's ancestors included a fifteenth-century doge, or head of state. The Marcellos had, in fact, been among the families that built the Fenice and owned it until just before World War II, when the municipality of Venice took it over.</p> <p> Marcello walked to the edge of Campo San Fantin and found himself standing in the midst of a crowd that included the entire city council, which had rushed in a body from Ca' Farsetti, the town hall, where it had been in an evening session. Marcello was a familiar figure around town, with his bald head and close-cropped gray beard. The press frequently sought him out for comment, knowing they could count on a frank, often provocative quote or two. He had once described himself to an interviewer as "inquisitive, restless, eclectic, impulsive and capricious." It was the last two of these behavioral quirks that asserted themselves as he stood in Campo San Fantin looking at the burning opera house.</p> <p> "What a shame," he said. "It's gone. I suppose I will never see it again. The reconstruction will take so long, I'm sure I won't be alive when it's finished." This remark was nominally directed to the person next to him, but it was really intended for the ears of a handsome man with a dark beard in his mid-fifties who was standing a few feet away&#58; the mayor of Venice, Massimo Cacciari. Mayor Cacciari was a former Communist, a professor of philosophy and architecture at the University of Venice, and Italy's most highly regarded contemporary philosopher. Being mayor automatically made him president of the Fenice, which meant he had been responsible for the security of the theater and would now be in charge of rebuilding it. Marcello's remark clearly implied that, in his opinion, neither Cacciari nor his left-wing government had the competence to do it. Mayor Cacciari gazed at the fire with a look of deep despair, unfazed one way or the other by Marcello's obliquely worded taunt.</p> <p> "But I would suggest," Marcello went on, "that if they want to rebuild the place as it was in its prime-and by that I mean as a social place, a meeting place-they should make it into a great discotheque for young people."</p> <p> An old man standing in front of Marcello turned around, aghast, tears rolling down his cheeks. "Girolamo!" he said. "How can you say such a thing? Anyway, who knows what the hell young people will want five years from now?"</p> <p> A deafening crash resounded in the depths of the Fenice. The great crystal chandelier had fallen to the floor.</p> <p> "You have a point," Marcello replied, "but, as everybody knows, going to the opera has always been a social thing. You can even see it in the architecture. Only a third of the seats are positioned so they have a good view of the stage. The rest, particularly the boxes, are really best for looking at the audience. The arrangement is purely social."</p> <p> Marcello spoke with a gentle bemusement and without any trace of cynicism. It seemed to tickle him that anyone could think that generations of operagoers, like the Marcellos, had been drawn to the opera by anything as lofty as music or culture-Benedetto Marcello, the eighteenth-century composer and one of Girolamo Marcello's forebears, notwithstanding. Throughout its existence, the Fenice had been hallowed ground in the social landscape of Venice, and Girolamo Marcello had a broad knowledge of Venetian social history. He was, in fact, regarded as something of an authority on the subject.</p> <p> "In the old days," he said, "the private boxes had curtains you could close, even during the performance. My grandfather loved going to the opera, but he didn't give a damn about music. He would open the curtains only for highlights on the stage. He would say, 'Silence! Now we have the aria!' and he would pull open the curtains and applaud . . . 'Good! Lovely! Well done!' Then he would close the curtains again, and a servant would come from the house with a basket of chicken and some wine. Opera was just a form of relaxation, and anyway it was cheaper to take a box at the opera than heat a whole palace for an evening."</p> <p> Suddenly another enormous boom shook the ground. The floors in the entrance wing had collapsed, one onto another. People standing at the edge of the campo leaped backward just as the roof of the entrance wing fell, sending flames and burning debris high into the air. Marcello went back upstairs to his rooftop altana, this time fortified with a bottle of grappa, a video camera, and a bucket of water in case any of the airborne embers should happen to land on his roof.</p> <p> Within minutes-as Girolamo Marcello's video camera whirred and clicked, as Archimede Seguso stared in silence from his bedroom window, as hundreds of Venetians watched from rooftops, and as thousands more all over Italy followed live television coverage of the fire-the roof of the auditorium collapsed with a thunderous boom and a volcanic eruption that shot flaming debris 150 feet into the air. A powerful updraft sent chunks of burning embers, some as big as shoe boxes, arcing over Venice like comets.</p> <p> Shortly after eleven, a helicopter appeared above St. Mark's, swung low over the mouth of Grand Canal, and scooped up a tankful of water. Then it soared aloft again, banked over the Fenice and, to cheers from rooftops, dropped its water. A hissing plume of steam and smoke coiled up from the Fenice, but the fire kept burning undiminished. The helicopter turned and flew back to the Grand Canal to load up again.</p> <p> It suddenly occurred to Girolamo Marcello that his wife, Lesa, who was out of town, might hear about the fire before he had a chance to tell her that her family and her house were safe. He came down from the roof to telephone her.</p> <p> Countess Marcello worked for Save Venice, the American nonprofit organization devoted to raising money for restoring Venetian art and architecture. Save Venice was headquartered in New York. Lesa Marcello was the director of its Venice office. Over the past thirty years, Save Venice had restored scores of paintings, frescoes, mosaics, statues, ceilings, and building fa�ades. Recently, Save Venice had restored the Fenice's painted curtain, at a cost of $100,000.</p> <p> Save Venice had become a hugely popular charity in America, largely because it was set up to be, in a sense, a participatory charity. Save Venice would organize event-filled, four-day galas in Venice in late summer during which, for three thousand dollars a person, subscribers could attend elegant lunches, dinners, and balls in private villas and palaces not open to the public.</p> <p> In winter Save Venice kept the spirit alive by mounting a fund-raising ball in New York. Lesa Marcello had flown to New York earlier in the week to attend the winter ball. This year it was to be a masked ball, based on the theme of Carnival, and it would be held in the Rainbow Room on the sixty-fifth floor of Rockefeller Center. As he picked up the telephone to call his wife, Girolamo Marcello suddenly remembered that the ball was scheduled for this very night.</p> <p> --from The City of Falling Angels by John Berendt, Copyright &copy; 2005 John Berendt, published by The Penguin Press, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc., all rights reserved, reprinted with permission from the publisher.
