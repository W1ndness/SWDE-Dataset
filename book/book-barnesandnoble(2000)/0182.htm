			Bargain</li></ul></div></div><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>In <i>The Rest of Her Life</i>, Laura Moriarty delivers a luminous, compassionate, and provocative look at how mothers and daughters with the best intentions can be blind to the harm they do to one another.<br><br>Leigh is the mother of high-achieving, popular high school senior Kara. Their relationship is already strained for reasons Leigh does not fully understand when, in a moment of carelessness, Kara makes a mistake that ends in tragedy -- the effects of which not only divide Leigh's family, but polarize the entire community. We see the story from Leigh's perspective, as she grapples with the hard reality of what her daughter has done and the devastating consequences her actions have on the family of another teenage girl in town, all while struggling to protect Kara in the face of rising public outcry.<br><br>Like the best works of Jane Hamilton, Jodi Picoult, and Alice Sebold, Laura Moriarty's The Rest of Her Life is a novel of complex moral dilemma, filled with nuanced characters and a page-turning plot that makes readers ask themselves, "What would I do?"
</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
												Donna Rifkind</h3><p>Like Kate DiCamillo's <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i> and Sue Monk Kidd's <i>The Secret Life of Bees,</i> Laura Moriarty's first novel, <i>The Center of Everything</i>, owed its success to the immense likability of a young female protagonist. Mixing just the right combination of solemnity and cheer, Moriarty turned a potentially sappy coming-of-age tale into a full-on charmer with the voice of her 10-year-old narrator, Evelyn Bucknow of Kerrville, Kan., who courageously traversed a hard-luck childhood without any false moves. In her second novel, the author has achieved an even more impressive goal, inspiring compassion for a character unblessed with Evelyn's immediate appeal&#8230;Moriarty's novel shows that it is not literature's job to be uplifting, or even to be beautiful. It is literature's job to say yes, to every corner of every life: yes to disaffected characters like Leigh as well as to winsome ones like Evelyn Bucknow; yes to grief as much as to solace; yes to wrongdoers as well as to the wronged; and yes most of all to "our weak attempts," as Leigh acknowledges, "to feel each other's burdens."</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_6" onclick="javascript:openTab('edreviews')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Reviews and Recommendations</a></strong><h3>Biography</h3><p>Named one of the writers to watch in <I>Book</I> magazine's special "Newcomers" issue, Laura Moriarty is quickly becoming known as a literary superstar as her debut novel <I>The Center of Everything</i> draws acclaim.</p><strong style="display: block;"><a name="moreAboutAuthorContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('meet')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More About the Author</a></strong></div></div><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap6"><h3>Customer Reviews</h3><ul class="reviewBox"><li class="first">Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget " id="9781437659047_BK"><span class="avg-3h section_updateRating"></span></span></li><li>Ratings: 32<span id="numReviews">Reviews: 14</span></li><li><a name="seeAllReviewsContentTrigger" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-All-Reviews">See All Reviews</a></li><li><p class="writeReview"><strong><a name="writeReview_OverviewTab" class="section_writeReview" rel="nofollow" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-Write-A-Review" href="http://my.barnesandnoble.com/communityportal/WriteReview.aspx?EAN=9781437659047"></a></strong></p></li></ul><div class="newReviewDetails"><h4>Great Book!!<em>by Anonymous</em></h4><p>Reader Rating: <span class="rating-widget ignore"><span class="cust-5"></span></span><br><a name="previewReview_1402819_Trigger" class="reviewOverlay dropdownIcon byReviewID" id="9781437659047_BK_1_1402819" href="#previewReview_1402819" data-cmelementid="OverviewTab-See-Detailed-Ratings">See Detailed Ratings</a></p><p>June 10, 2010:

											'The Rest of Her Life' by Laura Moriarty was definitely an eye-opener for me.  I am in my twenties and am often texting or calling while driving.  The fact that the story is based on an 18-year-old accidentally killing someone with her car is very realistic.  Unfortunately, just recently near my hometown, a 17-year-old boy struck and killed a 50-year-old man while driving.  The boy was speeding, and apparently not watching the road, and struck the man while he was standing looking at a vehicle for sale.  This book made me look at the situation differently than I would have.  It definitely gave me the chance to step back and ask myself, &quot;What would I do?&quot; I also ask myself, &quot;What can I do to prevent it from happening?&quot;</p></div><p><br><a name="moreReviewsContentTrigger_7" onclick="javascript:openTab('custreview')" href="#TABS" class="left-arrow-small">More Customer Reviews</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-tracks" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-meet" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Fact File</h3><img src="http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/35700000/35704052.JPG" alt="" height="145" width="110"><p><strong>Name:</strong><br>Laura Moriarty</p><p><strong>Current Home:</strong><br>Maine</p><p><strong>Date of Birth:</strong><br>December 24, 1979</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong><br>Honolulu, Hawaii</p><p><strong>Education:</strong><br>B.S.W., University of Kansas, 1993; M.A. in English, University of Kansas, 2000</p><p><strong>Awards:</strong><br>George Bennett Fellowship for Creative Writing, Phillips Exeter Academy, 2000-2001</p></div></div><div class="poc-two-thirds"><div class="wrap5"><h3>Good to Know</h3><p><i>In our interview, Moriarty shared some fun, fascinating facts about herself</i>: <p>    <b>"There are other Laura Moriartys</b> I shouldn't be confused with: Laura Moriarty the poet, and Laura Moriarty the crime writer. If it helps, I'm Laura Eugenia Moriarty, though I've never used my middle name professionally."<p>    <b>"I got my first job when I was sixteen</b>, cooking burgers at McDonald's. I've been a vegetarian since I was ten, so it was a little hard on me. I'm also technically inept and kind of dreamy, so I frustrated the guy who worked the toaster to the point where he threatened to strangle me on a daily basis. I kept that job for two years. I gave Evelyn a job at McDonald's too, and I made her similarly unsuccessful." <p>    <b>"Another job I was really bad at was tending bar</b>. I was an exchange student at the University of Malta about ten years ago. I thought I wanted to go to medical school, so I signed up to take all these organic chemistry and physiology classes. In Malta. It was terrible. The Maltese students were <I>into</I> chemistry. I had a lab partner named Ester Carbone. There was a rumor my instructor had his house built in the shape of a benzene molecule. I couldn't keep up. I dropped out in February, and I needed money. Malta has pretty strict employment laws, and the only job I could get was an illegal one, working at a bar. I don't know anything about mixed drinks, and I don't speak Maltese. I think I was supposed to stand behind the bar be American and female and smile, but I ended up squinting at people a lot, so eventually, I was in the back, doing dishes. That was the year I started writing." <p>       <b>"<I>The Center of Everything</I> has a few autobiographical moments</b>, but not many. I grew up with three sisters in Montana. When you say you're from Montana, people get this wistful look in their eyes. I think they've seen too many Brad Pitt movies. I saw <I>A River Runs Through It</I>, which is set in my hometown, Bozeman. That movie drove me nuts: I don't think anyone is even wearing coat in the whole movie. They can't keep filming up there in August and tricking everyone. Of course, now I live in Maine." <p>         <b>"I have tender hands, and the worst thing in the world</b>, for me, is going to an event that requires a lot of hand shaking. Some people shake nicely, but some people have a death grip, and it's really painful. The thing is, you can't tell who's going to be a death gripper and who isn't.  Big, strapping men have shaken my hand gently, but an elderly woman I met last month almost brought me to my knees. She was smiling the whole time. I went to a hand shaking event a month ago, and I went along with the shaking, because I didn't want to look rude or standoffish or freaky about germs. But hand shaking just kills me. I'm not sure what to do about it. I went back to Phillips Exeter a month ago, and a very polite student reintroduced himself to me and extended his hand to shake. I actually tried to high five him. He looked at me like I was a crazy person. My sister told me I should take a cue from Bob Dole and carry a pen in my right hand all the time, so I might try that."</p><h3>Feature Interview</h3><I>In the summer of 2003, Laura Moriarty took some time out to talk with us about her favorite books, authors, and interests</I>. <p>    <b>What was the book that most influenced your life -- and why?</b><br>    It's difficult to pick just one, of course. But I will say that while I was writing <I>The Center of Everything</I>, I read Carl Sagan's <I>The Demon Haunted World</I>, and it made a strong impression on me. I only knew about Sagan from watching the Nova Channel when I was a kid, but I happened upon an essay he'd written before he died. I was so impressed I went to the library and checked out some of his books. In <I>The Demon Haunted World</I>, Sagan stresses the importance of skepticism and rational reasoning when considering the mysteries of the universe. It's easy for us today to see the insanity of the witchcraft trials, but Sagan gives a sympathetic account of how frightening the world must have seemed in those times, and how quickly our ability to reason can be dismissed in the face of fear and superstition. Today, Sagan points out, we have crop circles, alien abductions, and religious fundamentalism; the book has a great chapter called "The Baloney Detection Kit," an important tool for any open-minded skeptic. What I like most about Sagan is that he seems skeptical without coming across as cynical. He looks at the vastness of the universe and the intricacy of the natural world with so much wonder and awe, and he's able to translate it to a reader who isn't a scientist, such as myself. I also noticed how he refrains from making fun or putting down his opponents; there's such a generosity of spirit in his writing. I tried to put a bit of Sagan in Evelyn, the narrator of <I>The Center of Everything</I>.  <p>       <b>What are your ten favorite books -- and what makes them special to you?</b><br>    <li><I>Alias Grace</I> by Margaret Atwood -- This book recounts an actual murder that took place over a hundred years ago in a small town outside of Toronto. The narrator is the alleged murderess, an Irish immigrant servant girl. I listened to this book on audiotape, and I liked it so much I went out and got the book and read that too. The narrator has one of the most haunting voices I've ever come across.  <p>    <li><I>Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl</I> -- I read somewhere that Anne Frank's diary was the best selling book of all time, not including the Bible. I don't know if that's true or not, but I know I'm one of millions who feel fortunate to have read her words. I've reread the Diary many times over the years, and it's a different book for me with each new reading. I first read it when I was thirteen, and at that time, it introduced me to the cruelty of the Holocaust, to the extent that I could comprehend it at the time. But when I read it again a few years ago, it was an entirely different book for me. I was more aware of the difficult relationship she had with her mother, and how she struggled against the way others perceived her. When I read the Diary again recently, I saw the brilliance in her writing - her eye for details, and the way she conveys character with just a few brief lines of dialogue. I am certain that if the Franks would have emigrated to America and Anne would have grown up in the suburbs, she would still would have been an important writer.  <p>     <li><I>This Boy's Life</I> by Tobias Wolff -- I really like memoirs, especially when they're honest, when the writer refuses to let his story fall into comfortable, familiar patterns. Wolff survived a brutal upbringing with a sadistic stepfather, and so on some levels, the book is a story about survival in the face of emotional and physical abuse. But my favorite passages in the book are ones when Wolff takes a hard look at himself as an adolescent and admits to feelings and urges that a less courageous writer might have omitted. He chooses honesty over neat endings. His prose is beautiful, too. <p>    <li><I>Me Talk Pretty One Day</I> by David Sedaris -- Sedaris is hilarious, first and foremost. His stories are so funny that they could get by just on being funny, but often, once I stop laughing and think about them, I realize there's more going on. When I taught English at UNH, I read his story about his brother, "You Can't Kill the Rooster" to my students. I thought it was a great example of how alive writing could be. They weren't used to laughing that much in English class. I think a lesser writer might have been satisfied with turning an essay about his brother into one of the funniest character sketches of all time, but Sedaris's narrative also has so much respect and warmth in it. <p>    <li><I>Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China</I> by Jung Chang -- This book is non-fiction, an account of three generations of Chinese women.  The grandmother was a concubine with bound feet; the mother was a soldier in the Red Army, and the daughter, who wrote the book, lives in London today. <I>Wild Swans</I> gives a personal account of the misery of the Cultural Revolution and the insanity of life under Mao. It's a big book, full of details and sad stories. I assigned it when I was teaching at the University of Kansas, and some students practically rioted because they hated having to read such a long book about China. But some students loved it just as much as I did. <I>Wild Swans</I> reminds me that people have the capacity to create immense misery, but we also have the capacity to survive it. <p>    <li><I>A Map of the World</I> by Jane Hamilton -- I read this book years ago, and I remember I liked it very much. But just recently, I was lying in bed, trying to sleep, and for some reason I thought of it, and I thought about the plot, and it hit me all of a sudden that it was a great book. It's as if it took me that long to realize it. <I>A Map of the World</I> is about a school nurse, Alice, living a mildly frustrating life in a small town with her family; she's kind of happy, and she kind of isn't. But then two very bad things happen: the child of a close friend drowns while under Alice's supervision; months later, she's falsely accused of sexual abuse by a vengeful parent at the school where she works. She's sent to jail, and many of her former neighbors think the worst of her. So while Alice is plagued with guilt for something she did do, she's also attacked by others for something she didn't do. I think guilt is a really interesting concept for a writer to work with, and Hamilton does it so well. The prison scenes are amazing. <p>    <li><I>The Hours</I> by Michael Cunningham -- This book takes a sympathetic look at people who choose to commit suicide; ironically, it's one of the most life affirming books I've ever read. The characters have real struggles -- AIDS, mental illness, grief -- but at the end of the book, I felt I had been asked to look at life a little more carefully to see the beauty in it, even in its most difficult moments. And it's such a short book! I'm always impressed with authors who can convey so much in relatively few pages. <p>    <li><I>The Great Gatsby</I> by F. Scott Fitzgerald -- This novel is structurally perfect. As if that weren't enough, there's the lush, beautiful prose -- the fresh green breast of the New World and all that. And Nick is my favorite kind of narrator. Like Ishmael in <I>Moby Dick</I>, he's a side character observing the downfall of someone larger than life. <p>        <li><I>At Home in the World: A Memoir</I> by Joyce Maynard -- I was pretty skeptical when I checked out this book. All I knew about Maynard was that she had had an affair with J. D. Salinger in her youth, and she recently attempted to sell his old love letters on eBay. I remember thinking, "what a jerk she must be," and I got the book to prove to myself that she was, in fact, a jerk. But I was instantly captivated by Maynard's voice as she described her parents' tormented marriage, her father's alcoholism, and her own pathological obsession with accomplishment and success. I learned that she was eighteen and anorexic when the fifty-three-year-old Salinger began courting her, and by the time I got through the brutal details of their "romance," I decided that Maynard had every right to sell his letters: she earned them. I think some of the reactions to this memoir have been suspiciously vicious. If so many people don't want this woman to talk, it makes me more interested in what she has to say. <p>    <li><I>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</I> as told to Alex Haley -- This is kind of a tough book for a white person to read. I almost stopped reading half way through because the anger towards white people was so unrelenting, and the way he viewed white women seemed especially simplistic and unfair. It occurred to me, of course, that this was how it felt to be viewed as a color and not as a person, and given the stories he told about whites murdering his father and humiliating his mother, his anger made perfect sense. But as an individual reader who happens to be white, his generalized hatred was hard to take. I'm so glad I kept reading, though, because about three quarters through the book, he starts to question whether hating white people is really the answer. I think it was so brave of him to admit his worldview was changing when he was already famous and immensely popular for hating whites. It would have been very tempting to save face and just keep serving up witty one-liners and angry rants to the press. I think it takes a lot of courage to change your mind on a public stage. But Malcolm X was intellectually honest with himself and with his followers. And the book is particularly interesting because he's going through these changes after Haley has already started interviewing him. <p>           <b>What are some of your favorite films?</b><br>    <li><I>American Beauty</I>    <li><I>The Piano</I>    <li><I>Best in Show</I>    <li><I>A Room With A View</I>    <li><I>Goodfellas</I>    <li><I>Malcolm X</I><p>    <b>What types of music do you like? Is there any particular kind you like to listen to when you're writing?</b><br>  I like to listen to music that helps me write, that makes me think of whatever character I'm working with. I recently took a road trip from Salt Lake City to San Diego to Phoenix, and I listened to this amazing new song by Johnny Cash, "The Man Comes Around" maybe three hundred times. I just kept hitting the rewind button. It's a good thing I was alone in the car. A passenger might have murdered me. <p>         <b>If you had a book club, what would it be reading -- and why?</b><br>   Memoirs, I think. They're my favorite kind of book to read and discuss with other people. The good ones tend to be a little messier than fiction; it's sometimes less clear if you've got a reliable narrator or not. I'm reading Nuala O'Faolain's <I>Almost There</I> right now.  It's a memoir about the writing life, and it's really interesting. If there are any other good memoirs about writing, I want to know about them. (But I already know about Anne Lamott!  <I>Bird by Bird</I> is great.)  <p>    <b>What are your favorite books to give -- and get -- as gifts?</b><br>    I give away almost every book when I'm done reading it. I don't understand the point of hoarding books on my bookshelf. I figure once I read them, they're in my head, and if I want to read them again, I can go to the library. So I'm always mailing a book off to whatever friend or sister I think would appreciate it the most. I hope people don't feel pressured to read a book they don't want to just because I gave it to them. I have a friend whose boss gave her a six hundred page book that she doesn't want to read, and it's making her miserable. She thinks she has to read it. <p>         <b>Who are your favorite writers, and what makes their writing special?</b><br>    Both Margaret Atwood and Tobias Wolff tend to knock me out with their prose. Atwood is a poet as well as a talented weaver of plot, and it makes me green with envy. I like Jane Hamilton for her compassionate portrayals of characters most people would ridicule, and the way her books show the beauty of rural life without romanticizing it. Lorrie Moore is my favorite short story writer.<p>          <b>What are you working on now?</b><br>   I'm working on a book that's pretty different from <I>The Center of Everything</I>. It's set in Maine. The protagonist is male. Best of all, the narration is third person. I loved writing in Evelyn's voice for <I>The Center of Everything</I>, but first person narration can be limiting as far as word choice and metaphor. It's nice to have the free reign of third person. <p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-as-box" id="tab-edreviews" style="display: none"><div class="ds-as-box2"><div class="wrap12"><div class="poc-two-thirds"><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>In <i>The Rest of Her Life</i>, Laura Moriarty delivers a luminous, compassionate, and provocative look at how mothers and daughters with the best intentions can be blind to the harm they do to one another.<br><br>Leigh is the mother of high-achieving, popular high school senior Kara.

</p><h3>The Washington Post - 
								Donna Rifkind</h3><p>Like Kate DiCamillo's <i>Because of Winn-Dixie</i> and Sue Monk Kidd's <i>The Secret Life of Bees,</i> Laura Moriarty's first novel, <i>The Center of Everything</i>, owed its success to the immense likability of a young female protagonist. Mixing just the right combination of solemnity and cheer, Moriarty turned a potentially sappy coming-of-age tale into a full-on charmer with the voice of her 10-year-old narrator, Evelyn Bucknow of Kerrville, Kan., who courageously traversed a hard-luck childhood without any false moves. In her second novel, the author has achieved an even more impressive goal, inspiring compassion for a character unblessed with Evelyn's immediate appeal&#8230;Moriarty's novel shows that it is not literature's job to be uplifting, or even to be beautiful. It is literature's job to say yes, to every corner of every life: yes to disaffected characters like Leigh as well as to winsome ones like Evelyn Bucknow; yes to grief as much as to solace; yes to wrongdoers as well as to the wronged; and yes most of all to "our weak attempts," as Leigh acknowledges, "to feel each other's burdens."</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Moriarty's follow-up to book-group favorite <I>The Center of Everything</I> again explores a tense, fragile mother-daughter relationship, this time finding sharper edges where personal history and parenting meet. Now a junior high school English teacher married to a college professor, Leigh has spent much of her adult life trying to distance herself from her dysfunctional childhood. Raising their two children in a small, safe Kansas town not far from where Leigh and her troubled sister, Pam, were raised by their single mother, Leigh finds her good fortune still somewhat empty. Daughter Kara, 18 and a high school senior, is distant; sensitive younger son Justin is unpopular; Leigh can't seem to reach either-Kara in particular sees Leigh (rightly) as self-absorbed. When Kara accidentally hits and kills another high school girl with the family's car, Leigh is forced to confront her troubled relationship with her daughter, her resentment toward her husband (who understands Kara better) and her long-buried angst about her own neglectful mother. The intriguing supporting characters are limited by not-very-likable Leigh's POV, but Moriarty effectively conveys Leigh's longing for escape and wariness of reckoning. <I>(Aug.)</I> </P>Copyright 2007 Reed Business Information
</p><h3>Rochelle Ratner
 - 
								Library Journal</h3><p><P>It's the dream of every woman who had a troubled relationship with her mother that her relationship with her own daughter will be different, and Leigh's mother, who left Leigh to fend for herself when she was 16 years old, was certainly no role model. Unfortunately, though raised with love, care, and the financial security of an upper-middle class lifestyle, 18-year-old Kara has never been close to her mom. So when Kara, driving inattentively, accidentally kills another high school girl, past and present begin to merge in Leigh's distraught mind. While the first half of the novel is excellent, the second half is studded with what seem like unavoidable cliches. Moriarty (<i>The Center of Everything</i>) can't seem to get out of her own way; it's almost as if she's repeating information straight out of self-help books. Then there's the larger problem of transferring a novel this slowly paced to audio. Julia Gibson's narration is spirited, but Moriarty's sense of language is not well crafted enough to be fully absorbing. Recommended for larger collections.</p><h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3><p>Another novel of troubled mothers and daughters from Moriarty (The Center of Everything, 2003), whose straightforward, unadorned prose speaks on some level to every woman. Leigh and her older sister Pam came up the hard way, always the new kids at school in one nameless town after another because their divorced mother kept changing jobs. Left to fend for herself when Mom moved alone to California, Leigh struggled to make it through college. In addition to a degree in education, she also picked up Shakespearean grad student Gary. As the book opens, the couple lives in a small Kansas town; Gary teaches at the local university, Leigh at the middle school. Their daughter Kara, just about to graduate from high school and leave for college, is a golden girl who doesn't find it easy to relate to her mother. Younger child Justin, engaging but friendless, longs for acceptance from his peers. The middle-class family's seemingly golden life hits a bump in the road when Kara, driving home from school, accidentally strikes a fellow student in a pedestrian crossing and kills her. The small town that had seemed like a protective blanket suddenly becomes a city of eyes, watching and prying-or at least that's how the family perceives it. As Kara struggles with her conscience, Leigh finds herself unable to connect with her own daughter. She remembers her hardscrabble childhood and the mother she swore never to emulate. In this compelling story of female relationships-mothers, sisters, daughters and best friends-Moriarty's characters grab readers the minute they enter the story, and recollections of their vivid personalities will linger long after the last page. Well-written, convincing and impossible toput down.
</p><h3>What People Are Saying</h3><p><strong>Jodi Picoult</strong><br>Are the sins of the parents visited upon the children, or vice

fork. You'll be asking yourself what you would do in this situation, long

She thought of the stray dog, and how its presence had, in a sense, decided everything.  If there had been no dog, there would have been no accident. If the dog would have stayed home where it belonged,  if it would have had a more responsible owner, if it wouldn't have dug under a fence or slipped through an open  door, it would not have followed some scent this way and that until it ended up in the middle of Commerce Street at  that particular time on that particular afternoon. Leigh's daughter would most likely have driven home without  incident, and Bethany Cleese would still be alive.  <p>     But the dog was there, standing on the raised median of Commerce, and maybe enjoying its freedom, though  Kara later said that it was panting hard when she saw it. It was warm out, the middle of the afternoon of the last day  of school. Kara, being a senior, had already been out for a week, but she and Willow had gone back to the high  school to pick up their graduation gowns. On the way home, they stopped at the Sonic drive-thru, and when they  pulled back onto Commerce, they noticed the dog as it started to step off the median. They watched,cringing, as the  dog moved past screeching tires until it reached the other side of the street. Kara, who volunteered Sundays at the  animal shelter, who on her twelfth birthday asked her parents to take the money they were going to spend on her  presents and instead buy food for the shelter's animals, couldn't just drive away. She pulled into the parking lot of  Raymond's Liquor, where she and Willow got out of the car, crouched low, and held out their still-warm fries to  lure the dog away from traffic, into their arms, and eventually, the Suburban that Gary, not Leigh, had allowed Kara  to start driving around town as soon as she'd gotten her license.  <p>     So really, Leigh often thought, any small change in detail might have altered the horrible outcome. If the stray  would have been a different breed of dog, not so friendly, more skittish, it wouldn't have come to the girls, and Kara  would not have been so distracted when she pulled back out of the lot. Willow later told the police that they were  both laughing, trying to keep the dog in the backseat when they heard the dull thud that turned out to be the sound  of the car striking another girl hard enough to kill her. But Leigh knew there had been other distractions&#58; Kara had  been on the phone-she'd admitted that from the start. Leigh imagined the girls had the radio turned up as well,  though she never asked if this were true. Leigh was a mother capable of tact and sympathy. She tried. She was  always trying. Sometimes, however, despite her best efforts, she apparently said the wrong things.  <p>     When she imagined the interior of the Suburban in those final moments, she pictured the dog as a terrier mix,  tan, for some reason, like Benji. Leigh never actually saw the dog. She didn't even know about the dog and its  involvement in the accident until much later, even though when the accident happened, she was just seven blocks  away, teaching eighth grade English at the junior high, as she had been almost every school day for more than a  decade. She was seven blocks away, and she had no idea it had happened. Just after the ambulance arrived, Kara  used her cell phone to call her father's office on campus. Gary wasn't there, but the call had gone back to the  English Department, and the secretary, hearing the distress in the caller's voice, had tracked him down in a faculty  meeting on a different floor. Gary told Leigh later that when he got on the phone, he didn't recognize their  daughter's voice. She was crying hard, and it sounded as if she were shivering, which, he remembered thinking,  made no sense on such a warm day. When he finally understood, he gave the phone to the secretary and ran across  the neatly trimmed lawns of campus to the parking lot in his tie and jacket. He had not run so far and so quickly for  many years, and when he finally got to his car, he had to stand still for a moment to catch his breath, his hand  pressed hard against his heart.  <p>     All this happened around three in the afternoon. Leigh remembered hearing the sirens, and she felt the worry she  always did, but it was the vague worry she associated with other people's losses, other people's children. She didn't  know the sirens had anything to do with her life until she arrived home hours later, her students' final exams rolled  under one arm. She had been slightly irritated. Someone had overturned the recycling bin in the mudroom, and she  almost slipped on a stray aluminum can. Catching herself, she looked up and saw her husband and her daughter in  the living room. They were on the couch, sitting very close to each other in a way that made her think of couples  she sometimes saw in trucks, the man driving, the woman in the middle where an armrest should be. She'd made a  clicking sound with her tongue, loud enough for them to hear. They had just left the cans sitting there for her to pick  up. But then she walked closer, and she knew something was wrong. Gary had his arm around Kara's shoulders,  and his other arm held her hands down against her knees. She couldn't see Kara's face, just a tangled mass of dark  blond hair. She could see Gary's face, strained with effort, his eyeglasses crooked on his nose. And Justin, Justin  was there too. He sat on the floor, his lunch bag and backpack by his feet, looking up at Leigh as if the three of  them had been stranded there together for days, and she was the long awaited help that had finally arrived.  <p>     "What's going on?"  <p>     No one answered, and she felt the first tick of dread. But they were all there, her husband, her son, and her  daughter. So nothing so terrible could have happened. She glanced through the picture window. The Suburban  wasn't in the driveway.  <p>     "What happened? The car?" There may have been a hint of righteousness in her tone. She had been against  letting Kara drive the Suburban to school. It was Gary's old car, seven years old with a dented fender, but when  Leigh was in high school, she'd taken the bus. There was nothing wrong with the bus.  <p>     Kara said nothing, squinting up at her mother as if she were a too bright light. Maybe it was only later that she  decided this, but the way Leigh remembered it, the very moment their eyes met, even before she knew what had  happened, she had the impression that something about her daughter's face had changed in a permanent way.  Kara's posture was usually so good, but she sat hunched forward on the couch, and she looked young and small  next to Gary. Her eyes had that luminous, silvery glaze they took on when she'd been crying, and they moved from  the floor to the ceiling to the wall in quick, jerky movements. She looked like a dying bird, Leigh thought, a   fledgling kicked out of the nest.  <p>     Leigh ducked to meet her gaze, but couldn't catch it.  <p>     "What?" she said again, the t sound coming out hard. She looked at Gary, but he, too, said nothing. Leigh felt  herself getting angry. They had already formed their alliance, Leigh thought. They would not admit she had been  right about the car.  <p>     "There was an accident," Gary said, and Leigh understood by the tone of his voice that the Suburban was not  the concern. She let herself fall into an armchair, her keys jingling in her hand. Her key chain had a large, pink   heart attached to the rings-it was sentimental and cheap looking, nothing she would have purchased for herself. But it  had been a gift from Justin last Christmas, so she had dutifully clipped it to her keys. As Gary talked, Leigh saw that  Kara had scratch marks on each cheek. Gary was holding her hands down, she realized. She looked at Kara's  polished, pink nails, and turned the metal heart in her hand.  <p>     "Kara was driving. She hit someone in a crosswalk. A girl."  <p>     Kara's eyes moved in his direction, then back to the floor. Leigh held her breath. Gary's eyes were shiny behind  his glasses, and just by that, perhaps, Leigh should have known. They'd been married for twenty years, and she'd  seen him cry exactly twice-when he first learned his mother had cancer, and again on the night she died.  <p>     "What happened? What happened to the girl?"  <p>     He closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, he looked away, as if he had answered her question.  <p>     "Gary. What?"  <p>     "She died," he said. He sounded annoyed, as if she were pestering him about something obvious.  <p>     Leigh glanced through the kitchen and the mudroom to the door she'd just come in. Two minutes earlier, she'd  pulled into the garage on a sunny afternoon, another school year over, U2 playing on the radio. She'd been worried  about Mr. Tork and the PTA. Before she got out of the car, she'd looked in the rearview mirror and considered that  she had been skinny and fleshless her whole life and this was probably why her face was aging so quickly. These  things-the PTA, wrinkles-had been her concerns.  <p>     "Who?" she asked.  <p>     "Another high school student."  <p>     She braced herself. "Who? What was the name?"  <p>     Gary frowned. He loosened his tie, unbuttoned two buttons, but his shirt was stained with sweat beneath his  armpits.  <p>     "Bethany Cleese."  <p>     They both flinched. Kara had spoken, and her voice sounded unfamiliar, low and gravelly, like an old man's.  Leigh made a quick, pushing movement with her hands, but an image of Bethany came to her at once, the way she  had looked in Leigh's eighth grade class, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, sitting at her desk in the front of   the room. Leigh had had so many students over the years, and it was hard to remember the quiet ones. But last year,  she'd bumped into Bethany and her mother at the grocery store. The mother had a different last name, something  Leigh couldn't remember, and she'd had dyed blond hair, yellowy and flat under the grocery store's fluorescent  lights. She'd apologized for never making it to parent-teacher conferences. She'd been working in the evenings then,  she explained, but she'd very much wanted to meet the teacher her daughter had liked so much. Bethany had looked  embarrassed, Leigh remembered, her large brown eyes cast downward. But the mother kept talking, pushing her  shopping cart back and forth as if there were a sleeping child inside. She'd started her own cleaning business, she  said, and now she could be at home with her daughter in the evenings. Business was going well.  <p>     Leigh had nodded enthusiastically, thinking she wished she could convey that it wasn't necessary to explain all  this&#58; Bethany had been out of her classroom for a year, and she realized many parents worked evenings. But then  the mother reached into a compartment of her purse and handed Leigh a card. She had room for another client, she  said. The rates were low, the service fantastic. Bethany made a quiet growling sound and turned away for a  moment, but then they both smiled at Leigh, looking at her with their matching dark eyes. Later, when Leigh caught  sight of them in the produce aisle, Bethany had her head close to her mother's shoulder, and the mother was  laughing at something she'd said.  <p>     Leigh had thrown the phone number away. She and Gary might have been able to afford a cleaning, maybe once  a month, but Bethany's mother, even with her bleached hair, had seemed like such a neat and tidy person, with her  clipped coupons and her organized purse. Leigh would have been embarrassed, knowing how bad her house could  get.  <p>     Now, sitting stunned in the armchair and holding the metal heart key chain, she could recall Bethany's mother  perfectly, her snub nose, her high thin brows. Leigh wondered if she knew yet, and if so, how the news had been  delivered. She pictured her doubling over, shaking her head. She would hate them. She would hate Kara. Leigh  looked at her daughter. Gary had pulled her hands away from her knees, and Leigh could see the half-moon marks  her nails had left in her skin. She'd started going to a tanning booth just before the prom, and the skin around the  marks was golden.  <p>     "Oh honey," she said, and at that moment she was speaking for all of them, for Kara, for Bethany and her  mother, for Justin, and for Gary, who looked so miserable and hot. He had pale skin that burned easily, and the  afternoon light coming through the window was strong and bright. Leigh stood up and pulled the curtain shut, then  sat on the armrest next to Kara, reaching behind her so her hand grazed Gary's side. Her knees touched Justin's  small back, and for a moment, she felt stronger, knowing they were all four physically connected. It was as if she'd  been activated, a lamp plugged into a socket. But then Kara stiffened, and Leigh was certain she seemed to pull  away from her, leaning a little closer to her father.  <p>     "They just ... let her come home with you?" Leigh heard her own voice, so uncertain. She didn't know what to  say. "What did the police ..."  <p>    Gary leaned forward. "She wasn't drunk. It was an accident."  <p>     Leigh shook her head. That wasn't what she'd meant. She touched Kara's arm. Her fingers looked pale against  her tanned skin. "Were you ... She was in the crosswalk? You're sure?"  <p>     Kara shrugged. "I didn't see her."  <p>     "Why not?"  <p>     She asked this as gently as she could. But she needed to know. Everyone else knew what had happened, but she  was just learning. The information would all come to her secondhand. She would never know as much as she  should.  <p>     "Did she ... Did she run out?"  <p>     "I don't know." Kara looked up at her mother, her gray eyes wide and bright. "I can't tell you. I don't know,  okay? I don't know why I didn't see her. I just didn't."  <p>     Leigh drew back. They were both mad at her. It was this same old hurt, she thought, feeling selfish and stupid,  that brought the first tears to her eyes. She should be crying for Bethany, or not at all. She swallowed, shook her  head, and stood up.  <p>     "I'm going to make you a sandwich," she said. She didn't look back. She didn't want to hear yes or no. She  would find out the details from Gary later. But when she got to the entryway of the kitchen, she turned around and  looked at them once again. Gary's arm was still around Kara's shoulders, and it rested there in a natural, easy-looking   way. Kara was turned toward him, her cheek pressed against his chest. Leigh stared for a moment, holding  her breath. Her whole life, she'd blurred sadness with anger. She knew this about herself. She was aware. But it was  still hard to tell when this blurring was a fault.  <p>     She walked back into the living room and coughed twice. Gary and Justin both looked up, and Leigh nodded her  head toward the kitchen. When Justin started to rise, she raised her palm. At twelve years old, he could understand  subtle gestures, but Gary, the one she actually wanted to stand, stared at her dumbly from the couch. She moved  her head again and bulged her eyes. When Gary stood, she ducked back into the kitchen. She turned on the  dishwasher. There was a bag of sliced bread on the counter, but she took a loaf out of the freezer, pulled out two  slices, and put them in the microwave. She went to the sink and turned on the faucet.  <p>     "What are you doing?" Gary always had to duck a little as he passed into the kitchen, the white frame grazing  the top of his head. He liked to joke that it was the frame that was taking his hair off, a little more every year. She  took his arm and pulled him to her. "I'm making noise so she can't hear." She'd intended to whisper, but it came  out as a hiss. "My God. Tell me what happened."  <p>     He nodded, readjusting his glasses, and she saw how exhausted he looked. She could smell the dried sweat on  his shirt. It was then he told her about running across the campus lawn, how his heart had pounded, how it had  seemed to take forever to drive across town. When he got there, he'd found Kara in the backseat of the sheriff's  car, lying on her side, her arms covering her face. She'd called him "Daddy," he said. She hadn't done that in years.  <p>     "Why didn't you call me?"  <p>     He blinked. For a moment, he seemed not to know. "I tried. I tried right away, as soon as I got the call. It was  after three thirty, so I called your cell. You didn't answer. I tried again from the car."  <p>     And then she remembered. Her phone had rung when she was talking with Jim Tork. The meeting had been  tense-Jim Tork did not want his son reading <i>The Great Gatsby</i> in Leigh's eighth grade English class the   following year because-Mr. Tork had counted off each reason on a long, thin finger-the story was inordinately   depressing; it held up a decadent lifestyle as something to aspire to; it narrated adultery as if it were commonplace;   and more than one character casually took the Lord's name in vain. He was also upset about the Flannery O'Connor story,  and the memoir by Tobias Wolff. He'd looked at all the stories on Leigh's reading list, he said. The common thread,  as far as he could tell, was that they were all depressing.  <p>  <i>(Continues...)</i>  <p>    <!-- copyright notice --> <br> <blockquote><hr noshade size='1'><font size='-2'> Excerpted from <b>THE REST OF HER LIFE</b> by <b>Laura Moriarty</b>  Copyright &copy 2007   by Laura Moriarty.
