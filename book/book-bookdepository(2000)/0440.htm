				<h3>Across the Universe - Out of this frexing world!<span class="rating r50"><label>Book rating: </label><em>5</em></span></h3>
		<img src="http://images.bookdepository.com/assets/images/users/avatar_alice.gif" width="80" height="80" class="avatar" alt="Lynsey J Newton" />
		<p>When I first heard about Across the Universe by Beth Revis, I was definitely interested to read it; after all it's YA IN SPACE!!! This had me excited enough already but it wasn't until I saw the gorgeous cover and read the first chapter that I really began lusting after it. I was HOOKED from the very first chapter which is in my humble opinion *THE* best first chapter I've ever read in my life. The way Beth describes the freezing process is both horrific and fascinating at the same time. And to my surprise it didn't stop there the book just got better and better. To the point that I was sat on the train to London and some noisy children got on and sat opposite me (I am a magnet for children, I have no idea why). Anyway, usually I can't read with that much noise and distraction but I was literally SUCKED into the world inside the book and just zoned out. Here's the gist of the story:<br />
<br />
The world of Across the Universe is mostly centred around Amy, a 17 year old girl who has to make a decision early on whether or not to follow her parents (who are essential to terraforming new planets) onto Godspeed, a shape ship that will take 350 years to reach its destination. When Amy wakes, things are a little different to what she expected. For one, not only was she reanimated 50 years too early but it was no accident and she must face the realisation that someone tried to kill her. The question is why? As more "frozens" are being left out to thaw, the hunt is on for the killer. Amy teams up with Elder, the future leader of the people aboard Godspeed and together they discover that the ship holds many secrets which will make them question everything they've ever known.<br />
<br />
Amy is one of our main protagonists and Godspeed (a world in itself) is built on monoethnicity, an idea put into practice to prevent one of the main reasons for discord: differences. And of course, Amy stands out like a sore thumb with her pale skin and flaming red hair. But it is her differences that first capture the attention of Elder, our other main protagonist and by far my favourite character. Elder is second in command of the people (rather than the ship, the ship runs itself) and a future leader in training. I liked his inquisitiveness and the way he wasn't afraid to question things. And for a 16 year old boy, I really admire his courage and integrity. He certainly has the traits I would like to see in a leader. But he's frustrated because Eldest (the current leader) appears to be neglecting his duties in preparing Elder for the time when he must lead and that frustration is felt throughout the book.<br />
<br />
I thought that Beth captured the plight of a teenage girl who realises that she won't ever see her parents again and is alone in a strange, new world really well. I loved her "spunkiness", her defiant attitude that kept her going.<br />
<br />
Eldest was a very interesting character for many reasons (most of which I can't mention for fear of spoiling the book) and his steadfast belief that he is right and does what he does for the good of the people even if ethically or morally, it is wrong.<br />
<br />
I also had a soft spot for Harley and for a secondary character, I thought he was fantastic. He reminded me a bit of Finnick from The Hunger Games. I loved his artistic sensibilities and the way he took to protecting Amy like a big brother.<br />
<br />
Across the Universe is definitely a plot driven novel but I'm happy to report that the characters are also fleshed out well. I've realised recently that I need both to be truly satisfied with a story. Having said all that, I think one of the biggest selling points of Across the Universe is the world building. I'm astounded with just how believable everything is. I love the fact that accents have changed and new words have formed which is totally representative of a future society. Everyone looks the same to try and retain a sense of harmony and balance onboard the ship but everyone has a role to fulfil. One of the things I found most disturbing was "the season" which is very animalistic in nature and more about reproduction than loving relationships. I suppose in a way it's less complicated and an assurance that there will be a new generation but ewww. Again, horrifically fascinating.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of themes running through the book and I particularly liked the idea of nature versus nurture. Unfortunately I can't say much about it as I don't want to give any spoilers away. The idea of what makes a good leader is brought into the mix and we get to see the differences between a tyrannical leader and the young idealist. I watch A LOT of movies as well as read books and I can usually guess the twists and turns but I did NOT see a lot of the revelations in this book.<br />
<br />
I think one of the main messages in the book, or at least one that I got out of it was the idea that you are who you decide to be, regardless of upbringing, environment and any other outside factors. Yes, they can have an influence on you but at the end of the day, YOU CHOOSE to be who you are and I like that.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Across the Universe is an outstanding debut novel that will satisfy your need for a sci-fi adventure and romance that spans across space and time. Across the Universe was everything I thought it was going to be...and then some. I absolutely loved it and am adding it to my top reads of 2011. By the time this has been posted, I will have pre-ordered and hopefully received a finished copy of the book so I can read it and fall in love with it all over again. Please God someone buy the movie rights as that would ROCK MY WORLD!<br />
<br />
Across the Universe is out of this frexing* world and I would urge you to give it a read. The US hardback is released on 11th January, 2011 however us Brits have to wait a little longer for the paperback release on 3rd March. The as of yet untitled sequel is due out next year and I can't wait! My only request is for more kissing please!<br />

				<h3>Assured to please the vast reading industry<span class="rating r50"><label>Book rating: </label><em>5</em></span></h3>
		<img src="http://images.bookdepository.com/assets/images/content/users/780751_20101007204848.jpg" width="80" height="80" class="avatar" alt="Chasity" />
		<p>From the frame work of the crafted world to the bowels of Godspeed to the existence of life- Debut novel, Across The Universe is intricately written with ***urance to please the vast reading industry.  Although apart of me feels like tilting my head up to a swelling sky of rain drops singing  &#9835;&#9834; notes of praise there are a few things on the predictable side and worthy to note. <br />
<br />
Elder and Amy are the main characters and the narrators of the story.  I am a big fan of switch narration because it allows me, as the reader, to cover more ground.  There are few limitations which I love.  <br />
'Elder' is more of a title rather then name but it is the only name this teenage boy is addressed as because Elder is a child of the ship. The future leader of Godspeed and its people.  It is a huge pressing responsibility to bear and Elder has always known he would be the next leader.  He is also among the few populace of Godspeed who is capable of forming individual thought. <br />
<br />
Amy is a 17 year old girl from present time Earth who is cryogenically frozen along with her parents to be awakened a few hundred years down the road on a new planet.  She is considered nonessential cargo aboard Godspeed and when she awakes early she is among vast changes.  Amy, a child of present Earth (hundred years past in the novel) is capable of forming her own thoughts and opinions.  Even at a young age she is knowledgeable of facts and events that push her continuous questioning of the happenings among Godspeed.  She knows she is in a dire situation but holds steadfast with the help of Elder, Harley and a few tears. <br />
<br />
What I loved: <br />
Chapter One rocked (Read it here).  I haven't read a more engrossing beginning.  It is a teaser alright. There are two things the first chapter accomplishes: 1) It showcases the emotional journey that was felt through the entire novel and 2) It set a high bar for the rest of the novel.  <br />
<br />
The writing is brilliant and heart felt.  Teaser:<br />
<br />
    Page 49: "Yes! YES.  Wait- I'm coming.  Just give me some time to thaw, and and I will raise from the ice and live again.  I will be your frozen phoenix.  Just give me a chance."<br />
<br />
Elder.  Elder's character was my favorite.  He is from an enclosed world.  He's never set foot any kind of land nor has he seen many differences in way of race, culture and thought.  Thus, reading of his journey and fascination with Amy is like feeling things for the first time that I know all to well in reality already.  Teaser:<br />
<br />
    Page 60: "I wonder what color her eyes are.  I squint through the ice.  I can see that her eyelashes are long and reddish-yellow-frex!  I didn't know they made eyelashes like that!-but they are sealed firmly shut.  All I know is if a girl can have skin that pale and hair that red and eyelashes that sunshiny, then who knows what colors live in her eyes?"<br />
<br />
The Ending is perfect but I was caught off guard.  Elder has a secret and he told himself he wouldn't tell Amy because it's big.  This secret is something I didn't even know through the entire novel until Orion briefly made mention.  To my surprise Elder shares this secret in the final chapters and Amy, who I look forward to reading more of, come to grips with it.  Thus, the ending is complete.  Since this is a stand alone I am satisfied that all loose ends are tied up but I can also see how Across can be expanded if so be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Emotion.  Beth Revis doesn't spare her characters.  The characters that are "capable" or "allowed" to feel emotions are thrust into the thick of things.  I could not help but feel a range of emotions. Fear of enclosure.  Anger of betrayal.  Disgust of atrocious crimes against humanity.  Sadness of people and things lost.  Wonder of people and things to come.  Need of comfort.  Hope of an untainted future.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
My lists of dislikes is simple.  <br />
There were a few predicable moments.  1) Orion's identity and his scar  2) the connection among victims 3) The Plague.  To avoid spoilers I will not specify but will say that I was easily able to draw the conclusions long before it was revealed.  Does it disrupt the storyline- I dont think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Romance.  I find the blurb telling of more romance then there actually is or it's quite possible I read a bit more into the lines :"A love out of time." and "Elder, the future leader of the ship and the love she could never have seen coming."  It is obvious that Elder is smitten for the girl with sunshine hair and no doubt that Amy has feelings towards him but there was not much exploring of the relationship.  Though I am left<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, I enjoyed this novel and thankful to Shellie, a bookie friend of mine who encouraged me to read Chapter One of Across.  Thank you!<br />
I just realized that my Sci-fi adventure is continuing- *Wee heeee* From what I can tell and what I've seen on Beth's website Across is a mix of Sci-fi and dystopian.  Both of which are up my alley even more so with Across since there is Romance to make it a more well-rounded read.<br />
<br />
Note: There is sexual content surrounding of the characters but the main characters do not partake.			<em class="reviewerName">by <strong><a href="/reviews/list/author/780751" title="more reviews from Chasity">Chasity</a></strong></em>
