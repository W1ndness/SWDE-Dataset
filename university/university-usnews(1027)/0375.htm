Athletics play a big role in student life, as well, and Oberlin fields more than 20 NCAA Division III athletic teams, known as the Yeomen. Intramural sports include bowling, 4-on-4 basketball, frisbee, and squash. All students are required to live either in College housing or an Oberlin Student Cooperative Association (OSCA) co-op. OSCA, Oberlin&rsquo;s largest student organization, offers an alternative to College-run housing and dining.</p>

	Oberlin is comprised of the College of Arts and Sciences and the Conservatory of Music, which offers bachelor of music degrees and a number of master&rsquo;s programs and is regarded as one of the best undergraduate music schools in the country. The four-week winter term in January enables students to pursue a specific topic through an individual or group project; past projects have included traveling to India to study Gandhi and an intensive group course on electronic music. Oberlin also has the Experimental College, which offers for-credit courses taught by students, administrators, townspeople, and faculty that tend to focus on nontraditional subjects like the fundamentals of rock climbing or community organizing. For $5 each, students can rent up to two works of art for a semester by artists such as Picasso and Toulouse-Lautrec through the Art Rental program.</p>

        <td class="value" colspan="2"><p>Oberlin's combination of a leading liberal arts college and a world-class music conservatory creates an unparalleled learning environment. As one of the nation's premier liberal arts colleges, Oberlin is committed to rigorous academics, artistic excellence, and social justice. Oberlin College was the first in America to adopt a policy to admit students of color (1835) and the first to award bachelor degrees to women in a coed program (1841). Our esteemed history of challenging intellectual and social conventions continues to shape the student experience today. 

Our learning community prizes creativity and individuality while upholding high standards of intellectual inquiry, debate, and service to society. While faculty members are focused on undergraduate teaching, they often make significant contributions to their fields through writing, research, and performance. Oberlin students join and create more than 150 of their own organizations. Each year more than 1,200 participate in community service. Nearly 75 percent go abroad for learning experiences during their college careers. Since 1920, more Oberlin graduates have earned PhDs than have graduates of any other four-year institution. During the January Winter Term, students explore the value of self-education. They devise and pursue programs of independent study or research on or off campus. In the Business Scholars Program, for example, students interact with alumni to learn about careers in finance and consulting. The Creativity &amp; Leadership Program, open to students in any major, offers entrepreneurship courses and grants to help students put innovative ideas into practice. About 170 are enrolled in a five-year, double-degree program to earn baccalaureates in music and liberal arts. 

Students in the arts and sciences and the conservatory share residence and dining halls in the same location, joined in their commitment to pushing the boundaries of their determination, intellect, and creativity. Music students broaden their education with classes in the liberal arts, and share their talents on campus in nearly 500 performances annually. In Feb. 2010, President Obama presented the conservatory with the National Medal of Arts, the highest U.S. award given to artists and patrons. Oberlin's commitment to artistic expression includes an abundance of performances in theater, dance, poetry, popular music, and improvisational comedy. 

The Allen Memorial Art Museum collection ranks among the top five of any academic museum in the country. The Science Center (2002) is designed to promote collaboration across disciplines. Research labs include a supercomputer, confocal microscope, and 600-MHz NMR spectrometer. Each summer about 100 students receive stipends to work with faculty in science, social science, and the humanities. 

Campus architecture is also distinct with buildings designed by Cass Gilbert, Minoru Yamasaki, Robert Venturi and William McDonough. The Environmental Studies Center features the largest photovoltaic array in Ohio, and is one the largest solar-powered academic buildings in the country. This model for green architecture includes an interactive display of how the building systems utilize renewable resources to provide heat, electricity, and recycle wastewater. Opening in 2010 is a LEED platinum-rated facility for jazz studies and music recording that is the world's first green building for music. 

About 90 percent of Oberlin students live on campus. Students may opt to live in one of nine program houses, including Afrikan Heritage House, Asia House, German House, and Third World House. The 600-plus-member cooperative housing organization is the largest on any US campus, in terms of the percentage of students who participate. Nine residential coops and four dining coops (including Kosher and vegan) are student-run and provide experiences in shared responsibility and decision-making.

            <p class="first">Oberlin is the right size but the people are uninspired and uninspiring.  The professors I've had have been of average to mediocre quality.  I have essentially hated all of my classes here and plan to transfer next year.  I have been very disappointed with the level of education that I am receiving here as well as the ambivalent response I get from the administration.  I get the impression that Oberlin students essentially have to do everything themselves, and that's what I've been doing this semester.  The town is fairly lifeless, but the cost of living is nice and low.      ResEd is impossible.  I lovelovelove OSCA.  It's essentially the only thing keeping me here.  I wish somebody had told me about it as a prospie because it completely changed my life at Oberlin and switching into my coop likely convinced me to stay last semester.  Almost all of my favorite people at Oberlin eat in OSCA and I get to be around them and work with them all the time in OSCA and around the college.  I love the library system.  Not so much a fan of the registration process, though I doubt it could be done any better than it is now.      Name one thing I'd change?  I'd put Oberlin in New England and give it mountains and a river.  Also, I'd pay the professors more so that they were of a higher quality, even if it meant paying a little more to come here (I'm on a lot of scholarship, which is another plus, sort of - only downside is that I felt a lot of pressure to come here and now I'm not sure this is the right place for me).  And I'd probably offer more high-level classes in Environmental Science instead of this wish-washy Environmental Studies thing we have going on.  I am going into my third semester with only 6 more credits needed for me to complete the major.  I have been severely disappointed by the quality of the ENVS program here, despite its nation-wide recognition.  Come here to study Math or Russian or Creative Writing, definitely not environmental studies.  I feel like I came into this school with more knowledge about environmental studies than I'll leave it with, frankly.  Advising here is nothing unless you get a really good match, which I definitely DIDN'T.      Another really great thing about Oberlin is that it's extremely queer-friendly and trans/nongendernormative-friendly.  Ive been comfortable, in a social sense at least, as someone who identifies as genderqueer, which is something that is fairly uncommon even at a liberal school.  There's lots of resources for people who want support, lots of discussions going on all the time about being inclusive and educating yourself on the topic of LGBTQ culture/history AND there's tons of people to date.  So that's been nice.  Of course, I've had my share of quabbles with people, one professor in particular who was really insensitive to my needs as a non-cisgendered person, and some really really awkward moments.  But that's life.</p>

            <p class="first">I am convinced that Oberlin may be the only school in the entire country at which I would be happy. The students are extremely engaged, if not in their classes, in their personal life. Everyone is very humble, modest, unstuck-up, bright, argumentative, politically correct, and loving. Oberlin is like one big happy community, at least within the circle I hang around.    Much of my happiness, however, I owe to OSCA, the Oberlin Student Co-operative Association. OSCA is a food and living co-op organization in which students cook their own food and work (or live) together in a commune-like structure. The students in OSCA tend to be a different breed--the liveliest, most interesting, crazy and beautiful people seem to congregate around the bohemian co-ops, and they seem a relic of the Sixties. The amount of community interaction built from the coops is really incredible.    The bureaucracy at Oberlin is quite varied, and sometimes can be accessible and other times extremely infuriating. I am guessing this is no different than most other schools; however, it is very frustrating at times the number of hoops they will make you jump through, and a few administrations seem to be very inefficient, in particular ResEd.    The campus/town feels small at times, but I think ultimately this is good for the community. You can't go anywhere without running into (and interacting with) people you know, and I think this really adds to the friendly environment.     Coming from the West Coast, my biggest complaint is the weather. It's almost unbearable for me half the time, and while I love the school, one of the big lessons I learned was that I'm going to go back to the West when I graduate.    If I could change anything about the school, I would do my best to re-cultivate our ability to attracting interesting, "Bohemian" people. The administration rebranded the school recently with an ad campaign trying to shed a school image they thought was "weird." I take weird to mean anything not "normal"; we are not a school of Swarthmore preppies or stuck-up Ivies, we are socially active, Earth-loving environmental crusaders with wildly different and fascinating interests that are embraced here. To shed this image would be tragic, as it is what makes Oberlin such a wonderful, artistic, liberal place in the middle of BF Ohio.    Quite frankly, I am here at Oberlin because this is where the "freaks" are--real people who aren't afraid to act like themselves and do whatever they please. Nothing is unusual here, from nudity in the quad to puking contests in the name of "art" to men wearing dresses around campus. We are the social conservative's nightmare. Republicans run in fear from our campus, and I am proud of it.</p>
